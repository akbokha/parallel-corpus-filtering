Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
the meeting should also address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the Obama @-@ promoted deal about Iran &apos;s nuclear program has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship of the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech in front of the US Congress , which was partially dismissed as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting was rejected by the election in Israel at the time of his forthcoming election .
in an emergency call professor to have his girlfriend shot
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was important to stress that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house , the officials found the corp@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ sh and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was written by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that lamb , which taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled about 300 miles to the school site , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular story professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ sten@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police caught him .
one day after the shooting in the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details of the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly challenging teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ sh died , said he did not have a history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he men@@ tions the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with which he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some incl@@ ines to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard had no guarantee for an automatic path to an adjustment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parent &apos;s house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was going on in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb was going to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Pe@@ dago@@ gy .
he completed his doctorate in pedago@@ gi@@ cs in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ sh were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency , lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ sh , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en on his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb had been interested in music and played the blues .
lamb struck Pr@@ enti@@ sh when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ sh was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he was sitting Lamb and Pr@@ un@@ ss Night at night 5 . September last time he finished off his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ king .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday night about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the gi@@ vi@@ gi@@ l , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students back home , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt and that Lamb at his distress call Pr@@ enti@@ sh named Pr@@ enti@@ sh as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby product dealer says he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centres throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 employees were hired during the Christmas season of 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees is rising from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business moves closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to fur@@ nish shops with employees who sell , send and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arm &apos;s length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the greatest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected movie theaters in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more arms will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN boss calls for once more all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations to find a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the Council &apos;s five permanent member nations - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the si@@ delines of the minist@@ erial meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks during surveys , it did ( yet ) not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some are beginning to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate mo@@ gu@@ ins .
of course it is too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was released to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize du@@ mps staying power and start letting their bu@@ cks flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
jumps Tournam@@ ent popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey from Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures hold themselves in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a pol@@ l from CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about pumping ) .
the next thing in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely criti@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l have the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the nation &apos;s first country @-@ voting state , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nonetheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their schol@@ ar hats , Republi@@ can voters stop pumping for real .
if they are asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l from CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time that four out of ten put their money on J@@ eb Bush from the end of July .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , it is evident that a variety of GO@@ P voters look plau@@ sible for Tr@@ umps Camp@@ aig@@ n .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate Tr@@ ump hits almost every one .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to jumps , while anti @-@ tr@@ ump @-@ support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has before C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who hits him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their mind .
a new pol@@ l from C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly forgiven their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say to never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
however , Tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , immigration was the pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse for 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expres@@ si@@ veness of Tr@@ ump will deter ultimate His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post poll@@ s on Monday six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently does .
the government &apos;s fru@@ stration is climbing to new heights .
on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters is eliminated , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Monday @-@ Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than anyone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Registry / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ishly . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ k@@ h@@ weg you find the most expensive apartment - with a view over the North Sea .
on the street , a square meter of a roof housing costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in what special locations one square meter costs most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student boy in Munich are not really a bit .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top places of residence , however , there is a price like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter .
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
inci@@ dentally : Munich is not at the top for an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double scor@@ er in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have embark@@ ed on a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; mission of Milan . &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9th ) deserved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth stage success in series is scheduled to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28th matches in the Champions League for the Bavarian Leadership , Müller was awarded a generous helping of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who allowed a f@@ uss from the world champion to pass a f@@ uss .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans of hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept word .
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without gl@@ it@@ tering .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the Royal class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled here in 2011 ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim .
they proc@@ eeded cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their offen@@ sive ende@@ a@@ vors , however , they often go to work .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on the left side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely met by O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i from the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller was more fortunate from the right when his flan@@ k broke out of the right half @-@ field in the upper left of the tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown hit Poland &apos;s head ball ( 26 ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto saved with his knee ( 35 . ) .
even though Bavaria inv@@ aded its usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could place con@@ i@@ fers .
but on Tor@@ to@@ be@@ et Manuel Neu@@ er there was forgiveness .
so , for instance , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who did it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup Her@@ o has only given the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports vice @-@ president Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something else , it &apos;s vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , also Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the hing@@ ed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later .
before the game , it was cra@@ mm@@ ed in the stadium .
after a smaller group of mol@@ ded Bayern fans in their b@@ yst@@ anders had apparently provoked Pi@@ ra@@ eus &apos;s supporters with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich @-@ based trailer .
at least one of the fans of Bavaria was viol@@ ated from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : in doing so , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed over 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the link between smoking and loss of teeth results in more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the threat falls back to the level of non @-@ smokers , said Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the Birmingham University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chief Apostle H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health even to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years is affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early loss of teeth .
the new long @-@ term study shows the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists b@@ ump on lef@@ to@@ vers from the ancient ruins of Cologne
archaeological finds have been discovered on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Natural Heritage Care .
in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists now find what they are looking for .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier .
in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves that belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to weak@@ en the dispute over the proposed Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
accordingly , the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the TT@@ IP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings fores@@ ees con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Federal Court of Investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
it is planned for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
until now , the parties involved agreed to each other on refer@@ ees ; there was no possibility of a claim against their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system regarding fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it intends to work on an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there could be , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) , which were mainly requested by major corporations , are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that companies can strike compensation for tax pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or reduce consumer and environmental standards .
in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as great progress .
the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the economic potential of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
the negotiations on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement will remain unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered not to be unten@@ able .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost touched by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells of various places he always records on the map , about his meti@@ culous and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they arose and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative Ir@@ ene .
with the release of the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that nest@@ ling harmon@@ ically very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent .
the rum@@ or arises , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states in the United States should be sung in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005 .
with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and is not in the list of the most influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after very productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic fragments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but played by programmed sequences or beats and plays with any effect and rever@@ b .
since long ago the smaller clubs arose , the stage shows here became a colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and a large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the glo@@ omy Hamburg More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the significantly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can thus throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens says hum@@ bly , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally bowed down with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ ction
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut is expected to be released on the prime minister &apos;s questions
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his debut at the prime minister &apos;s frame and for the first time with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after mid@@ day , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because after his appointment as a member of the cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s spokes@@ man said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s shadow cab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC two news program that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow mini@@ ons refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they were invo@@ king differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party originally supported him as a leader .
the BBC &apos;s political correspon@@ dent Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ acking &quot; within Labour , following Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour proposes to remove the whole idea of limiting overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against government plans to reduce the amount of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised another politi@@ cian , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas on Mr Cameron &apos;s issues and gave him more than 30,000 comments .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will refrain from stri@@ pping and stri@@ fe with bar@@ rage and has instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economic Council , will represent him when he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is on the road .
he has also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally grasp the word and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became leaders in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; j@@ ester &apos;s theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s question . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the prime minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the lower house and his position among his fellow parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds rising through accelerated labor growth in the UK
the pound rapidly increased by data which indicate a rise in the growth of the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period in the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest in 2009 and has been able to estimate the date of an increase in interest rates .
the pound increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competi@@ tor group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures suggest all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again recorded growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ by selling stock as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the stocks of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his rating for the company R@@ ating .
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year period .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company , he says .
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 year old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
J@@ ustin accompanied hundreds of fans yesterday .

if J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one wonders at the window pane .

some say that the hyp@@ e is too far .
others emphasize that Bi@@ eber is in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; on No@@ .1 .

PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings your Lebanese to the idea of m@@ ashed potatoes
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
these are both - in the potato @-@ don@@ er , which the Ol@@ denburg burger dealer Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da Movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , there is a grill sk@@ ewer in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of Leb@@ ese is now to be registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
as much meat and as much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay therefore doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ a@@ quar@@ - starts a campaign to fight against al@@ di@@ -
cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched an under@@ tak@@ er campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million USD al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA @-@ supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell approved tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ a@@ cash will release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will conduct its annual Investor @-@ Strategy day .
there is much at stake since South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA network in Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will take over five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away sales of all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 billion revenue per year and $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and volumes on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars from interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purchases are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will reduce sales in food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported at a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to comment publicly on Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Met@@ cash has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operational debt at the same time pressure on sales and margins .
however , wholes@@ al@@ ers are resist@@ ing and investing more than $ 150 million to equal sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers by improving their stores with fast growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging renovation programs to El@@ an are expected to grow and hope that in 2017 , the wholes@@ aler will again return to profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the youngest of the talented Du@@ os , who is repeatedly referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight due to the in@@ famous confrontation of Cy@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the ump@@ ire , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Cy@@ gios , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; one thing I am quite en@@ vious of is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the quar@@ rel , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost because of a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he has been treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the dressing area , he is well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take Kyr@@ gy@@ agi@@ o at the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ nes &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick was very quick to get to the top of what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions . I think it &apos;s best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency stand , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and observed all those who tried to go illeg@@ ally into the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos follows on the border when hundreds of migrants joined a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the people who had fled before violence stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and scre@@ aming insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would eventually receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a prompt action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand , which was launched on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie d &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most coming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not prisoners of war who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 meter ( 13 feet ) high fence , which the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declares emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must continue to agree on the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already gotten deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now police custody and are accused of off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are quick to repair the fence .
Hungarian officials also closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to handle the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd in order to push themselves there .
some 20 succeeded in coming in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to immig@@ rate to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead over Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit promin@@ ence in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face on the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced to run for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned a few gains .
Clinton keeps a large margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have reduced .
their support among men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders only comes back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
however , Clinton has a major advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit promin@@ ence among the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the elections nationwide say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprisingly , that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about it .
the views are more strongly mixed with those currently un@@ supported by Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusi@@ astically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about its leading candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to become president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
from Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
permission to deal with the problems and the legi@@ bility are also quoted .
as the vice president raises a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s supporters claim that Bi@@ den would be far from S@@ anders their second choice .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage over S@@ anders raises from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; be@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that regards it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters stands out as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maj@@ orities view Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be@@ den cuts best with hon@@ esty among the three candidates while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions to H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as Secretary of State continue to be put in place , most of the demo@@ cra@@ cies of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on the general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion wor@@ sen@@ ed of it .
there are mostly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of those entitled to vote nationwide see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes on leadership .
from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the pre@@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to a nationwide survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS news / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of voters support the two candidates in the new survey , and others are losing dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the pol@@ l from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son was well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump among repub@@ li@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % .
the margin of errors in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support in Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest pol@@ l from ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question the du@@ mps faith .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa .
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even though peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea might be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go to the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
in contrast , bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch college new@@ bies
almost two years after a student died during a ch@@ ic@@ ane ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police informed .
officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood did not call on the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g became impot@@ ent and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide tools and basically put the good of the Brotherhood on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ sten@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 each year at the ch@@ ic@@ anes , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended prosecution for the murder of the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of slan@@ der attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
an increase in interest will come , and the ten@@ se will be shaking , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know that .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
as a result , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so severely that investors should not focus on when it begins to raise interest rates but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that the whole agitation was possibly exagger@@ ated because of interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still to a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a historical trend @-@ based view of how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen in the last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets from 12 to 24 months will be stran@@ gled after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is going on after interest increases in the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is mostly upward trend - about 14 percent - on the path to interest rate increase , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis that Bob D@@ oll , chief asset manager at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ses later in the raising cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession .
what is most remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest increases in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said .
market participants gra@@ b@@ bed the F@@ ed &apos;s interest in the whole year , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ended on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all raising cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sional heights were put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile because the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares , when they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds , yields appear to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the raising cycle , the loan officers immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jones says that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
businesses that handle the larger part of their operations in the United States will benefit from this when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firms with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns and lower volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their lower quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains from higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ins@@ ulation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; the voice of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ed with Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading MP and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that it does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also told the BBC boss that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also cited the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC Director General pointed out the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music , which is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works is also really important to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller argued that Har@@ der had to work harder to engage the public than it did in the past because the British were less informed of classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the choice of culture , media and sports to tread the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for a cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not very distinctive ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced &quot; in particular BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wants the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if there is a series of entertainment for the next time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money in the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , the lowest result since the recording began in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed the issue
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the recording began in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , that has always developed over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when shop@@ pers started making purchases using their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that comm@@ utes and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers with@@ hold their purchases prior to this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers went around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites plum@@ met@@ ed .
experts believe Black Friday , where buyers campaig@@ ning for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a British Retail Con@@ sortium &apos;s study found that £ 5 was issued a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online instead of in the furniture stores in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the blame on the collapse of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane crashed into Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
bur@@ gl@@ ers filled , mostly dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead began their last journey to the Al @-@ Renaissance ch@@ urch@@ yard .
the procession went on in the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane came through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the worshi@@ ppers .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king hung up a san@@ ction over the bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the catastrophe which left 3@@ 94 .
the corp@@ ses of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed , when a crane rush@@ ed through the Great Central Park of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual h@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the p@@ addle to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the crane &apos;s arm when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree released by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the Cran@@ e , who rush@@ ed into a courtyard of the Grand Mo@@ ika , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the p@@ addle , which takes place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree rebu@@ ked the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mos@@ que as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the royal family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes on larger construction projects .
the dead leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a back@@ sli@@ dden son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the fall of the crane came in the midst of strong winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
government officials ruled that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other injured people receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has risen
this means that 200 other scre@@ w@@ g@@ fix stores target@@ ing professional tra@@ des@@ people can be opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q sales points nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , head correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified East European craftsmen who carry out the work in their home
if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority today .
the British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ people to carry out DIY jobs in their houses , the company &apos;s boss behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new president of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
as a result , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q stores because eight out of ten buying decisions were made by women .
at the moment men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of the leading companies listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index by only five women , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in management positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales , after the Group deb@@ ated the costs of closing the stores .
due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and task ev@@ asion at the K@@ lagen@@ furt Regional Court .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of power .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the defend@@ ants used funds from the association &apos;s accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial exp@@ el@@ ations .
this fact left the chair of the opening Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that no asset was incurred by the association at any time .
the sports officials were only charged with compens@@ ations and the sports club for which they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a great deal of time and money from the debts - the liabilities amounted to about 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 EUR ) .
&quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we continue or lock the club ? &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the B@@ read@@ ed Speci@@ alist of the Financial Office .
with his co @-@ defend@@ ant and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we took money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made .
on the other hand , in the case of corresponding financial success , the payment of compens@@ ations was decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the compens@@ ations had to be paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been in the bank account .
for this reason l@@ ump sum and not detailed statements appeared , the former chairman explained the events .
the accounts and savings accounts were administered jointly by the two defend@@ ants , the second defend@@ ant said .
why the payments had not been disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
the association has not been interested in detail in the financial geb@@ ar@@ ung , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer .
when , in 2011 , against the one official investigation started for office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were appropri@@ ations , the accused declared .
this securities account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent didn &apos;t know how to answer this question for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor dropped into the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims repar@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claim compensation ? , wanted judge and prosec@@ utor to know .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he was not in agreement with this formulation because the association had never been har@@ med .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he only reck@@ oned o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets .
he charged EUR 1,000 per month to di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the accused could not present exact documents for the early years .
these were no longer kept for an audit in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter also referred to the second defend@@ ant .
all the moves were made in cash , for this purpose he had to go from his home town to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September when witnesses are questioned .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard rest@@ ys another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the number of staff cuts running for three years , the Compu@@ Ser@@ ese will disman@@ tle further jobs when spl@@ itting the enterprise .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) sub@@ missions do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning the disman@@ tling of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division .
as a result , costs of 2.7 billion dollars ( EUR 2.4 billion ) were to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the ongoing reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share sold 2.3 percent on the market .
the company , which has grown up with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is currently focusing on : this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led even more profit@@ ably in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business segments are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand by corporate customers after its services were the world &apos;s second @-@ largest manufacturer of PC @-@ based manufacturers .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
as a result , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP will respond with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions to the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently responded to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers to combat action in Iraq would overwhel@@ m the majority of them : 54 % spoke against it , 35 per cent were appro@@ ving .
61 percent of other states fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria .
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a co @-@ operation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , reject 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29 percent could not decide .
car : second day of the press at 6@@ 6th Frankfurt Motor Show
at the centre of the fair are connected , self @-@ driving cars and electro@@ mobility until September 27 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connec@@ ted Mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday after two press days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the International Motor Show from Saturday .
the organizers of the V@@ DA Car Association expect about 900@@ ,000 visitors two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : the outbreak of violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used tear gas and water @-@ laun@@ chers at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he told me by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line formed and behind the polic@@ emen was a stream of water ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials first stopped pepper spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
in this way the group was dis@@ b@@ anded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now with@@ held a little restra@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children who inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other refugees strug@@ gled together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time deciding on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is observed when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view , that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will keep .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Managing Director of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
it has warned markets to adapt to an increase , but the indications suggest that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision will be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death shake at the Delta State University left exc@@ uses
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he can und@@ o it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have killed someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency center that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ sh , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; sorry , I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , which supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ sh also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ angular relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ sh was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that she was married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ sh would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ sh were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ sh worked online at home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ sh .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ sh , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police cl@@ apped him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled walking , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his life lau on the university &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , pictured with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer .
the actor also allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was con@@ vic@@ ted of drug possession .
all of this surely calls for its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large Group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organisation .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will cost the construction of the Group the work@@ station .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
the Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap daughter Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the objective of the real@@ ignment was a contribution to earnings of some EUR 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the board for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the management board of CEO Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in future .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
to date , the organization of the company &apos;s 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict conflict with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the alleged strike on this Thursday .
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks will be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to produce viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the drivers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept is required . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is shifting routes to the Group &apos;s own equity line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double frac@@ tures
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outside Defender to cry and exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months will last , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the suspension of a mil@@ lim@@ eter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an i@@ vory and a red card are due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I am coming back more strongly . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
with the European Championship in France , the UK Defender has an additional incentive to recover until the coming June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ ard &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball going in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron doesn &apos;t know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , instead re@@ produces a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to bro@@ aden the rather short original text .
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams .
as if that were not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy sounds like the local environment through the cov@@ et@@ ous , tree f@@ elling , Th@@ ought kn@@ itting once @-@ ler , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street female speaker said that the lyrics were probably from Cameron &apos;s election district office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to reach Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the Ka@@ der who has chosen England for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a forward victory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear a sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
this is the message : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , it would have pro@@ long the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopes to get further kno@@ bs out of Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t get so good performances , and that didn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test man receives to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son - while Nick Comp@@ ton gained nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and go down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can ex@@ alt was that England first sat in the Caribbean at first - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I set high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which hit us a lot .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this of course depends on the team order in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to make Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin bowl and get four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I didn &apos;t mind about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for them , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he joined in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred R@@ uns right away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see their statistics on - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inn@@ s that lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ lah , he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the news is in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ y &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .

David Cameron &apos;s unconditional ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get into trouble with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought severely because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it , if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s all about me .
my European friend , who wants a UK looking outside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long @-@ term exp@@ and@@ als like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a lef@@ tist one .
it is hard to imagine that they will break one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even plan deliberately not helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press @-@ one , as it did during the referendum held by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name for themselves as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ Ban@@ ana &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
with all its ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ acking ali@@ ens and pseu@@ do non @-@ domestic , most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you &apos;d better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly flap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he needed no time for me to waste - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I press it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ gem@@ off tendency and the wild signs of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , when the sc@@ ou@@ ting fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father was on television to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the stir@@ red bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he even stir@@ red me up - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe that allows him to keep Labour &apos;s support in the referendum campaign for granted , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like this .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of by the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Review &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month gra@@ b@@ bed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the alleg@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to lead their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette vendor , but not the financing that he should have received according to reports previously by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the session also took part in the tobacco direction of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acknow@@ le@@ dges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; served as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the claims by BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers than tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year in a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should give up East@@ ers , former head of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for placing public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a highly controversial time window against the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to contact the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future .
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , what I consider medi@@ um@@ - or long @-@ term not for a good idea , one should at least put its production on programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as wide support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ers is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both of these self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for this .
I would like to see how this public television should be .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series leading Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe it is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments to the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts reflect what former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows should sell shows like East@@ ers .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify £ 4 billion radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
of course you think all , we all think that for £ 150 a year you get a great value , but for people who is a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s right because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called on the BBC to check its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mission to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and enter@@ tain &quot; the public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful on TV will be shown , and with the commercial channels to make alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear .
the stimul@@ i work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane can@@ als that react on ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace the deep @-@ brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultras@@ onic to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed motor @-@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with the impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus make it possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : do you travel with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) from 15 to 18 September in the characters of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ marks of the DL@@ R line , which turns into a picture of a tank .
in September , a flock of tru@@ ff@@ ers will drive with the DL@@ R ... Custom@@ ers are asked to help at the stop of the arms fair .
the 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum for cruel designs in bank@@ sys schedul@@ ing .
a collective called Special Pat@@ rol Group contributed to the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ pack of Allen keys claiming that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;
transportation for London is not fun for this &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; poster .
one of the par@@ o@@ dy advertisements produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and attempt to bring political works to the public outside of galleries .
many artists engage with activists from protest movements to work and notice that they must move out into the real world so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters are greeting the commuters in the subway .
the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the tru@@ ce trade fair - through an empty space of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation , it remains firm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture tools at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Am@@ nesty &apos;s Tom Davi@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally outside our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors fantas@@ ise fant@@ astically eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago I entered a student residence as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ed 19 year old , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now do I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residence halls ranges from slightly anno@@ y@@ ingly up to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to talk : people tell wh@@ ence you are coming , if and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand with respect to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly , Mar@@ m@@ ite can neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find the people you like as opposed to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers .
let people be .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert is a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I &apos;ve consumed for the interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student resi@@ dences had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship closed by che@@ eks .
as you start the university at the height of back man@@ ia , kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something to you . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates are committed to entertaining themselves and perhaps end up associ@@ ating your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
bad mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat tend to make people sleeping when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves even when they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that is annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced as my room@@ mate , who added a washing deterg@@ ent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it was a matter of making drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter because it was three in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly let her neighbors sleep two hours before she made her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would move into the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , it would be aw@@ k@@ ward to dis@@ connect , dis@@ connect , and then see her every day and perhaps experience how she moves all together friends to herself ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good start is funny , but it only takes moments to get to the bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but don &apos;t ch@@ ew somebody &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which will put you in the freezer - but loose their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ income ear@@ ners
real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Middle Fran@@ con@@ ian can@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for instance , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the single educ@@ ating mother and the poor servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show you how to build a cheap and good building even today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in the interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushed to the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly favourable living space can be created : he builds row houses for refugees in a project .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushed to the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because people stay in a large part here .
in view of the stream of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs the least place .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you put people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for each four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have worked out my project correctly .
especially complicated is the im@@ minent Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert built of special construction and the Ord@@ in@@ ance Reg@@ ulations .
gr@@ ump@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .

and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
this is definitely not true .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true that we had a boom in Germany over the past five years , but they built luxury apartments that hardly could afford more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living room .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner .
I show you how to build a cheap and good building even today .
that &apos;s what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone Operating System when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , since they get an error message inform@@ ing that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to deal with the problem , users are advised to wait either until the rush goes back or trying to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able through the stream@@ lining of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , since the phone may switch half@@ way and this could result in a dis@@ continuation of the update .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;

district office looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ inus have joined together under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square .
apart from consulting you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the inner city .
more precisely to the Count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office recently opened there .
from now on , immediately next to the shopping market , senior citizens receive information on questions such as health care insurance or health care services .
for years we have been working with our ambul@@ ant care service to ensure that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; even though the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ella and the City Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us , &quot; explained the new landlord in Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and .
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as resistance prevention , memory training or physio@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior center for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in the demographic transition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this necess@@ it@@ ates a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the lon@@ el@@ iness of the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite for a regular soci@@ al@@ ising . &quot;
in this way , the social foundation makes a big contribution for sen@@ iors to live as independent and good as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

the meadow bla@@ zed out of the shop , insul@@ ted the cler@@ k , and accused her of the penalty of money in front of her feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
the city of Bremen makes a confirmation of the alleg@@ ations , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I will decide whether meadow will be displayed or not .

men beating up 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on their way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft filling station .
three people also stayed on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the teen@@ ager and hit him in his face with the fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al point and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first let off his victim .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the m@@ allet and another male person .
with the aid of a beat @-@ stick man checked on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
up to now there is only a vag@@ ue perpetr@@ ator description .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters in size and was clothed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over field break practice and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from the left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ ausen .
Mr. Bernd Bor@@ mann , Mayor of Economic Development , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing happiness : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock breaks on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on the side of his successor in the next few months .
after a re@@ building phase Müller began the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was symp@@ a@@ thetic to the first glance , when the rock formation years ago Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met who currently completed their training in the Ver@@ den hospital and who also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I just ph@@ oned her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so they agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , the tw@@ o@@ fold family father Frank Müller was also raised , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several doctor &apos;s offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as the leading emergency physician in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is honorary member of the DR@@ K willingness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice for the new boss will be prepared as of September 19 .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ aus@@ ausen is a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a family practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end@@ os@@ copy is released , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler receives a total of € 50,000 in the framework of a subsi@@ dy programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses vel@@ vet Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the field of Fel@@ ic@@ ausen , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ ausen .
if no successor would have found himself , she would have gone too .
by the way , those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s consultations keep looking first and foremost in familiar faces : the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power take over from the ri@@ ms .
with their par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ aus@@ ausen re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she already felt a little sad@@ ness after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients surely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the dormit@@ ory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds , laugh@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have a 6,000 square metre plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also being rolled up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to put a request for asylum can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , not even the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to pass on arriving refugees towards Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also set corri@@ dors for the refugees .
however , this interior minister , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian wants to limit its borders for refugees but not smu@@ g@@ gling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to cross the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in the evening hours on Tuesday to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has continuously taken police vehicles with new refugees .
primarily Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country will be counting around 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , who had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed towards Croatia , con@@ sent@@ ing Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Belgrade Government , however , denied that it was it that people were wise to take certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we can , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning there was a first bus with about 50 refugees arriving in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers had been travelling through Serbia all night long from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was around 500 kilometers away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary made us , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in this way , the postpon@@ ement of the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary , already predicted by observers , could now lead to a somewhat further west stretch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of the Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had previously stressed that his country had prepared for the case of a strong inf@@ low of refugees enough plans for possible exceptional situations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen Member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since been consistently showing the country a good testimony concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the border fence .
according to the media reports , they would have spent the night at the Hor@@ gos border crossing , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down on Wedn@@ es@@ days with a local licence in Hor@@ gos : he stopped the debates about alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently deal with very high numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars

with the information captured , inside @-@ shops will have been made on the financial markets .
according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the SE@@ C announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accused in the case continued .
most of the accused came from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the U.S. and Eastern Europe .

keep track of the city .
puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle four big boards each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want .... &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and is quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as well as volunteers .
while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously acc@@ use the circle and read the phrase about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long &quot; supplements , others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again there are small discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that at some point when the end of this world comes to an end , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ itas association carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ Aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public effective action for the 20 year old is good .
however , the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets is understandable , after all it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up to people .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and value the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and supervision of the dying and mourning companions .

F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10,@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than with previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower level of view , despite the price increases , will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on 4 January and despite increased sur@@ charges for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid yields when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vac@@ ation@@ ing employment were announced a day later than those of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which were predic@@ ting twelve of Z@@ ack Investment Research &apos;s analysts .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipments , which brought sales in its unit Express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales of bo@@ d@@ fish increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result was lower due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most anticipated meeting in the years , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies will spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
there is a mur@@ al of the United States , threatening over them at one end of the decorated two @-@ story cour@@ t@@ room .
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed president Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should place the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mission from the Congress : maxim@@ ising the US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the short @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the most recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets might make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and be it just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they see , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures itself the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a wait @-@ off for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts reduce the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average jump@@ ed by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
just a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow sharpen@@ ing of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen stated in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the proposition was expected .
although the job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed considers as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would inhi@@ bit global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , whereas the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when the interest rates should be increased .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff .
now he predic@@ ts that she &apos;ll be waiting for at least one month to get the better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world economy &apos;s health is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not technically be included in the decision making process .
but the En@@ de@@ ff@@ ect has become the world &apos;s F@@ ed Currency Authority .
in recent years , the influence of the central bank has been enormous .
the mere hint of the former leader , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion dissolved conv@@ ul@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor the developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for the Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest increase cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia enabled the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a limited dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble effect on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives cancelled these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the market overnight stay , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest fixed interest .
the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il did not come close to this plane , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , president of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not without the dedication of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with both body and soul .
she is still fond of teaching the 74 sequences .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers home on D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different teaching than at a proper school .
Brazil Pedi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast @-@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to enligh@@ ten women on how important good nutrition is during lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck breasts , painted with images of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by around 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should make .
a recent study under the direction of Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried Hall Sports Hall
the Bern@@ ried municipality approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ asi@@ um construction on Bern@@ ried &apos;s sports ground is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent community meeting , the revised construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without any major discussions .
previously , the Board of Directors has , among other things , approved a proposal for an &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar panels : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings us together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again the roof slope , which for energetic reasons - should be different from the development plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan with regard to roof@@ ing did not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in which the Bern@@ rie@@ der community usually proceeds restric@@ tively in the case of exemp@@ tion orders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project in the field of gymn@@ asi@@ um : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are taken into account at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the County State Hospital , which confirmed the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the meeting will be held on Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg would continue to work .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a work place in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who declared himself ready to take the lead from October 1st with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
for the next two years , Fischer and his team will join forces with his team if the Supervisory Board agrees to hold both houses , until next year the former hospital of the pop@@ lar , which still has 35 beds , will be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , accepted rum@@ ours that the house , owned by the federal government , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer via the Qu@@ asi reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real prospect for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was under threat from closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

hunting with two injured near Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were used , as the police informed .
after a shot ceremony , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospital .
how exactly it could come to the accident was not clear at first .
the criminal police were determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missing since Saturday .
in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and thrown their corp@@ ses into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a crime of violence .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old arrested on Tuesday evening , according to the alleg@@ ations , was also suspected to be active and the investig@@ ator was responsible for the discovery of the corp@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she hadn &apos;t come home on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , investig@@ ators initially hit the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tances there was a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ees admitted to the police inter@@ rog@@ ation the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put the corp@@ se into the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be brought to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him in charge .
the further investigations are to be brought into force on the immediate circumstances of the action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of apartment gaps
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution battles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens for the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social residential construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to this conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers in an initial hospital .
many then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and are lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the rented apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers resi@@ ded in the last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is aiming for a lack of an apartment deficit , which will grow from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ ,000 units are missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Gu@@ en@@ ther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities not@@ e@@ worthy in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained un@@ tarily longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the sl@@ ums on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the large cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has been declining for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social residential construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to revi@@ ve new incentives for social housing construction .
this could be wai@@ ved on the real estate tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats can be suspended on a temporary basis .
in addition , according to the Alliance , attractive tax amor@@ tis@@ ation possibilities are necessary .
the support programme for refugee camps by the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and congregations .
a good week after the launch , more than half of the available around 300 million euros have already been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with € 18@@ 4 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the project could even be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is practically no longer going through , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Slov@@ ene Minister of the Interior and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the sealing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have gone to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian broad@@ caster RT@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day before , Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new laws , which came into force on the same day , practically render superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police picked up the first refugees at the Serbian border on the border of Serbia in the morning .
according to media reports , most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id with both the bus and taxis .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
de@@ min@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , hardly any more refugees arrive after the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 challenged people .
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prescri@@ be the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a criminal off@@ ence .
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed , Hungary , in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ ers &quot; established on the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two older people .
on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees .
practically no one has a prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself at the end of this reconstruction .
only a few refugees arrive after the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to the government &apos;s data .
around 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany in Salzburg .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ lass@@ ing there met regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor ran &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the Brü@@ cken@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the ti@@ dying up when suddenly there were ten people with travel bags at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to take the train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany on Sunday had surprisingly set off the railway traffic with Austria because of the stream of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the bri@@ des together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the near Passa@@ u .
before we had the unexpected guests first st@@ ale , with snack and drinks .
we have said that we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was natural for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler said in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man couldn &apos;t afford to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train to Passa@@ u , in order to stop at the short notice that the railway traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was stopped at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross border is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably organised a two @-@ way race day before - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent tens of thousands of thousands to us , is a logical result of an hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the construction of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially supported the position of the Hungarian government in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ ze circle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the suff@@ erer of this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic states in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge , in view of the ongoing stream of refugees and the approaching winter , to produce decent conditions for seekers of protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater one - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad is able to fully do all his hands with the refugee tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad used to know that his word has weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place districts for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chaos at the first tak@@ e@@ off centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Con@@ rad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday were also accommodated with no great vor@@ ti@@ ces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and commen@@ ded the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5.000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ned year .
in order to meet the number , 3@@ 5.000 accommodation units have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide the federal government with 15,000 .
should it become more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the provincial governor .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , with the help of how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum coordinator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also anticip@@ ates great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that district owners have to comply with a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a limited time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , is based on his experience that he is more successful in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior .
I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face the un@@ truth .
power of persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic to bear any costs as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , our own catalog search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz demands a better division
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as the tips arena and design centre for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as it is currently possible to prohi@@ bit those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the City of Vienna critic@@ ises the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) ordered further action in the refugee issue on Monday .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
however , the protective seekers were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now also carries out inspections again at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Linz &apos;s industrial line has been officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT company S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology business area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smart minds are our raw material in IT - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later to acquire them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - something Nieder@@ haus@@ er predic@@ ts : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
s &amp; T invested 1.7 million euros in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building has been lease to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center from Linz AG for 60 years .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second shop in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
in fact , Jut@@ ta W@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ad : after all , she now received an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been reconstructed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I thought for a long time whether I should open another store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor in favour of the decision was , among other things , that the ven@@ eer producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a site in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz area selling this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who herself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion @-@ interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I love most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why some women are looking for a hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional lady cannot answer with last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag of every outfit is enhanced .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
some people also associate this feature with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether it is x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalists are concerned or gaps in knowledge are revealed in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office ki@@ cks up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fo@@ eh@@ ler hair@@ style &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term for many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants are related to it over -@@ ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the city judge Sim@@ one Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their c@@ ity@@ scape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native city of K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter filmed an am@@ using documentary about the town and its famous children , including Tr@@ ump , also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , arrives at Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of a great mau@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name that K@@ all@@ stadt has within a radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the An@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the don@@ or .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a local for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the Polish , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ umps ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born b@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement regards the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so sto@@ cky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension owner Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some c@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he didn &apos;t make the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;d never been there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ emaker Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ dels &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA wo@@ ken interest .
the Upper Bavaria town of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf . &quot;
from the hands of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg@@ stei@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may not have more than 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise dominates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in the ratings for today .
N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull accomplished the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the stand seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , because sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five main cities , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number was behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today has closed the gap to Sunrise in the last few months .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 passed .
so far in September Sunrise stands at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at the age of 3@@ 14@@ .000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seri@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father who decides to settle down with his two children at New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show Solo without the Raf@@ ter star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit easy The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half @-@ hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour , 7@@ 20,000 saw it .
average Hot Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the odds of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ se@@ eding will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that did not manage to over@@ leaf the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ ann@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparent who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor , was wrapped in sec@@ rec@@ y sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ ann@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you may accidentally have given a clu@@ e about who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tight until the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , when the question is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not you who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game cor@@ rup@@ ter who won the heart of the tor@@ rent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it all over the show , &quot; Je@@ ann@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah stands on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well @-@ suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally set up for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 7 : 30 a.@@ m .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco X@@ 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League converter at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Hay@@ ne also confirmed Tom@@ sul@@ a publicly in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his lost catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian team had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the b@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his orig@@ ine debut in 2007 when a passport at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a cur@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Protection Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria , as existed during the war in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ tor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the free elec@@ torate as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need standardised standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria moves away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
many years of long @-@ standing tor@@ ches remain on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Kul@@ tus@@ Affairs Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Inter@@ medi@@ ate plus &quot; at 47 gymn@@ asi@@ ums , in which an extension of the secondary school secondary school was tested from three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want this . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 People killed after police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Senior District Inves@@ tig@@ ator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of whom threw stones and fire @-@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before returning to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used are known to be able to kill , but which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ris@@ i say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th century .
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ square @-@ area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den wants to market some 4,000 square meters of land in direct neighbourhood to the youth center Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
the plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
you wait for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor may come into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts were signed .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of the Great Street , already bought a few months ago and the building on it was torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for a holiday home on the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor was making public plans for the project for the first time .
some of the residents are still worried - they are worried about selling their leisure fi@@ gi@@ ums
months had been negotiated behind closed doors , g@@ ag@@ ged , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday resort near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized em@@ blem of the &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , who accused the investor and the administration sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann went on to the offensive from the System Construction Management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors right now .
the ten to twelve million euro project has been under discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea bu@@ ds who had come to the meeting called forth the pictures and new details about the hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , propriet@@ or and board member responsible for the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears , like many other project critics , that traffic would increase considerably due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus invitations , so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what is happening on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans were still variable .

Google La@@ un@@ ches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ aig@@ n to earn $ 11 million for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ thrown the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark train and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : Mé@@ dec@@ ins sans Fron@@ ti@@ ères , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / were doubled to 11 million $ .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ umb
for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after losing weight loss longer live than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ cer@@ ation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I of those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately the same at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes was completely dissolved and in part in 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent , and in some cases at only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after surgery , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as it is reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastro@@ intestinal group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved larger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was among obes@@ e people who underwent an obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people interested in a BM@@ I below 35 which are interested in the procedure .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have to wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , after years meets the s@@ warm of her youth , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel may be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , as he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is delighted that she was able to set up a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot absorb all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which focuses on ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we need to think about how killing is less@@ ened in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never resolved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terror attack of September 11 and issued that the violent reaction of the United States with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this problem is non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he was using violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 @-@ fold increase of dis@@ infection of hands by children over the past 4 years
poison control centers in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue from hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , reporting the poison control centers , climbed from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more into these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them arrive in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children drink san@@ iti@@ zer intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage in social media .
watch videos on YouTube , how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
young people allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very attractive for children .
dis@@ infection agents contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can cause alcohol pois@@ oning especially for small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the emergency call center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a si@@ p of whis@@ ky lying around , but people leave these hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of post @-@ straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was taken to the treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered to be drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her in the G@@ inn@@ ette Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ush@@ ed out her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors over@@ saw them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the sign of Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ en &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed after swal@@ lowing hands disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients .
health authorities may assume that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which has been listed as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ex@@ iled it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plan and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver was driving in the direction of the industrial area in the direction of the round@@ about , and it was too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he pl@@ ung@@ ed into the rear of an audi@@ torium with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fi@@ esta that was standing in front of it .

d@@ ons raise lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s el@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a short victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between Celtic and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths playing talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ours about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was rejected spontaneously by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader of the table .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football dri@@ es Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former ran@@ ger mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ ger is not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see those games .
I will turn things around , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that he must fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen , which now stands at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it that way - but we must go on .
we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ CEO of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this high season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic @-@ target person Mich@@ u with return reference
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period during the conversation , indicated that he could withdraw when his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a ru@@ sty an@@ kles for two years and has not abol@@ ished the decline of Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts stopped at S@@ FA due to lack of comments
the Hear@@ ts conducted 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the defender &apos;s Red Card was later cancelled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ co@@ sia
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was instructed after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn at Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is certain to say that I will not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tann@@ adi@@ ce Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the management board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to twist things - but it is clear that the decline in the playing field must end .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has faith in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is glad to win against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen didn &apos;t have to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton &apos;s cies in order to win a seventh consecutive league victory , giving them a margin of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , who have not won the games of this kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is rising overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the 5.5 percent U@@ K@@ s , as shown by the figures in the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland decreased by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland decreased to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment .
dr@@ unken distur@@ b@@ ance the process
because security personnel could not paci@@ fy the situation , the staff shou@@ ted to the police .
only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the stur@@ geons in custody .
a breath alcohol test showed 0.@@ 89 per mil@@ le in a 16 year old .
the growing child was picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had a mil@@ le of 2.@@ 15 and initially remained in custody .
why I Will Be Wit@@ ness to an Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later , except for a late j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal intervention , I will see a man being put to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ sy is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since more applications are available than places , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery is taking place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
she acknowledged that she could &quot; have been able to form@@ ulate it better , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ sy had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a repor@@ ter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ es would condemn him to be a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can contact for .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come from the Cann@@ ing River
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman was dry when he talked to the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer attempting to &quot; persu@@ ade him gently to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale were called on Tuesday to a house cemetery incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards Cann@@ ing River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and thre@@ aten to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tone test in Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alleg@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head raised and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a che@@ ater .
if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reig@@ ning president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ ard , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should that make me think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and leave me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now allowing them to think about it .
but I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the train@@ ee &apos;s frustr@@ ations have set up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study , and the late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching taught that he could &quot; throw off his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the failed Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s bill , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been the same last night .
it could have been the day the whole day so it was .
but it also had it on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy might be faced with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver flight

the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia visited the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged for driver flight and assistance and for other traffic off@@ ences .
the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , stays in the hospital . he is in a stable state .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals for claims to ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised Tac@@ kling his players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agenda setting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two premi@@ er league favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbitr@@ ators allowed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring battle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s coach Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised remark to the Storm team after his team had scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team vo@@ iced him confi@@ dently , as it meant that they were worried they were struck by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s up and over again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring@@ games when they kno@@ cked us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed our defensive system or techniques all year round , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus and this has brought the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and obviously he has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny as this time and again this time of the year is appearing .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting it was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team is free on this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ diction
a man who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong penalty for his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released for a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants at the marina during the mor@@ nings and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole crowd and that he could have been a harmless cause in the cafe .
the Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of flight at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars to secure his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he aband@@ ons his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports daily with the police and keeps himself at a cur@@ few between 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 in Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
in the event of a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent building site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape to the left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab of the cause of the accident broke completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ator used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of the five images , then analyzed computers that were found at the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman in order to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it was an ad@@ diction that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searching on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked them to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he was drinking , and said that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment to inc@@ ite in@@ decent images of children on June 14 last year , to viol@@ ate the conditions of the year and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , because one could argue that &quot; there is no substantial sexual element &quot; in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael shifted the verdict by October to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit in this case but was held in custody because of hear@@ ings to other cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of judgment .
slu@@ ice switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken away from the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many of the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left the people with fear of discovery and arrest more and more at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the rural districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ ub@@ s to the German side .
there , they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
at the Munich central station , according to the German Federal Police Office , there were clearly more refugees in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday .
there were around 700 people who arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : footh@@ ills of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest awaits
meteor@@ ologists warn of Stur@@ mb@@ ö@@ en in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart announced that there are currently warm sea air in the country due to a low pressure area over Western Europe .
the vigor@@ ous low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; who was dra@@ gged from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , there is still a Thursday morning in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance with gu@@ sts from 60 to 90 kilometres per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the autom@@ akers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , there is mainly movement among compact cars , which are currently particularly well selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Aviation Authority ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( September 17 to 27 ) .
this year , many new compact models are presented between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel launches an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf , starting at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16,@@ 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen provide further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only a fifth .
the second variation will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can be seen at the IAA .
and what will be added to the new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Medi@@ gan@@ e : Renault sent the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e will be seen exclusively as five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version .
he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan un@@ installer wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment .
with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti perfectly matches the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not quite new but completely renewed is the compact car model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Abbey put their hands on the front part : here the radiator grill was re@@ painted and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated into Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the pre @-@ ris@@ ed Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI can be found at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are deser@@ ving
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Cour@@ ts of Justice , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision which was published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the suffer@@ ers can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe . he was placed in a single cell with approximately five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer &apos;s claims , was now on his free foot , had been transferred to a larger cell .
indeed , due to the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the Land of Berlin , his state liability situation failed .
however , the Constitutional Court rev@@ oked the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and re@@ mitted the case to it again .
they see human dignity hurt .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation were author@@ itative , a compensation claim was given , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a h@@ ating of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of pen@@ al prisoners .
thus they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ deser@@ ving .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 for decent housing .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff at that time was placed between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe Case .
the pris@@ ons in Berlin had come to the head@@ lines for lack of personnel over the past few weeks .
therefore prisoners are imprisoned again and again 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to fights it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the judicial office , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of young ac@@ adem@@ ics , 19 should fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ vely in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of construction ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as is currently being built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing projects fall out of the rental price binding , and refugees will also apply for these particularly favourable apartments .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the subsidies , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest a grant of 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , says Claudia Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ ut@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
whereas in the past there was a prohibition of work for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as does the residence obligation that limits asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the lack of skilled labour , the outlook prevailed that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the development of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the royal road for labour integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only few wing@@ ed parents give their children to the kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only once very important for parents to keep together the family , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ jet@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in various languages .
if the demand for teachers is increasing due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for instance by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students with no knowledge of German will be prepared in the lessons .
however , they are not always taught by educated teachers , but also teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ olen from the Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state is prohibited from asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
access to the university could be facilit@@ ated by the willing refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees with a residence refund or debt do not receive services according to the asylum application law more if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally do not receive a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g since they do not fall under the circle of the authorised persons .
tolerated refugees have had to live in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g . from 1 January 2016 this span is reduced to 15 months .
however , this financing gap must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as the churches have , and the existing state @-@ church law will continue to develop into a new state religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant them certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Islamic State Council , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also have to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for everyone : what Mig@@ rant organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been demanding , and which international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany commit , must become a reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far , says District President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges to hand over health cards to all newcom@@ ers .
services rendered could later be invo@@ iced with the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to save as many people with the limited performance catalogue stipul@@ ating the asylum seekers performance law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , the doctors mainly make the language barriers possible .
as before , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more poorly educated about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpretation costs would have to be taken over , it calls for them .
but it would also have helped many refugees with more general medical points of contact in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ hin@@ dered obstruc@@ tions , and in the youth it is about HIV clari@@ fication .
with some of the other illnesses German doctors come from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the doctors are concerned , the refugees may even allevi@@ ate relief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system ; many refugees are even doctors .
in order to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therapeu@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , is particularly vulnerable .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee sc@@ are trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among others , suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong timi@@ dity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can apply for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in the Man@@ ege on the Bri@@ ck also invites you to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management of management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the Circus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for enthusiasts is therefore in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take the people away from their everyday life and to take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man cocktail with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
excell@@ ently at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown family attracts the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo brothers also understand their craft .
he wants to ease the Cuban duo with the heroes of the silent films .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - they identify themselves with these words .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is supposed to conquer female hearts in a storm .
besides through numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the Ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with a sense of intuition and ag@@ ility .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
slim people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics and is fascinated by her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t do well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , can be read from the eyes every request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the top@@ most commandment : to ensure good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together in one enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always do our best and with all our heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst takes place from September 17 @-@ 20 every day at 17 : 00 and 20 : 00 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , daily the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe positions the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , the oldest leader in Africa , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s approach with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month they cut him out and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the members of the Parliament that the immunity in Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job reduction leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP told in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive who will lead the unit after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on delivering previously un@@ riv@@ alled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to deal with the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that tightly focused enterprises provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and so long as his rehabilitation progres@@ ses according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four matches for England , and in the face of his story his participation in the European Championship is certainly uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had quit the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the high season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation by Premier Inj@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have recorded most of the injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that improvement in the injury rate will last for the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have an accidental time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win battle strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the play against Chelsea on Saturday and at Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are expected to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a short break &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al is clear favor@@ ites to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from last season with the Champions League cap@@ itali@@ zation against Monaco and remains driven away from the distant hope of leading the club to its first European triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man , aiming to question the culture that prevents men from looking for help when they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the fight to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy spirits , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally sound friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with emphasis on style and substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , viable and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality shining through the interaction as a friend .
the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football gu@@ esses in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even though they often go back to explore their feelings fully .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of telephone counsel@@ ing explained to me , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
as much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair also , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed backdrop , why don &apos;t take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to comedy Central from start to finish - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest

di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the A group , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team in one of three changes , which last weekend was 2 : 2 Un@@ decided to hold her own seat against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed to death by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an imp@@ eller was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he graduated from Johan Wil@@ and over the long corner of the net .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö played Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy opponent .
but except for a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes took up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill if he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shooting , which was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . in doing so , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth win of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had filed a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could be low before substitute player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented the change of FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was apparently a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner @-@ league winner , four times champion @-@ league winner , twice champion @-@ champion , twice champion @-@ champion , twice champion - the title @-@ list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years left FC Barcelona and moved to Qatar as al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was standing before the European Championship before the end of the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; they told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann was taken over by FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed guar@@ ola and I have played a great European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he got me with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ reuth &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the whole distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film production
matt Dam@@ on confronted A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , with regard to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it in the cast of the film and not at the filling of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted dis@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! W@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how to handle the figure of the Harmony , &quot; Brown first said .
the only black person , and she is a s@@ ut@@ te , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People fought for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on responded that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the death of teen@@ ager Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter felt the national impact and insi@@ sted on law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against dy@@ nasty stain@@ ing .
in February , the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still matter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition show , which just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the fin@@ als .
the last task was climbing at a 75 foot rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended up this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 Million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved more than $ 10,000 or had to live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to the Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , it gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he swe@@ eps a gru@@ dge over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , I am happy that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the rolls .
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ ER@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are standing on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field .
the T@@ wins lost a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American league game @-@ card place .
for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Kis@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintains its early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings 6 times and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go totally focused into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle marine on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung his but@@ to@@ cks well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good during ( punch training ) , looked far better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the but@@ t at the end of the seventh place , the T@@ wins had their best chance of coming back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier as a Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the righ@@ tist dreams of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the major league this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe has hit a Double Play
after Detroit added a School @-@ Run at the end of the ninth court , Wall created an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Blan@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
but the right @-@ handed guy stab@@ bed S@@ ano on three pit@@ ches for his fifth save .
Detroit contributed to the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the injury list before the game after he had been missing more than a month due to a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ush@@ es gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third player , Nick Castell@@ anos , followed a single at the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers laid out in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not beat well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scor@@ ing no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the relief judge A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
comment : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to an injury to the throw school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder tie , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP is kn@@ itted by Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to compete against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since 20 August because of a distortion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in target field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the persons involved in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the City of Wiesbaden , on Tuesday evening .
it comp@@ lied with refugees from 450 to 750 .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days , approximately 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse had arrived in Hessen following the announcement of the government of the government responsible for the first recording .
in addition to the large number of refugees , Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Isch@@ inger : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German military measures in Syria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the determined thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective ou@@ tre@@ ach &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military stake in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany again , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austrian interior minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there were already talks between the Director General for Public Safety and Represent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers intend to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee traffi@@ cking in Germany , the federal government wants to give stronger support to countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Ministers at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those who need protection also depl@@ ete this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but those who don &apos;t have a lead perspective can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view had been expressed as impressive as possible in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chancellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous effort of force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest that the border with Romania hes@@ itated over a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ gs from looking for alternative routes over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of migrants have been on their way to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean at Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ arius En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean ra@@ ges .
researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
so the moon ro@@ bs easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this exchange rate is only small , but still too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( United States State of New York ) on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was already known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered ice vul@@ can@@ oes at the South Pole of Saturn &apos;s moon , sp@@ itting water vap@@ our and ice particles , feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers closed back then .
the extent of the hidden ocean , however , has not been clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München will have to ren@@ ounce Val@@ det R@@ ama for about one month .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an investigation into an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury .
R@@ ama had compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich lions , the diagnosis is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a serious loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of an in@@ compatible professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the six@@ ties , however , initially presented a defensive man as a training guest .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie will be able to return to team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player is to go into running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) injured in a violent cl@@ ash on his head .
contrary to his initial fears , however , he remained without a severe Bl@@ es@@ ens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Pri@@ marily , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
in this way , those who eat the fruits support visual strength , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when you buy Man@@ gos , you should not be too soft or too firm to smell .
the colour of the shell alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as ch@@ ic@@ ory and ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS returns up to 9@@ 5,000 temporary staff for Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared on Tuesday .
especially drivers need to be looked for .
last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 temporary staff .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought the pack@@ et services to harsh criticism .
first fo@@ aming storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , the F@@ öhn winds its way through the valleys of the Alps , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the F@@ öhn blows partly with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings powerful ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest exposure .
on the north side of the Alps , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys in the night to Wednesday .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows until Thursday morning in the bo@@ oming valleys with bu@@ cks from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and in particular in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places to the adjacent middle ground , and on the mountains even or@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my f@@ öhn provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the moisture begins to st@@ ow away at the footh@@ ills of the Alps .
here rain starts which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , over 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , which has already fallen into large amounts of rainf@@ all over the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the f@@ öhn blows the air , as a result , a cold front rolling with a strong , partially weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland rolls out .
together with the cold front the wind rev@@ ital@@ ises strongly until stor@@ my , and temperatures rise significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the weekend , it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Mar@@ ino on Wednesday a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now recognized as the &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was requested by the work community of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in disgu@@ ise over centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the pla@@ za becomes visible that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
at that time , he felt the city as a do@@ omed sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions were probably reinforced by historians in his later battle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the ab@@ yss of indul@@ gence .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Old painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar Old Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who wrote his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite ble@@ ak .
Ot@@ mar Alt was working on his Bible project for about three years , for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subjects of the book of all books .
cycles emerged that dev@@ ote themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ land .
with this he immediately fascinated several partners : this is true for Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with a focus on art books .
and there is primarily the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who , based on painting , has dealt with the respective Bible passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and translated into today , in current context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Old Pain@@ ting .
they are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has gold letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to gain twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , who was born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant mon@@ arch@@ ist Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to bring myself back to the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is today marked by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is supp@@ ressed .
artists have another desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; fall in &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the image seeks his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he compreh@@ ends life with his pictures . &quot;
I didn &apos;t pay attention to the complete recording of the Bible , but also chosen the most important , mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en life and find freedom &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn is near
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway , it was finished again .
failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ one , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill shot up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will be received in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga will sign a clear sign on the weekend .
football re@@ acts to the loc@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy its help in tac@@ kling the problems facing it .
&quot; I consider this the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will meet in the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the crucial course must be the policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s , Malta .
some federal lists also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will wear the stamp &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s head of sport , Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler , said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obvi@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football allies , no , we must use our power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Cup against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a great community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was great that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects in their locations .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government , will provide 300@@ ,000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already retri@@ eved the total amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in case of accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after midnight on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then tow@@ ed out to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; it goes without saying that I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the S@@ Z .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up when you fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides skir@@ mish ...

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus vs Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes of a com@@ eback made by Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have definitely been sm@@ ashed .
the National@@ spieler will be missing at the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7@@ pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen again on Sunday , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ chel is not only able to change his trunk 11 at the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of a Roman citizen Roman citizen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teachers praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , whether the turn@@ table will be used in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ chel has left open .
with a high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the formal statement of fellow player R@@ eus that the final draft for BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl considers understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead a pioneering role in Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Finance Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Frankfurt Motor Show of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the ministry of transport under@@ lines , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid conversion to digital radio .
to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal framework and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to make use of it internationally that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study conducted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study &apos;s authors estimate the value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on the AA on Wednesday announced that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent reck@@ on with it only in 20 years , 31 percent believe not at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents estimate up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent in the United States .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ driving vehicle .
after a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , this could mean 15 percent of the traffic in flowing traffic , and 45 per cent in traffic jams .
good every fourth would leave no control to the car under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ Euro
according to current status at the title battle of September 25 to October 4 , the Düsseldorf will only want to open up in the single .
the final decision is to fall by 22 September at the latest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf during the European apprenticeship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single @-@ European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the European Championships in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then Timo was also missing , and we have become European leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the world @-@ ranking fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury to the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the great star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men into skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say today that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ached , it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total art work , which was used for a great deal of effort : to fr@@ ying the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot made 14 tonnes of material to Munich .
just before the start of the October festival there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leather trousers @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even Gau@@ l@@ tiers of old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashionable secret attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his ted@@ dy bear and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught himself the design of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought them , but of course .
for his first show he didn &apos;t have to pay for the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewel@@ ery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ en lace as a fashion niche
in the past , the long embroi@@ dery @-@ machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to walk .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were produced in a large quantity for customers who worked on them for example with blankets and curtains .
this alone is no longer working today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en company .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace fashion played a major role , was then supp@@ ressed by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , borrow@@ ed from past styles , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ en lace and embroi@@ dery industry association .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
however , private specialist stores and wholesale markets no longer exist .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
nowadays , bulk goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian area and are sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains of the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Landes@@ enst@@ elle der West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , we need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it creates a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball tip .
at some places the machine sti@@ ck@@ les small spheres .
the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ ly Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; before I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ en lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and the surrounding area and who want to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
legends are not supposed to touch , but Disney continues to venture into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el playing 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny .
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , last time with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must open wider to the outside to foster growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday to a group charged with the steering of reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should commit to attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a set of guidelines including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that do not qualify for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is significant , as it as@@ signs a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a legal business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen control over the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
open areas for private investment are opened as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attor@@ neys &apos; right to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury levels in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to make consumers a much higher dose of the pesti@@ cide .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a similar EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of inf@@ alli@@ ble industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force on pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that on the basis of the still applicable limit values approximately 50 percent of catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limits then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to intensi@@ fy the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low @-@ loaded that they already comply with the planned maximum values already today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal highly toxic to humans , which is strongly enriched in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish through the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts already can cause damage to the nervous system particularly in the case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Ministry of the Environment explains on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by the burning of carbohydrates into the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants meet the Green @-@ Members of the Bundestag Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bock more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , the Rhine and the Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , European warning of mercury in fish was already among the most commonly reported health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF ( EU warning system ) warning system .
