after checking the relevant information submitted by the Director General , the Council determines that the organisation is not capable of veri@@ fying itself by veri@@ fying that no core material which must be subject to security measures for nuclear weapons or other core bodies under Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and if necessary take the other measures fores@@ een there .
in such steps , the Council , in which measures have been achieved by the measures applied , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the advice the necessary security .
on request of the organization , community or state , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement will be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the state concerned to participate in discussing such issues by the Council .
with the exception of disputes concluded by the Council in accordance with Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another of the organization , the Community and the States shall be submitted to an arbit@@ ral tribunal , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators .
the community and the states name two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named after shall elect a fifth arbitr@@ ator .
if the Community and the States or the Organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure shall apply if within thirty days after the nom@@ ination or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been selected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the resolutions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned .
a ) This Convention stands for non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the Treaty are and members of the Community ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization notes that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this convention and
II ) if the community of the organization is notified that it is able to apply their security measures relating to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the States consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties over a change in this Convention .
B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the states .
C ) The Director General immediately teaches all Member States of the organisation any changes to the Convention .
a ) This convention comes into force on the day when the organization of the community and the states receives the written notification that their procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This convention will remain in force as long as the States Parties to the Treaty are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied when performing the provisions of the Part I concerning securing measures .
the objective of the safegu@@ arding measures defined in this Convention is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant amounts of nuclear non @-@ nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear powers for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence by the risk of premature discovery .
to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the audi@@ ts by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the quantity of material not shown for a certain period is specified by speci@@ fying the accuracy limits for the specified seas .
in carrying out its audit , the organisation according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
in applying its securing measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following manner and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how it will be determined and useful in the supple@@ mental agreements :
a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , lost core material and quantities ;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
( e ) procedures for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations of un@@ measured invent@@ ories and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that indicates the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in the material , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to refund reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures under this agreement do not extend to mining or ore processing materials .
B ) If ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ ori@@ um@@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the core fuel circuit described in the letter c ) , is introduced into the States , the organization of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced to specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material that is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ia enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the core fuel cycle .
a ) The provisions envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , however , the community considers that the recovery of core material that is subject to security measures under this Convention is temporarily not possible or desirable , the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of appropriate safegu@@ ards .
B ) The safegu@@ arding measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are unanim@@ ously determined that this core material is virtually non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures under this agreement :
a ) Special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organization releases the core material that would otherwise be subject to security measures under this agreement , provided that the entire core material delivered in the States , due to this article in the states , is not at any given time .
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight by enrich@@ ing ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ piece square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
should the released core material be processed or stored together with the core material that is subject to the safegu@@ arding measures under this agreement , precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements which , in the extent necessary to the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , determine in detail how the procedures established in the Convention are applicable .
the supple@@ mental agreements may be extended or changed without amend@@ ment to the Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supple@@ mental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake every effort to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62 , the organisation represents a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying this agreement , irrespective of its origins , and continues this inventory based on the following reports and the results of its investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EC decided to contribute to the special action plan specified at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource @-@ transfer problems .
C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the funding to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing the manner in which it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization al@@ ig@@ ns a special account under the name &quot; Special Dep@@ reci@@ ation Account , &quot; which consists of the funds that member states contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement ( in this capacity , the organization is referred to as &quot; Man@@ age &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization &apos;s deposit office in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administrator at the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different date agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator taking into account the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every member state may , upon request , make payments in advance of the aforementioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization , the administrator takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the Notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account appropriately .
under the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided according to the conditions of the E@@ EC of the following factors :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and trend of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ incentives ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly @-@ payable development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the institution &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices used for the organization funded by the organisation , which is to be taken into account by the pre@@ am@@ ble under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which have been approved for a program or project within the framework of a loan or credit which has already been approved by the directors of the bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the institution granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in ten free years each in 50 years .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this time@@ piece are to be made directly to the organization that it retains .
each special loan is to be interpreted by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the funds is given .
the recei@@ pts from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided ( i ) in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator has appointed at the time of loan , could be a recipient of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments made of a special transaction loan take place in the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the administrator shall instruc@@ t the E@@ EC until full disclosure of all the special transactions by the directors to the audi@@ tors in preparation and the plans and programs approved by the directors .
during the period of re@@ payment of a special loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC provides quarterly reports on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses for this .
the management con@@ veys the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the closing of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization for this account closure .
following full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC shall submit a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and invoices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts payable credited to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are apparent .
the E@@ EC and the administrator are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator to the complete edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not in force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the Organization may , if necessary , the agreement and all obligations of the parties are invalid with immediate effect .
if the total amount of capital received by the recipients is paid back in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC pursuant to the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the Govern@@ ments of the Member States are noti@@ fying the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedure in question .
the general secretary conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper authorisation of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organisation .
this agreement will be effective and will come into force on the first day of the month , following the date of receipt of the mentioned listing at the organization .
this agreement is framed in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each word is equally binding .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a letter of letters to am@@ end the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 on the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - HA@@ T follows :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Community , called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the project JET ( joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are named after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called the &quot; Common Enterprise JET . &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is very familiar with the area concerned .
since extensive work is to be carried out until practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion , it is in the interest of the parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research activities , which have reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement is intended to enable each contracting party to gain the greatest possible benefit by combining their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for both research work and thus achieve the common goal of these research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes identified in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it is extended or changed after examination by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement that may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
each time the parties accept a new programme , it will take the place of the programmes specified in Anne@@ x I and II to the present agreement .
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realised through : - adequate participation of each contracting party during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel among the respective laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries , with whom Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement like the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom program ;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in the project JET .
in view of the association stipul@@ ated in Article 2 Section 1 of this agreement , the contracting parties include an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or persons named &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program .
with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved with the date of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Exchange . &quot;
with regard to the participation in the project JET , Switzerland is at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement to the common company JET , whose statutes it accepts .
furthermore Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any agreement whose goal is within the framework of the present agreement , except for association agreements or other similar contracts signed by Eur@@ atom during the duration of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the association intended in Article 2 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
the association agreement , in particular , must include the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of the research work and to draw the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used as part of the Eur@@ atom program - herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task in terms of all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and al@@ ig@@ ns its competence in the interests of both parties to the common objective in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as the common objective specified in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world .
according to the Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives among the consultancy groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme , whenever the competent Swiss authorities are required .
the advisory group that provides the VG research proposals with regard to the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom program provides the best possible scientific results , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task as regards all research and development work related to this agreement .
Switzerland is represented in the Committee of Directors appointed as part of the Eur@@ atom Programme by the director of one of the laboratories involved .
the Committee of Directors , who has supervised the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and which is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , are optimally fulfilling this task in terms of all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .
he is responsible for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories participating in the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all co @-@ ordin@@ ating committees set up within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme .
coordination Com@@ mittees , which provide appropriate recommendations to the Committee of Directors for the best possible use of resources , personnel as well as the knowledge and skills involved in carrying out the Eur@@ atom program , undertake this task in the respective field of research and development work that fall under the present agreement .
the BA@@ F includes a representative of every member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country for the core and energy research .
at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the possible changes in the exec@@ utions and the preparation of the future programmes and the definition of their overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the area of the merger .
the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Direc@@ torate Committee , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordin@@ ating Com@@ mittees have a consult@@ ative character .
the opinion of the VG on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel re@@ plac@@ ements .
the representatives of the two parties work on the works of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement will be set annually to an amount that is cont@@ ested by Eur@@ atom at the cost of Eur@@ atom in the same proportion as the Swiss gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
regarding the project JET , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom at the Joint Company as soon as it is established .
in addition , Switzerland has awarded the Shar@@ ed Enterprise JET an amount which is to be determined in accordance with the financial provisions of the stat@@ ute of this common company .
the contribution made by Eur@@ atom to finance the work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on human resources exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is usually used to calculate Eur@@ atom &apos;s contributions to the financing of work carried out on the basis of the corresponding contracts .
the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year concerned .
the Federal Council will pay the Commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .

in the form of a letter of correspondence to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in order to simplify the procedure for adaptation of customs tari@@ ffs in the event of renewed changes to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contractual parties in the future , it appears further to include an article 12 to the agreement .
I encourage you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above .
I honor to confirm you the receipt of your present writing with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements via the mobili@@ zation of member states &apos; demands in the context of medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could conclude a stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded by the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor land to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units of invoice ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be ready .
in each of the stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially take over a commitment for two years , with the possibility of extensions being exceeded without being exceeded by a total of five years .
at the opening of the loans as well as the possible extension of the loan , the BI@@ S would charge a credit @-@ opening commission .
in addition , it is agreed that the first draws will not be made before the end of one month after the end of the stand@@ by agreement so that the bank can make the necessary adjustments to their own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would span periods of time taking into account the means of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those who used the BI@@ S to do business in similar conditions at the respective time , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I encourage myself to take reference to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :

the total amount specified under number 2 is set to 23 000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight on the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community .
the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community makes provisions to prevent the sale of frozen meat from frozen meat based on the regulation of the ordin@@ ance of the Argent@@ ine h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs is only valued at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these products .

the Committee shall discuss all questions arising from the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 is valid for the period from January 1 to March 31 .
the amount applicable from the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual amount and takes into account the seasonal character of the trade .

I honour myself to take reference to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled spon@@ ge - , lamb and goat meat ( F@@ are 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen mamm@@ oth , lamb and goat meat ( F@@ are 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set according to the Community to the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay has committed itself to ensuring that the quantity calculated actually does not exceed the agreed amount and is executed according to the traditional supply forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
should a change in the supply form be made possible due to changes in technology and trading , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee mentioned under No. 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community claims the clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Urugu@@ ay@@ as regulated by this agreement will not be affected by the Community market .
in the event that the imports exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year in question .
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit exhaus@@ tion on imports of products recorded by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
when accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount specified under number 2 according to the scope of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import restrictions for these new Member States shall be set down in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession agreement ; this shall take into account the ho@@ of rate of exhaus@@ tion referred to under number 5 .
the total amount specified under number 2 is set with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid a market development that could affect the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community makes provisions to prevent the sale of frozen meat from frozen meat based on the ordin@@ ance of the ordin@@ ance , not under@@ mining the Urugu@@ ay@@ an style of creation .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other support measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as from slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs is only valued at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention concerning the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay , in particular , guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular , that within the quantities set out within this agreement , export lic@@ ences are granted for the products listed under number 1 .
in turn , the Community is committed to meeting all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import licenses is made dependent on the origin in Uruguay by submitting an export license , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
it is also stipul@@ ated that the responsible Urugu@@ ay@@ an authority of the responsible authority of the Community informs the quantities in regular intervals that the export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may , if applicable , be de@@ cryp@@ ted by country of destination .
this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of the Republic of Uruguay on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Uruguay .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the law of any party , to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties prior to 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government with this letter .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen , which is homo@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur ( A ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by re @-@ di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be analyzed .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest Ser@@ um@@ dil@@ uted in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated solely by volume of blood @-@ body in@@ fusion in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has established anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ fusion .
the ti@@ ter speci@@ fies the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series , in which a micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the efficacy of re@@ agents for blood group determination , present for the International standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete Anti @-@ D ) can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( See Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sets contain according to definition 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .

if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation trials ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed in such a way that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ane in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to prevent bacterial growth , the competent authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) will be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera Human Orig@@ in for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ trac@@ ted serum .
the re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for blood group determination for the international exchange should not be arti@@ ficially colored , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the effectiveness test described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records on all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
appropriate samples of all re@@ agents have to be stored for a long time from the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the bat@@ ches are no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their active component in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain any substances of human origin .
on each individual container , a black and white label can be attached in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed to re@@ plen@@ ish ,
in addition , the label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the use instructions attached to the containers must contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

the following requirements for the efficacy of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may be changed if International standard preparations are available . ( i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is extracted from the blood of one or more people immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
