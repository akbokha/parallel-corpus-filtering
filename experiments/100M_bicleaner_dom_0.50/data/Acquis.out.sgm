<seg id="3">Considering that it is necessary to take additional measures with regard to a smooth functioning of this agreement,</seg>
<seg id="4">Considering the Ordinance of the Swiss Federal Council on 23 December 1971 on the use of the Swiss name for watches,</seg>
<seg id="5">Considering the close industrial cooperation between the European Economic Community and Switzerland in the watchmaking industry,</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the knowledge, that the rationalisation funds granted by Ebauches SA and ASUAG are abolished at the time of the entry into force of this agreement and that at the same time the quota specified in point B 3 b) of the aforementioned agreement is abolished,</seg>
<seg id="7">The customs cuts envisaged in articles 1 and 5 of the agreement, dated 30 June 1967, coincide with this agreement at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="9">Watches and movements composed of these pieces and components must meet the requirements of the legal technical control in Switzerland.</seg>
<seg id="10">2. the list of raw materials produced in the Community (Paragraph 1) will be revised periodically in accordance with the following modalities:</seg>
<seg id="11">A) The application for the inclusion of new raw material calibres to the list is directed by the associations of the watchmaking industry of the Community or the producers of crude plants based in the Community. the application is accompanied by a technical description of the raw material calibrator.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Swiss watch chamber wears this or the new calibers immediately into the mentioned list.</seg>
<seg id="13">If the inclusion in the list for a raw material is already applied, which has already been used in Switzerland and the statutory technical control in Switzerland has not passed, the Swiss watch chamber can reject the recording.</seg>
<seg id="14">B) The withdrawal of raw material calibres listed in the list is communicated by the associations of the watchmaking industry of the community, or from the manufacturer who had previously requested the recording, of the Swiss watch chamber.</seg>
<seg id="15">C) If the requirements of the legal technical control in Switzerland are not fulfilled, the Swiss watch chamber can demand the submission of the relevant raw material calibres from the list; it teaches the affected party.</seg>
<seg id="16">If this disagrees, it can take the procedure according to paragraph 3 within two months.</seg>
<seg id="17">D) Any request to change the list in accordance with the letters a), b) and c) will be immediately shown to the Geming Committee of the Swiss watch chamber.</seg>

<seg id="19">The first trading party seeks from itself the Institute for Official Quality Control in the Swiss watchmaking industry, as well as a qualified institute of the community, which is designated by the respective party of the community, in order to give a joint report.</seg>
<seg id="20">In view of this report, the institutes are able to draw attention to a batch of watches or movements from a Swiss company and from a company of the community, which is sufficiently representative and basically no more than 50 watches or movements.</seg>
<seg id="21">After checking these games according to the norms of statutory technical control in Switzerland, the institutes compare their results and create a common report for the European Commission with their conclusions and with their suggestions.</seg>
<seg id="22">The agreement and the list attached to it will be published in the official publication organs of the contracting parties and communicated to the watch manufacturers by the relevant professional associations.</seg>
<seg id="23">At least every three years, counting from the entry into force of the agreement, the European Commission is proposing a redesign of the list to take account of the entries and matches that have now been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="24">The agreement entered into force on 1 January 1973, provided that the ratification certificates were exchanged at this time.</seg>

<seg id="646">B) For the guarantee of optimal cost effectiveness, for example, the following procedures are applied: I) spatial infusion as a means to define the material balance zones for accounting purposes;</seg>
<seg id="647">III) Concentration of the verification procedures on the phases of the fuel circuit, which may affect the manufacture, processing, use and storage of nuclear material, which could be produced without further nuclear weapons and other core material, provided that this does not hinder the implementation of this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="648">A) To effectively implement the safeguarding measures under this agreement, the association of the organisation in accordance with this Convention grants information on core material that is subject to security measures, and on the characteristics of the facilities which are responsible for the implementation of the safeguarding measures relating to this material of belang.</seg>
<seg id="649">B) i) The organization requires only the minimum amount of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of its tasks under this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="650">II) Information on installations is limited to the minimum required for the application of securing measures relating to core material that is subject to the safeguarding measures under this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="651">C) In the request of the community, the organization is prepared to examine investment data that the community considers particularly vulnerable in the premises of the community.</seg>
<seg id="652">These data do not need to be materially overhauled by the organisation if they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="653">A) i) The organization takes the consent of the Community and states to the nomination of inspectors for the states.</seg>
<seg id="654">II) If the community cancels either a proposed naming or at any time against a given naming, the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative denominations.</seg>
<seg id="655">(III) If due to the repeated refusal of the community to agree to the appointment of inspectors of the organization which are obstructed due to this agreement, the Council will discuss the refusal, after the Director General of the Organization - referred to as the "General Director" - with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure.</seg>
<seg id="656">B) The Community and the States concerned undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the inspectors of the organization may actually be able to enforce the tasks underlying them according to their agreement.</seg>
<seg id="657">C) The visits and activities of the inspectors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i) are as small as possible the possible harassment and disturbance to the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection;</seg>
<seg id="658">II) ensuring the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information to the inspectors of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="659">Every state applies to the organization, including its assets, funds and balances, as well as to its inspectors and other civil servants, to carry out the relevant provisions of the agreement on the prerogatives and liberations of the International Atomic Energy Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="660">The security measures under this agreement are concluded with regard to core material, when the community and the organization realize that the material is consumed or diluted in a way that it is no longer usable for nuclear activity which is under the viewpoint of the securing measures of belang or has become virtually non-recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="661">In accordance with this Convention, the Community notes out the distribution of core material from the states that are subject to the safeguarding measures under this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="662">The security measures under this agreement will be terminated with regard to core material as soon as the recipient state, as envisaged in this Convention, has taken over responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="663">The organisation conducts documents from which any disclosure and, if necessary, the re-application of the backup measures to the continued core material.</seg>
<seg id="664">If the core material that is subject to security measures under this Convention is to be used in non-nuclear activities, such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics, the association is agreed with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the safeguarding measures can be terminated according to this agreement regarding this material.</seg>
<seg id="665">II) that the material will not be used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the duration of the non-application of the safety measures after this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="666">B) The organisation and the community agree that the safeguarding measures envisaged in this Convention will not be applied as long as the core material is used for such activity.</seg>
<seg id="667">The provision shall be determined as far as possible, how long and under what circumstances these securing measures are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="668">In any case, the safeguards envisaged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear occupation.</seg>
<seg id="669">The organisation is held on the current account of the total quantity and composition of this material in the respective state or the respective states and beyond any disclosure of such material from this state or these states.</seg>
<seg id="670">This explains their understanding as quickly as possible; it extends only on matters such as temporal and procedural provisions and agreements for reporting, but does not include approval or concealed knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the resulting use of the core material.</seg>
<seg id="671">The organization, the community and the states bear the costs that each of them will grow in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="672">If the Community, the States or the people who are subject to their sovereignty, but extraordinary costs stemming from a special search for the organization, the organization will reimburse those costs if it has been settled in advance.</seg>
<seg id="673">In any case, the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling that are required by the inspectors of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Community and the States ensure that the protection of liability for nuclear damages, including insurance or other financial security, shall be entitled to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as to the nationals of states.</seg>
<seg id="675">Any claim that the communion or state against the organization or the organization vis-à-vis the organization or the organization vis-à-vis the community or the State for damages - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - asserts that the security measures have been made after this agreement are governed in accordance with international law.</seg>
<seg id="676">After checking the relevant information submitted by the Director General, the Council determines that the organisation is not capable of verifying itself by verifying that no core material which must be subject to security measures for nuclear weapons or other core bodies under Article XII paragraph C of the Statutes and if necessary take the other measures foreseen there.</seg>
<seg id="677">In such steps, the Council, in which measures have been achieved by the measures applied, takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties concerned is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the advice the necessary security.</seg>
<seg id="678">On request of the organization, community or state, consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="679">The Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement will be examined by the Council.</seg>
<seg id="680">The Council invites the community and the state concerned to participate in discussing such issues by the Council.</seg>
<seg id="681">With the exception of disputes concluded by the Council in accordance with Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council, disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another of the organization, the Community and the States shall be submitted to an arbitral tribunal, which consists of five arbitrators.</seg>
<seg id="682">The community and the states name two arbitrators, the organization also names two arbitrators, and the four arbitrators named after shall elect a fifth arbitrator.</seg>
<seg id="683">If the Community and the States or the Organization have not named two arbitrators within thirty days of the application for an arbitration, the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitrators.</seg>
<seg id="684">The same procedure shall apply if within thirty days after the nomination or appointment of the fourth arbitrator the fifth arbitrator has not yet been selected.</seg>
<seg id="685">A majority of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitrators.</seg>
<seg id="686">The resolutions of the Arbitral Tribunal are binding for the organisation, the community and the states concerned.</seg>
<seg id="687">A) This Convention stands for non-nuclear weapons states, the contracting party of the Treaty are and members of the Community (in force, i) when the relevant state of the organization notes that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this convention and</seg>

<seg id="695">The purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied when performing the provisions of the Part I concerning securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="696">The objective of the safeguarding measures defined in this Convention is the timely detection of the branching of significant amounts of nuclear non-nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear powers for unknown purposes as well as deterrence by the risk of premature discovery.</seg>
<seg id="697">To enrich the target specified in Article 28, material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance, composite with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of the audits by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the quantity of material not shown for a certain period is specified by specifying the accuracy limits for the specified seas.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out its audit, the organisation according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for core material according to this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In applying its securing measures, the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following manner and, as far as necessary, foresee how it will be determined and useful in the supplemental agreements:</seg>
<seg id="702">A) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved, produced, lost, lost, lost core material and quantities;</seg>

<seg id="708">H) Procedure to refund reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The security measures under this agreement do not extend to mining or ore processing materials.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) If uranium or thoriumcontaining material, which has not yet reached the phase of the core fuel circuit described in the letter c), is introduced into the States, the organization of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material, provided it is not introduced to specific non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) leaves core material that is suitable for fuel production or isotopia enrichment, the plant or process phase in which it is produced, or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the core fuel cycle.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The provisions envisaged in this Agreement shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11. if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled, however, the community considers that the recovery of core material that is subject to security measures under this Convention is temporarily not possible or desirable, the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of appropriate safeguards.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The safeguarding measures envisaged in this Convention will be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13, provided that the organization and the community are unanimously determined that this core material is virtually non-refundable.</seg>
<seg id="714">At the request of the Community, the organisation liberates the following core material from the security measures under this agreement:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) Special fissile material, if it is used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">B) core material, if it is used in non-nuclear activities according to Article 13, if such core material is recoverable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with isotopic concentration of Plutonium-238, which is over 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">At the request of the Community, the organization releases the core material that would otherwise be subject to security measures under this agreement, provided that the entire core material delivered in the States, due to this article in the states, is not at any given time.</seg>
<seg id="719">A) a total of one kilogram of special material, which can consist of one or more of the following materials:</seg>

<seg id="722">B) a total of ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium with enrichment of more than 0.005 (0.5%);</seg>
<seg id="723">C) 20 metric tons of depleted uranium with an accumulation of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">Should the released core material be processed or stored together with the core material that is subject to the safeguarding measures under this agreement, precautions are made for the re-use of the securing measures on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements which, in the extent necessary to the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention, determine in detail how the procedures established in the Convention are applicable.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplemental agreements may be extended or changed without amendment to the Convention in the agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplemental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the organization, the community and the states undertake every effort to make these agreements come into force within ninety days following the entry into force of this Convention; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62, the organisation represents a summarized inventory of the entire core material underlying this agreement, irrespective of its origins, and continues this inventory based on the following reports and the results of its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States, Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC decided to contribute to the special action plan specified at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general resource-transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organization have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the funding to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing the manner in which it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization aligns a special account under the name "Special Depreciation Account," which consists of the funds that member states contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement (in this capacity, the organization is referred to as "Manage"), and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest notes of the member state, which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the organization's deposit office in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two installments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the appointed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the balance of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at a different date agreed between the EEC and the administrator taking into account the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Every member state may, upon request, make payments in advance of the aforementioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedure of the organization, the administrator takes about proportional drawing on the cash or the Notes in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account appropriately.</seg>
<seg id="741">Under the granting of these loans, the administrator can be guided according to the conditions of the EEC of the following factors:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and trend of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without disincentives; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly-payable development programme or project (including a sectoral plan), irrespective of whether it belongs to the institution's loan program or not, according to the procedures and practices used for the organization funded by the organisation, which is to be taken into account by the preamble under the letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which have been approved for a program or project within the framework of a loan or credit which has already been approved by the directors of the bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment terms, which are generally applicable to the institution granted by the organization; they are thus refundable in ten free years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for the payment of this timepiece are to be made directly to the organization that it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special loan is to be interpreted by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the origin of the funds is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The receipts from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided (i) in a member state; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, according to what the administrator has appointed at the time of loan, could be a recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments made of a special transaction loan take place in the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred back as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator shall instruct the EEC until full disclosure of all the special transactions by the directors to the auditors in preparation and the plans and programs approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of repayment of a special loan, the administrator of the EEC provides quarterly reports on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The management conveys the EEC as soon as possible after the closing of the financial year of the organization a detailed statement of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization for this account closure.</seg>
<seg id="756">Following full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEC shall submit a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and invoices, from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts payable credited to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States are apparent.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the administrator are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator to the complete edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special transactions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not in force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, which the EEC and the Organization may, if necessary, the agreement and all obligations of the parties are invalid with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of capital received by the recipients is paid back in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC pursuant to the procedural regulations of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The Governments of the Member States are notifying the Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedure in question.</seg>
<seg id="764">The general secretary conducts these notifications along with a notification of the proper authorisation of this agreement by the EEC to the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="765">This agreement will be effective and will come into force on the first day of the month, following the date of receipt of the mentioned listing at the organization.</seg>
<seg id="766">This agreement is framed in two documents in Danish, German, English, French, Italian and Dutch, whereby each word is equally binding.</seg>
