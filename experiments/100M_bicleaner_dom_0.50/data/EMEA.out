this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ ling thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness whereby the patients have alternating with periods of normal sen@@ timent .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to insert or use the gla@@ ze tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time , which are broken down in the same way as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose should be adapted by Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to communicate with each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably acts primarily as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent , acts as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , whereby psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms are reduced and their re@@ occurrence is prevented .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , with which of Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the changes in the patient &apos;s symptoms were investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to intake ( records ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg significantly reduced the symptoms of increased un@@ rest compared to those receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo .
in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented even up to 74 weeks of efficacy in placebo to restore man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo as the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled ) , ac@@ ath@@ ic ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , bl@@ urred vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , bl@@ urred vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep distur@@ b@@ ance ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mostly in man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were addressed to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I dis@@ ruption , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the market launch of Abi@@ li@@ fy throughout the European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , once a day , regardless of the meals .
increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals used as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no elevated level of su@@ ici@@ dal risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in patients with bi@@ polar disorder .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hypo@@ thal@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ fied and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if there are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia in the patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a worsen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , or an un@@ healthy li@@ festy@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central acting drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing , the common application with high @-@ acting inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism .
considering the joint offering of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefit should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should be made .
after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate rise in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yst / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation for humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies of the animal unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole decreased overall lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ z@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those of lithium .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters were observed , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
among the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , and also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the Mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch un@@ inten@@ tional or deliberate over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
there is no information about the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D @-@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ gen and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses of 0.5 to 30 m@@ g. a day more than 2 weeks in healthy volunteers the posit@@ ron @-@ emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the Put@@ stream .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients , who held a response to study medication , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies lasting 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia in week 12 , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo regarding the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N de@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for extensive metabol@@ isi@@ zers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours at bad &apos; poor &apos; metabol@@ isi@@ zers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects were observed .
a Pop@@ ulations @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the eth@@ ni@@ city or impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects encomp@@ assed a dose @-@ dependent peripheral toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Hydro@@ xy@@ - Met@@ abol@@ ites in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral exposure from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of the meals used as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in order to prevent recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the therapy should continue with the same dose .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
92 In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em ( or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate rise in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole concentrations .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D @-@ 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l as a solution for intake of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in healthy subjects , the ratio was between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Bes@@ ides , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average Ste@@ ady State Exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times of the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control as@@ tig@@ mati@@ sm and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the resor@@ ption and to minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection in the delta muscle or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely treatment ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution for intake .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with behavi@@ our@@ al and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , the patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure loss ( see Section 4.5 ) .
safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alco@@ hol@@ - or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or il@@ lic@@ it drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hypo@@ thal@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ fied and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of M@@ NS include high fever , stiff@@ ness , alternating states of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a worsen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ festy@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to the one @-@ time injection of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as one @-@ time intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly study and , at the same time , received lau@@ z@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in contrast to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; metabol@@ isi@@ zers can result in the common use of high @-@ acting inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should be made .
after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that after the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events were more common in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those of lithium .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters were observed , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
among the side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , and also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the Mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements in ap@@ toxic@@ ity / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as as@@ tig@@ ating and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding ap@@ toxic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ ame reference arm .
the mean recovery from bas@@ eline on P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour junction was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ ac@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ap@@ toxic@@ ity , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients , who held a response to study medication , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target was &apos; weight gain &apos; , an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) occurred with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy was found to reduce man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 week extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo regarding the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % greater in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole inj@@ ections was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to intraven@@ ous application no safety @-@ related concerns arose according to mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in doses or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent peripheral toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ times average steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any gift or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
considering only the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to deterior@@ ating the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer have shown that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel containing medicines .
it must also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in their blood before the treatment commen@@ ces .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that unlike other drugs containing pac@@ lit@@ axel , it was not necessary to use other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the incor@@ poration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line metastatic disease and is not indicated for the treatment of standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine therapy ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phy number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached in Grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adap@@ tations in patients with impairment of ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel containing essentially other pharmac@@ ological features than other pac@@ lit@@ axel expressions ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in patients no renewed abrasion treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ phy number has risen to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity clearly identified with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in patients after the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice any effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able .
women of child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are recommended to not bear a child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised before treatment via a sperm count , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important cases of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection was established with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an enhancement mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the co@@ agulation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by blocking their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ ce @-@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ armed un@@ f@@ aded studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 m@@ g. / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel within 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ meditation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of the patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ az@@ ation and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity towards pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses , the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were evaluated in clinical trials .
active agent exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching extra @-@ vascular distribution and / or soft tissue binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
pac@@ lit@@ axel in pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume of Abra@@ x@@ ane was higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine separation was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data are available to patients over the age of 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was verified at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours .

this means that Ab@@ sec@@ amed is a biological medicinal product approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also referred to as &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which complications could occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion if a blood @-@ blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with conditions for which the medicine is shown .
in patients suffering from kidney problems and patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ s@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the inj@@ ections may also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the whole treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients suffering from kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or because the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was incorporated into the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medical drug when inj@@ ected into a vein as part of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from an@@ emia due to kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ s@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study examining the effects of bot@@ tom@@ amed bot@@ tom@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients treated to Ab@@ s@@ amed have been maintained in the same degree as those who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the CH@@ MP Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in accordance with the regulations of the European Union the evidence has been proved that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for the medical staff in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to appro@@ ve the placing of ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia in the onset of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of larger surgical procedures requiring large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
to reduce debt levels , Ab@@ s@@ amed can be used before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except pedi@@ atric patients where the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest approved dose which is necessary for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with an initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with an initial low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms and symptoms can vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reaction number to ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reaction number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l have risen to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .

patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , ab@@ se@@ amed should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before operative intervention in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the commen@@ cement of the ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of the procedure ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days , on the day of the procedure and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients diagnosed with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive any ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently frozen heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxide oxidation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the reci@@ proc@@ ity value , considering an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the &quot; index &quot; ) , is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of a loss of activity is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be detected and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnos@@ ing a PR@@ CA should be considered .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration in maintenance therapy .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimul@@ ant active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit , which is attributable to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins , when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ ced coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumor patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 , to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 ) to hold the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible prior to the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ cs should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may arise .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins have not demonstrated that they can improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy after ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be checked and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine dose can be adjusted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ sis , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , vascular thro@@ mb@@ oses , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , retinal vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , retinal vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m , retinal vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , there may be th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications in the case of surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations .
the genetically @-@ derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and is identical with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients with regard to amino acids and carbohydrates .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an an@@ a@@ emia more consistent with an an@@ emia due to a variety of common malign@@ ancies , significantly higher mortality than in controls .
overall survival in studies could not be explained satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of obtaining a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , because too few patients were included in the checked data with these characteristics .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal experiments with nearly twice the weekly dose of the recommended weekly dose epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fö@@ tal body weight , a delay of the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports rely on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .
within the framework of an out@@ patient application , the patient can store ab@@ se@@ amed for a period of up to 3 days outside the refrigerator and not exceeding 25 ° C .
the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by an adhesive label so that if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible .

prior to the launch and agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the holder of the permit for the transport has to provide medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Education brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging .
the owner of the permit for the transport has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and installed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application is operational before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine is used in traffic .
the owner of the permit for the marketing application agrees to implement the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance , as agreed in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan specified in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and each subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan pursuant to the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time as the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use . &quot;
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • receiving new information that could affect the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the measures for risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching an important ( pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • following a request by the E@@ MEA
• Dur@@ ing a month prior to your treatment , have suffered a heart attack or a stroke • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or reinforced chest pain ) , there is a risk of blood cl@@ ots occurring in veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) - if , for example , such a drop of blood has occurred to you earlier .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or of the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent rise in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which is re@@ formed during further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , conduct regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , the elimination of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before the onset of the therapy .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ con@@ ia after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting , it will break down your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ s@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ s@@ amed until the potassium levels are back to normal .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion mark by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Ab@@ s@@ amed .
your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your ab@@ se@@ amed dose to minimize the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. when obes@@ e or obes@@ e vascular events have occurred ( e.g. deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
if you are a cancer patient , keep in mind that Ab@@ s@@ amed acts as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumor .
if you have a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of the treatment .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ s@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM CS@@ F are a means to build up the immune system , for example for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia ( an@@ a@@ emia ) responds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to ensure the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ la@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia will respond to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to make sure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor in charge will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the operation and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ ill Ab@@ s@@ amed yourself under the skin .

ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture such as H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500@@ mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or through injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
to treat Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a portion of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was investigated .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies to 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in the serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) norm@@ alized in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to those of placebo .
compared to all patients taking Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days of in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are exposed to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ar@@ se ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta manufacturer provides information material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which provides information on how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the transfer of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently dec@@ las@@ sed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • Supp@@ lement supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently dec@@ las@@ sed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures are recommended to admini@@ ster the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
patients with a recently dec@@ las@@ si@@ fied low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture recommend an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol may be reduced shortly after using acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen following the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as there are limited clinical experience for this group of patients .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) are not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data concerning safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because there are limited clinical experience for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D before starting therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient supply of calcium , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be examined before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available , whether the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol can be reduced shortly after using acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen following the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al function disorders , which were associated as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis comparable to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values that were below the normal range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received supple@@ mental sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of acet@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study reported local reactions to the in@@ fusion body , such as redness , swelling and / or pain reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 Pati@@ ents with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the case of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , an equilibrium may be obtained by offering oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once per year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients aged 75 years and over had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one around 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar flu@@ oric acid , hips and dist@@ al radi@@ us compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.@@ 7 % , total hips by 6.0 % , the th@@ igh by 5.@@ 1 % and dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic slu@@ dge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume compared with placebo and the receipt of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in the serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ teles@@ cop@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in the serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during the duration of study .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased BM@@ D at all time points compared to placebo treatment .
in comparison to placebo treatment , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % to the overall workforce and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo @-@ treated men .
in another study in men ( C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ yearly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to the once @-@ weekly dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was studied to patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was shown in two months of comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and anal@@ ges@@ ia was observed after 6 months compared to bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study ( response to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study were able to maintain the therapeutic response at 141 of the patients treated with acet@@ ron@@ ate , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , in a mean duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the big cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ -@@ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ -@@ 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimin@@ atory phase with a terminal elimin@@ atory period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the mentioned t ½ -@@ values ) represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total @-@ body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced clearance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible drug @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -

this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction to a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
as for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal @-@ acting intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in trials involving dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous use , the ren@@ al tolerance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was determined by doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection site occurred .
the most common approach in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , an@@ a@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ative effect of the substance .
at rats one observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was marked with 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low Ser@@ um calcium level .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time according to preparation and conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is structured random@@ ly , making the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by normal@@ ising bone reconstruction , ensuring a normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta , together with food and beverages , make sure you take sufficient fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if you miss the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before ending therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion frequently occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent following the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you have received such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs of low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps , ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth .
influenza , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling , anxiety , diar@@ rhe@@ a , transi@@ ent consciousness , lack of sens@@ ations , diar@@ rhe@@ a , pain in the eyes , chest pain , blood pressure , facial redness , short@@ ness of breath , skin rash , itch , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue damage and thirst .
persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or at the jaw were reported especially in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
allergic reactions including rare cases of respiratory problems , n@@ ett@@ le rash and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects are significantly impaired or notice any side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded .
in patients with a recently dec@@ las@@ si@@ fied low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to carry out the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta patients have to be adequately supplied with fluids ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure a sufficient supply of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently dated low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest acceptable dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes more effective .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in doing so , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos has led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels have been reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , an additional 0.@@ 94 % reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was added to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of acet@@ one and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin reported a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ theses ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos should not be used in patients who might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other ingredients , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the marketing of Ac@@ tos throughout the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is inadequate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 , so the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
in this study , there was an increase in reports on heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated initial liver enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on should be directed to the presence of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can stir from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
similar changes were observed in comparing controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or dual combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market introduction , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative treatment .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative treatment .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs , treatment must be dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceuticals dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
drug interactions can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on AU@@ C .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance caused during pregnancy decreases and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernal animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .

these lead to a temporary change in the lens and refra@@ ction index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic active substances .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents over three times the upper limit of the normal range were often similar to placebo , but less often than in comparison groups of met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on respectively .
since the market introduction it has rarely been reported about heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups .
in the Pro@@ Active study running over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative treatment .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days did not present any symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on appears to have activated specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose tolerance in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy was carried out for over two years to investigate the time up to the follow up of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of improvement phase with insulin were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical studies over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio showed a consistently statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was studied in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , compared with placebo , a reduction of total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and a slightly but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol level were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced total plastic matri@@ ces and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while values dimin@@ ished under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ nat@@ al increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , both of effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular diseases were random@@ ized to groups who received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the highest concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceuticals dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radioactive waste pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma reduction time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and recur@@ rent exc@@ entri@@ c heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in the gest@@ ation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernal animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ dal quin@@ ones led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative treatment .
in the Pro@@ Active Study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative treatment .
in another study for two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide were investigated .
in clinical studies more than one year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio showed a consistently statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ratio compared to the initial values .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on not only reduced the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ nat@@ al increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , which has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ mortal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to effectively use the insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that the blood sugar levels were lowered similarly to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
you may also need to adjust the doses of acet@@ one if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the complete list of the package ) .
the CH@@ MP ( CH@@ MP ) Committee concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to permit adoption of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example through intensified insulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ one in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his physician as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can , however , gradually develop : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral intake of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an un@@ seen aid or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum working time is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the duration of the activity lasts up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on the conventional safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

acet@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
also , the doses of ac@@ rob@@ p@@ id need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to introduce Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id to the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of insulin produced has to be absorbed , then the amount of the long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his physician as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .

a clinical study in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures showed that an intraven@@ ous Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id induced Nor@@ mo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum working time is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active time is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of acet@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

keep the closing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let ready @-@ to @-@ use pens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
take the cap off . • disinf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ er • always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the protective bottle from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • Take the injection needle straight and firmly to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • Dra@@ g the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • tap a few times with your finger lightly against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will collect in the cartridge at the top • Whi@@ le you continue to hold the injection needle upwards , turn the cartridge around one click in the direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues to show upwards , press the button entirely in ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now you have to leave a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle .
• Ke@@ ep the cap back in such a way that the digit 0 is opposite the metering mark ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check to see if the button is fully pressed .
the scale on the cap is 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves to the outside while the cap is rot@@ ated • The dial below the push button ( push button dial ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Record the highest number you can see on the push button • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have a wrong dose , simply turn the cap forward or backwards until you have adjusted the correct number of units .
turn it until the push button is down and you can feel a resistance take off the cap and reset it so that the 0 of the metering mark is opposite .
take care not only to press the push button during the injection - gently press the button after the injection until the needle has been removed from the skin .
it may not be accurate • You cannot set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you cannot use them to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of crystalline deposits including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or top marks ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two or four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
g@@ out attacks can still occur during the first months of treatment ; therefore , it is recommended that patients receive more medicines for the prevention of toxic@@ ity at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( placebo ) and by allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ au@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol each year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood was below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who took Aden@@ auer in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily took 120 mg , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients taking Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ uria ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with cardiac problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the CH@@ MP ( CH@@ MP ) Committee reached the conclusion that aden@@ ur@@ ic in lowering the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood was more effective than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also be a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia associated with diseases that have already led to ur@@ inary deposits ( including a medical history known or currently present and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum pole level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day .
in patients with severe ren@@ al dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients The use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended for organ transplan@@ t recipients ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or degenerative heart failure treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ acid @-@ based medicines , acute toxic@@ ation can occur during the treatment beginning , because ur@@ ic acid deposits can initially be mobili@@ zed in the tissue by lowering the serum h@@ ur@@ ic acid level .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so far that it comes to a sedi@@ ment in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , light ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before the start of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat treatment and in the further course , depending on the clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was did not conduct interaction studies on f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times a day with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without the need for a dose adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
in a study with subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays absorption of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and decreases the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not include side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or in exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably safe that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ et in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors identified in these patients were ar@@ teri@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) adverse events ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could stand in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which have been reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies included 90@@ 6 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the adverse events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data on occasion occasionally .

with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum levels ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
data from the open extension study in Phase 3 showed that the persistent lowering of serum levels of serum was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against rheum@@ atism in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment for a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the toxic@@ ity up to 24 months .
elevated TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ loc@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg a rise in AU@@ C is observed for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking easier or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ X amounts to 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentrations as long as this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are formed predominantly through C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ Glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as imm@@ utable fi@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at decreased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ y / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ y / ml in the group with severe ren@@ al end@@ ys@@ ation function .
12 Li@@ ver dysfunction after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple or@@ ally doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ d@@ osed group , at approximately 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
at high doses , which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred that accompanied by lowering the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions of approximately 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rabbit with ex@@ positions , which were about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not give ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
21 Open long @-@ term extension studies included 90@@ 6 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in every study the proportion of patients in which the last three month certain serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
data from the open extension study in Phase 3 showed that the persistent lowering of serum levels of serum was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against rheum@@ atism in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment for a g@@ out ) .

after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver dysfunction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not change significantly compared to normal liver function .

in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach levels that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble .
if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low by 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the cryst@@ alli@@ zation is prevented and in this way with time a reduction of the discomfort is reached .
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C must not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine , if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in the result of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syn@@ dro@@ ms ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which there is too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood ) .
if you have a breakdown in the moment ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , feeling of warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the toxic@@ ation is cleared before starting with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C treatment .
this does not have to be with everyone , but may occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
if necessary , your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to prevent a breakdown or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicines containing one of the following substances , since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may occur and your doctor might consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ urine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood dil@@ uting in heart disease )
no studies were carried out on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on traffic and the ability to operate machinery .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those receiving Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data showing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ) contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , tum@@ ul@@ ence ( blo@@ ating ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic tri@@ g@@ gering .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it must not be used for o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us diseases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. company for the marketing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of irrit@@ ated irrit@@ ations and related side effects ( see paragraph 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cers . • Pati@@ ents are not supposed to lie before the first intake of the day , which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cers , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract apart from p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , should be given only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tions , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some of them were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore alert attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible occ@@ lu@@ dic reactions , and patients should be reminded when symptoms of occ@@ ult irrit@@ ations such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ viral pain or new or deterior@@ ating heart@@ burn may reduce the drug and seek medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue taking it after symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was found , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , were rarely reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw , commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men mainly administered intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there is no data available that indicates whether the removal of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is author@@ itative for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids , and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
patients should therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither used during pregnancy nor by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not reveal any direct damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , ab@@ uses of serum calcium up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2,0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , Ga@@ stri@@ tis or Ul@@ cer@@ a .
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ms to Vitamin D@@ 3 .
the main effect of 1.@@ 25 @-@ di@@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is to increase the intestinal resor@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption .
in severe cases , a deficiency of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al muscles and oste@@ om@@ al@@ az@@ y can lead to an increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic persons .

patients received AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in lower thickness ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) ( n = 350 ) or F@@ os@@ am@@ ax ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ) 70 mg once a week ( n = 3@@ 32 ) ; other vitamin D supplements were forbidden .
after 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18.@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly reduced the proportion of patients suffering from vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 3@@ 7.5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate &apos;s therapeu@@ tical equi@@ valence once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 m@@ g. a day ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the Fra@@ k@@ tur @-@ Inter@@ ven@@ tional Study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III trials , the moderate asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate amounted to 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % versus placebo 6.0 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. a day for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. a day , either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate score by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption referred to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased correspon@@ d@@ ingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective in oste@@ opor@@ osis when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically significant changes in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution of rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After the intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted by the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys in rats and is therefore not believed to affect the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .
resor@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) , after the administration of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after night fasting and two hours before taking a meal , the mean area below the serum concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng / h / ml ( excluding endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) .
mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an time until the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) was 12 hours .
in the liver , biot@@ ill formation vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ lic to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 and then met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ di@@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the application of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy volunteers , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % in the urine after 4 days 4,@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data are available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests can also be reduced in patients with reduced ren@@ al function .
therefore , in patients with reduced ren@@ al function a somewhat increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone is expected ( see Section 4.2 ) .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at non @-@ clinical data based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , chronic toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
studies in rats showed that the administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was accompanied by pregnant rats with the occurrence of d@@ yst@@ o@@ ia in mat@@ ing , which was due to hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted kidney or liver to prevent the transplan@@ ted organ transplan@@ ted from the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a year of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were conducted and investigated , as Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used .
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken concur@@ r@@ ently with Adv@@ agra@@ f as the prescribed dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including sub@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of lawyer should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus surface levels should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after conversion .
day 4 the systemic exposure , measured as a level mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate night @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the one @-@ dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patient does not allow oral consumption of medicines during the first post @-@ operative phase , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be stated .
dosage recommendations - ren@@ al transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advoc@@ acy therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
further dose adap@@ tations can be necessary later , as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics can change after transplantation in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral advoc@@ acy therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ance must be converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , so this conversion has to be done in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection must begin with the oral initial dose recommended in both kidney and liver transplan@@ t .
cardiac transplantation An oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other transplan@@ t recipients Al@@ though there is no clinical experience with an oral , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ted patient , Pro@@ gra@@ f was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / day , in p@@ ank@@ re@@ ast transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders to decrease the dose .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Because the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine lear@@ ance and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of re@@ pul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level checks .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adaptation , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could alter the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred .
the data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the levels of the valley do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the whole blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be effective against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the res@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
in addition to pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult patients with heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipients , there are no clinical data for the res@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to avoid any other herbal remedy during a treatment with adv@@ enti@@ ation ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea a particularly careful observation of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , there was a known as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy called v@@ entri@@ cular or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical ab@@ norm@@ alities are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid retention and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headaches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ ated , lac@@ tose , special caution is required in patients with rare heredi@@ tary lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while adding substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ media antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as is used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives , and thus increase the endo@@ cr@@ ine exposition , it is especially cau@@ tious when decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are to be taken .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ on and extend its half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ in@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 infants , i.e. :
the side @-@ efficacy profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not exactly determined because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the side effects are listed below after their frequency in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs , patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus often increase the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viruses , bacterial , my@@ k@@ otic , proto@@ zo@@ als ) .
cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with adv@@ enti@@ st .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were reported .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ m@@ able .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell nucleus .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thus preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ anic genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus op@@ presses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the large studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation An interim analysis of a recently conducted multic@@ entre study of oral pro@@ gra@@ f has reported over 110 patients who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis &apos;s ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it came to 2@@ 1,7 % of cases for the development of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be switched to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases where there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group patients ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multic@@ enter study of oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed to 205 patients who simultaneously received pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation , which were random@@ ized to receive tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral Initi@@ al dosage ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached by reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after bow@@ el transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for the early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional dose of inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ists d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to seb@@ um between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently gra@@ ft radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids shall be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly through the bile .
in stable patients , which were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to the full day dose ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ ance was approximately 10 % lower than in Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be effective against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the res@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical ab@@ norm@@ alities are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid retention and ede@@ ma .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital heart disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application is based on whether agents are used for the treatment of ble@@ ed@@ ings or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
lawyer is similar to another in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently , so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of adv@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges with &quot; excellent &quot; respectively &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or witch protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit to market lawyers across the European Union .
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the place and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
repeat every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma cruci@@ ble is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
in response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients can differentiate themselves in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ lives .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis The long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the administration speed should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , where the risk within the first 20 position days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ days and am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development , switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ ti@@ tr@@ ins ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , who showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II mirrors in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th day of the day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate @-@ severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE .
in addition , no F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was found in none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients from an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE treated patients with inhibit@@ ors versus factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O @-@ cell protein , but there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ le gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions was reported in the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , based on the A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP has decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited officially informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company receives its application for approval of the marketing of adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones , or the soft parts ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce any copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer occurred in the area of the under@@ belly , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions it had been asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP grants a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
in the opinion of the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the inj@@ ections of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ wom@@ men@@ i @-@ tumours carry benefits for the patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform CH@@ MP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ bi @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified ingredient release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other released slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cleared .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the onset of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in case of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on their own .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who did not alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intraocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ) or have a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ rho@@ ea ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transfer of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without sh@@ red@@ ding , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms are finished .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lis@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiva , the per@@ oral or nas@@ al as a di@@ gest@@ ed Rhin@@ opla@@ sty ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or ampli@@ fication of the headache ) must be stopped .
care should be taken when treating the following patient groups : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent .
in the course of clinical trials involving Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with chlor@@ osis and placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transfer@@ ed to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to a di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ ential processes .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mic@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , predic@@ tive pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin receptor on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flux , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine at recommended dosage can cause further li@@ ke@@ able effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , whereas 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine via the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show any significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration .
after the oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze for healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the course of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test persons were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component @-@ interaction study showed that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the only gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to exposure after administration of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tears or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

inform your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases with the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • Heart ch@@ asing , pal@@ pit@@ ations • Cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • nausea and headache , or a strengthening of existing headaches .
when taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
traffic @-@ ti@@ ghtness and the operation of machines In the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness or reduces attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take a dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose on time , use the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you notice significantly affects you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , neck pain , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was very rare reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin rash .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , var@@ ic@@ ose veins , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of abnormal liver disease has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( among them four studies with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies to patients who had asthma ) .
effectiveness was measured by determining the change in the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rup@@ ed , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the gla@@ ze tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous course of illness and can be termin@@ ated after the end of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed at their recur@@ rence .
in case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( onset of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended for an ongoing treatment during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % of patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily compared to those treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common adverse event was a headache , which was treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with &quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n &quot; and 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dosage ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ enium adhesi@@ on molecule to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flux , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be classified as an alternative also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown in the overall results of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar to the eti@@ ology of the different forms and can be easily recru@@ ited for chronic patients .
since hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all age @-@ related diseases , it is expected that in addition to the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria may lead to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with ob@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , where the patient &apos;s findings were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of the patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken regardless of meals , to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
around 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance concentrations ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 that can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed is identical to that of children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ lac@@ tose @-@ absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ I@@ som@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup group , similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dosage ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily total dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the child population in adults .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents did not determine an increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
at a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents did not interfere with psych@@ om@@ otor impairment .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither led to a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced performance impairment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown in the overall results of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets will effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation for children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which metabol@@ ise fully metabol@@ ised .
the load ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable with the recommended doses of those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were used , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied at a dose of 45 mg daily ( nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval showed .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day compared to placebo .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flux , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown in the overall results of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster has to be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets for the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven yet .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the loss and placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile observed in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tray was the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the context of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flux , including the strengthening of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this badly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) bigger than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( A@@ wak@@ ening 2 % , children 3 % ) , however the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us fusion tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for intake , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze limited , is identical to that of children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tos@@ e- intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ omer@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in infants aged 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , at one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ ol@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day for adults and adolescents did not determine an increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively also be in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
as shown in the overall results of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effectively reducing the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s solution for intake contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no Bio@@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it comp@@ lies with the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
various single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable with the recommended doses to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for intake is available in bottles with a child@@ proof cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml pack size is a measuring spoon or application sy@@ ringe f@@ û@@ r preparations for intake with sc@@ aling of 2.5 m@@ l@@ - and 5 ml cans .
in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially informed the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recogn@@ ises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce antibodies with a flu virus in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recogn@@ ises as a body alien ) was puri@@ fied and used as an integral part of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you wish to participate in a clinical examination and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor treating .
for more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , who are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been investigated .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed once the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medicines the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus will be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years of age and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which was fortified with low @-@ d@@ osed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to be prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alter@@ ation of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few people responded to the treatment of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study involving adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the A@@ gener@@ ase drug , enhanced by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 16 weeks of treatment :
in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ers , A@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , came to a greater decrease in the viral load after four weeks compared to those patients who continued their prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
ag@@ asy must also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depres@@ sions ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded as well as ag@@ asy and are health @-@ harmful in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines against HIV , there is a risk of cereb@@ ral disease ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the CH@@ MP ( CH@@ MP ) Committee concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children were out@@ weighed over four years versus the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of as@@ generic ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the transport of ag@@ asy in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) in adults and children aged 4 and over .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the enhancing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of ag@@ asy ( 1200 mg twice a day ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ generic ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
ag@@ asy is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
as@@ generic ase should not be given concur@@ r@@ ently with pharmaceuticals that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 iso@@ cy@@ te 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver damage with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of h@@ ep@@ atic dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ est@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For certain medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration .
in patients who take these drugs at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of drug interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given concur@@ r@@ ently with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
ag@@ asy should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to which medicines were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in h@@ ep@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ at@@ omas , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis , are present .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ la@@ sis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given concur@@ r@@ ently with pharmaceuticals that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 iso@@ cy@@ te 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly mixed with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the low plasma levels caused by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels are and , if possible , to check the viral load and susp@@ end St. John &apos;s Wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases , whereas C@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was performed for the use of as@@ generic ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ cal component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and ag@@ asy are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adaptation is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs are to be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
when these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as the exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of 700 mg of f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without concur@@ rent application of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions with A@@ gener@@ ase .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these drugs if used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can cause resor@@ ption problems .
simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enz@@ ym@@ ers ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can cause a degradation of plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ thi@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pins , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by increasing the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous donation of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ est@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases of plasma levels are expected with simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma concentrations of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous injection of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , ag@@ asy must not be used along with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while caution is recommended while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ ate withdrawal symptoms , especially if at the same time low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , no recommendations can currently be given , such as the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose , when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dosing of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while A@@ gener@@ ase is administered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in people .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
further development of descendants , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurring early and rarely lead to treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1,@@ 200 mg of as@@ generic ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) occurring during the treatment are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and facial fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ din / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sticks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study we performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s in 24@@ 1 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over an average duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to stop treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ la@@ sis were reported especially in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in PI Pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low dose si@@ ster@@ one ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable .
in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures to be taken .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral ga@@ g and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ protein stages with the result of a formation of non @-@ infectious , non @-@ infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients with currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described rarely have been observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 included patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors demonstrated resistance patterns similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , L@@ 33@@ F , E@@ 34@@ Q , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 50@@ V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / T / V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 trial and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease @-@ inhibit@@ ing isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as decreased likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease @-@ inhibit@@ ing isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with decreased sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross @-@ resistance to rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data concerning cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients , in which a F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus @-@ containing pattern failed ( one of them pointed to a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a sa@@ wing therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which patients treated with PI ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care ( SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly associated with low @-@ d@@ osed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ le@@ thal threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached as@@ generic ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV infected children between 2 and 18 years of age , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies as@@ generic ase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks about 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on these data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ asy should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increases , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , where the amount of in@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , is likely to remain unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ent varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with caution when administered simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is of the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without concur@@ rent k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , who correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dosage of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeu@@ tical applications , showed little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse @-@ mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes were neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
previously , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated from 4 days of age showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus atro@@ phy and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , indicating a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the enhancing addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of ag@@ asy ( 1200 mg twice a day ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For certain medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , whereas C@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
when these drugs are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as the exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half the recommended dose 31 although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ thi@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pins , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , Nim@@ odi@@ pine , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother versus the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary supporting measures to be taken .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; un@@ born &quot; ag@@ asy should be taken into consideration when optimi@@ zing the treatment of pre @-@ treated children .
while the absolute concentration of in@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ent varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with caution when administered simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas oc@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dosage of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas was not yet clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , however , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse @-@ mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes were neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated from 4 days of age showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that in juven@@ iles the metabolism tract is not yet fully developed , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) are not yet fully developed .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years .
the benefit of patients treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution was neither demonstrated nor demonstrated in patients with PI .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight 3 times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation is required for the simultaneous use of a@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low @-@ dose ri@@ de@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side @-@ effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the active substance concentration .
ag@@ asy should be stopped in the long run if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in h@@ ep@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in hem@@ at@@ omas , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis , are present .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , whereas C@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and result in related side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data of 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for the human being is not known . a@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the pro@@ w@@ l gly@@ co@@ l contained in pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in people .
a reproduction study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients with currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described rarely have been observed .
the early departure of a sa@@ wing 60 therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on these data , the anticipated benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ag@@ asy should be considered in the improvement of therapy with PI @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large volume of Vet@@ ei@@ streams as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the frequency of application and the duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times a week for six weeks . • With ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses , it is repeated three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of pause between the treatment cycles .
the cream can be dil@@ uted before bed@@ time to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo experienced either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies to a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • The total recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream continues until all visible genital or peri@@ anal@@ ges@@ ia have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .

in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ eman@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and a case with one to the circumc@@ ision of leading stri@@ k@@ tur .
for an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed under proper use , which have necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream immediately following a treatment with other sub@@ cut@@ aneous methods for the treatment of external inclin@@ ations in the genital and peri@@ anal@@ ges@@ ia are not yet clinical experience .
limited data suggests an increased rate of inclin@@ ation for HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream has shown less efficacy in this group of patients regarding the elimination of inclin@@ ation .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of treatment .
as there is currently no data available on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapies for bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas should be considered .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the use of previously untreated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less chance of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip .
there are only very limited data on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ oses in anatom@@ ic areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis on the under@@ arms and hands do not support the efficacy of this application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after dis@@ continuing treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed less complete healing rates than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not show direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , mat@@ ernity or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .

the most commonly shared and probably or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the field of treatment of inclin@@ ations ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most frequently reported and most likely or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include discomfort on the site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine and placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials reported side effects are shown below .
the most common adverse reactions in these studies were a response to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine ) in these studies .
adverse events reported from 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine @-@ Cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ opla@@ sty are listed below .
the assessment of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , it is common to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , exc@@ itation / sk@@ ew@@ ing ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe scar@@ ring and destruction ( 19 % ) occurred .
in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental one @-@ time oral recording of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side @-@ effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were observed after topical i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine application .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a full healing of the inclin@@ ations in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment .
in 60 % of the total of 119 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patient was fully cured ; this was the case of 20 % of the patients who treated placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete recovery was achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine at five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that they remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine at three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acne les@@ ions within a related 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications external inclin@@ ations , ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis and super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the doses studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or ≤ 16 weeks ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis was observed in the three @-@ week application for 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were measured in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine resor@@ ption was low after topical application to MC @-@ affected skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ opla@@ sty or super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study on der@@ mal application conducted for four months showed no similar effects with the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days per week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , it is a risk for humans due to systemic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , ag@@ grav@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other heredi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization devices , and patients may require appropriate medicines prior to the administration in order to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study evaluated the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was measured ( by examining its effect in terms of reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by around 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients aged over 5 years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion body .
very common side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a meas@@ ur@@ ment of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to larv@@ ae id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information potentially disclosed each year and where necessary to update this summary whenever necessary .

the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been as@@ cer@@ tained , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been identified , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me &apos;s in@@ fusion should only be performed in an appropriate clinical environment where medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study we expect almost all Ig@@ G antibodies to form against larv@@ ae , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ induced responses must be treated with care when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of the treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously preceded by the theore@@ tically elevated risk of an over@@ sensitivity reaction .
pre@@ treat 60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ trac@@ ts ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .

four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or decrease of G@@ AG@@ s in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ atum and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms each week ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and sal@@ inity to the placebo group which is shown in the table below .
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage FE@@ V to be expected is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the size of the children growing .
of the 26 patients with H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous manifestation of the disease between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( mean percentage of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe failure form and 4 with the medium @-@ run form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - mirror in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were noted after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group . the younger patients with the severe course of circulation had a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe decline only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to those with older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with one @-@ time gift , toxic@@ ity with repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma In@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • First determine the number of perfor@@ ation bottles to be dil@@ uted according to the body weight of the individual patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not yet been treated in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
to reduce side effects , patients should have a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( remedy against vom@@ iting ) and fluids should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood picture changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ etal mixed s@@ lows the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural therapy , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) in 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9,@@ 3 months for the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared with 7,@@ 9 months compared to doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta compared to the comparison medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
every water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the appropriate volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predomin@@ ant plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for pre@@ valent dis@@ mal hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500@@ mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Gift as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the duration of treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) a week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a full blood picture should be created before each application , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients have to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC level 2 hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge .
if patients with non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity develop ≥ level 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be termin@@ ated if a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ re@@ duk@@ ti@@ o- or so@@ - fort the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies did not reveal that in patients aged 65 years of age or over 65 years of age , an increased risk of adverse side effects was reduced .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adap@@ tations were needed in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper bor@@ rowing coefficient and / or tran@@ shipment values of &gt; 3.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to disease progression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy number , plat@@ el@@ et number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of the degree of 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observ@@ able if pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous use of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ gi@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds for at least 5 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had identified risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes .
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials involving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , when this compound was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible pe@@ eling of the reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment g@@ inn to obtain advice on the preservation of sperm .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ ci@@ d ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can result in reduced P@@ em@@ etal loss with the result of increased incidence of side effects .
therefore caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in high doses for patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min . 2 days after the treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed can be avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) .
as there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed can be avoided .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected for an application in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice on the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ etal mixed into breast milk exceeds and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .

clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to the combined results of three P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ Mono@@ therap@@ i@@ studies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) in phase 2 , with the exception of neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase of al@@ anine ( 15.@@ 2 % versus 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre@@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .

from clinical studies , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported in patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy were reported ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic antibody that exercises its effect by interrup@@ ting weight @-@ like fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple attack points by blocking thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cine am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in- and purple nucle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin treated patients had a clin@@ ically significant advantage over survival compared to those patients who were only treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) associated with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the single c@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted from improving lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open Phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after chemotherapy followed a medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival in the benefit of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ re@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , matched HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ation ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and do not receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , causing approximately a quarter of the fats that have been added to the diet un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed from the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I of 25 to 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received 60 m@@ g. of all@@ i had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on after , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ cco , stool , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , branch o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( f@@ eces ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) , and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ically , fat @-@ induced diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and young people under the age of 18 since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , since or@@ list@@ at is resor@@ bed to minimal resor@@ ption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
as weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti @-@ diabe@@ tic should be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional anti @-@ contrac@@ eption measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed in both a study on drug interactions and in several cases with concur@@ rent or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants combined with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( International Standard R@@ atio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplement of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a minor decrease in the am@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed for a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies did not show direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal and related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the incidence of known side effects noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may result in anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported cases , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of possible systemic effects deri@@ ving from or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ gible properties can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect is applied in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active Ser@@ in remainder of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pi@@ ds .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ ory , fat @-@ induced diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight during study course ( Table 1 ) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ c and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study involving obes@@ e patients who were given the minimal systemic resor@@ b@@ ated dose , two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after separation of the N @-@ mol@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine group ) could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of total plastic concentrations .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot be identified with any particular danger to humans .
pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system The owner of the permit for the transport must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system , as described in the July 2007 version as in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market .

to get used to your body &apos;s new eating habits , start with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ induced diet before the first capsule is taken .
food items are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits .
in order to achieve your target weight safely , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Re@@ p o@@ ily to reduce the likel@@ ihood of food @-@ related side effects ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before starting your capsules .
remember to consult your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical exercise . • Sta@@ y while taking and also after taking all@@ i physically active .
• Al@@ i may not be taken for more than 6 months . • If after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i no reduction of your weight can be detected , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may need to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not a matter of changing the diet for a short time and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than one hour since the last meal has passed , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour since the last meal has passed , do not take any capsule .
flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without o@@ ily res@@ ignation , sudden or increased bow@@ el movement and soft chair ) can be attributed to the mechanism of action ( see section 1 ) .
severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions can be seen in the following changes : severe short@@ ness of breath , swe@@ ating out@@ breaks , skin rash , it@@ ching , swelling in the face , heart ras@@ ps , circul@@ atory collapse .
29 Very common side effects These can occur in more than 1 out of 10 people who take all@@ i . • P@@ air@@ ing ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) with and without o@@ ily leaving • Su@@ dden chair • Su@@ dden chair inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of these side effects is ampli@@ fied or significantly impaired .
frequent side effects These can occur in 1 out of 10 people who take all@@ i . • In@@ contin@@ ence ( stool ) • wat@@ ery / liquid stool • In@@ contin@@ ence • If any of these side effects increases or significantly affects you .
effects on blood tests It is not known how often these effects occur . • In@@ cre@@ asing certain liver enzyme levels • In@@ cre@@ asing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients taking War@@ far@@ in or other blood dil@@ uting ( anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulating ) drugs .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you notice significantly affects you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased ex@@ cre@@ tion of fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment , because at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize diet @-@ related side effects : • Beg@@ ins already a few days , or better a week , before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced nutrition . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you exceeding your fat limit decreases . • In@@ cre@@ ase your recommended amount of fat evenly to the daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial after@@ table as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Ke@@ ep out of use after the exp@@ iry date specified on the cart@@ on . • Ke@@ ep tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two sealed sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
• Do not swallow this medication . • You can take your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this package .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hypertension • Diabetes • Heart disease • Stro@@ ke • Cer@@ tain cancer • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
lasting weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les that you will also find as an indication of food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
the recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
the quantity required for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fats , you can maxim@@ ise weight loss and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg a week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low Physi@@ cal Activity &quot; means that you do not walk a little or no longer , climb stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium @-@ level physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal per day , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minutes of gardening , or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a long @-@ term weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Essen@@ tial is a nutrition journal with information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before starting with all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutrition plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat du@@ ps and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you develop healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate causes for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong cause of nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi across the European Union to the Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for preventing nausea and vom@@ iting induced by strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should neither be used for prevention nor treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five investigated chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral Met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not exist , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events associated with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least potentially associated with Alo@@ xi , were a headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; no dose @-@ effect relationships were observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 m@@ g. of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients receiving highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m ² c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , given intraven@@ ously in day 1 .
results of the study with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy were combined in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of p@@ alli@@ ative Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable with the value measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the dispos@@ able dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous jun@@ c@@ tival injection the total body temperature was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only by ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficiently over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given every day for over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and because Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time use in humans , the relevance of these results is low compared to humans .
the holder of this permit for the placing of the commission must inform the European Commission on the plans for the placing of the medicine approved within the framework of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report recommen@@ ding the approval of the approval of the Medic@@ ines Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of hepatitis C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicine called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same drug that has already been approved in the EU ( also referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic investigation , the liver tissue damages the liver tissue ; furthermore , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ in- Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are norm@@ alized in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy of hepatitis C ) .
in the hepatitis C study , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after adjustment of the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ business purposes only provided the CH@@ MP has prompted the refer@@ ral to prohi@@ bit the marketing ?
in addition , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting up with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was reduced to more patients than with the reference medical drug , and Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition to this , the test used in the study to investigate whether the drug will respond to an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ ations ( cra@@ cking or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for treatment of infections proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ arms may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the area to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby hin@@ ders the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients suffering from placebo responded to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin findings , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together with skin findings , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it has been found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the place of application .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ations , abra@@ sions or stit@@ ched wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a permit to introduce Al@@ tar@@ go to the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of raising awareness or serious local irritation due to the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection can be commen@@ ced .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not meant to be used for the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary open wounds , the efficacy of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ination in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was inadequate .
alternative therapy should be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected area occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ in- and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo cannot be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the average re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin of healthy adult men increased 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity according to oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement affecting the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy , if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the baby and the benefit of the al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which were used by Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect irritation occurred at the administration of approximately 1 % of the patients .
mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic Deri@@ v@@ ate of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase center .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking P @-@ binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin seem question@@ able on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance to at least some Inf@@ ection Mol@@ ds , a consultation should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to respond to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains should be considered with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 shiel@@ ded skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) performed over 14 days there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid les@@ ions .
in vitro analysis on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rats micro@@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats indications of reduced fertility for oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby an up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sh@@ ear@@ ed skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study in rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( see above ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was established .

ambient rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years of age , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , and it may only be possible to protect hepatitis B after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation and ensuring that the vacc@@ ination plan existing in two doses can be termin@@ ated .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act by helping the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural defense ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogn@@ ises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ ination for vacc@@ ines that have been approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination for vacc@@ ines that have been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ et adults and Twin@@ et children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ et adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ et adults have also been used as evidence of the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix initiated a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue , and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals company to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ me@@ tization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vacc@@ ines , with the first dose being given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose between six and twelve months .
if a boo@@ ster vaccine is required for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody values are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent individuals who have responded to a hepatitis C vaccine need a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even if antibodies are no longer det@@ ectable .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the injection of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels , so that the administration of further doses can be required in these cases .
since intra@@ muscular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal imm@@ ac@@ ulate result , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood co@@ agulation disorders , however , it may be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular injection .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined mass m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must assume that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ability , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of the Ambi@@ rix vaccine were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations aged 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the tolerance of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ability on a calculation basis per vaccine dose , but not on a basis for calculation per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the entire vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received the ambi@@ light reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated using the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ability was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to those observed when administered with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines , which reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ines with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , anti @-@ HA@@ V serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s conversion rates were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose administered for month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month of 2 and 6 after administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study from 1 to 11 year @-@ olds a month after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the table below .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ologic response observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the in the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered at the same time as a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as by bathing in waters contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus before the two vacc@@ ines are administered ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections affecting the liver or causing symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin rash , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of your face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of an vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before ending the vaccine series .
sometimes your child will suffer from severe bleeding disturbances , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s own defence , or if you / her child will undergo a ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambi@@ ente can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child will take other medicines ( including those you can receive without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has been given / has been given or has been planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambition , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible .
when ambi@@ ente is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually , ambition will not be given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is highly necessary to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 im@@ pover@@ ished doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • headaches • L@@ oss of appetite
allergy suffer@@ ers ( up to 1 case per 10 im@@ pover@@ ished doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Inten@@ sive • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal discomfort
other adverse events reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 mis@@ used doses ) are :
these include loc@@ alized or extended lap@@ els that can be it@@ chy or infl@@ amed , swelling of the eye area and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and loss of consciousness .
flu @-@ like symptoms , including ch@@ ills , muscular and joint pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , mis@@ percep@@ tions such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , nervous disorders , loss of sensation or mobility of some body parts , severe headaches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions
fain@@ ting inflammation of some blood vessels causes nausea or disease , loss of appetite , diar@@ rhe@@ a and abdominal pain . lymp@@ h node swelling increases tendency to bleeding or bru@@ ising ( bru@@ ises ) caused by the amount of blood plat@@ el@@ ets .
23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects listed above you / your child is significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data that has been known since the first approval was granted for the placing of the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix will remain positive .
however , since Am@@ rix was brought into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme failure or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( cereb@@ ral damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed into the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
there was no comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo treatment , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste eases , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the CH@@ MP ( CH@@ MP ) Committee concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle has effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this drug was presented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested itself in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ al form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ f@@ al deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma formation .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate via the liver and kidneys takes place , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve les@@ ions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted to the breast milk in humans , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10@@ g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity for intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an met@@ abo@@ lically active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl concentration of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for every gram .
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ anti@@ st , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of ex@@ cre@@ tion of nitrogen ( sodium chlori@@ de , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post @-@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the onset of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ Tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ dy@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible and in some patients a further worsen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is enz@@ ym@@ atic con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were found 15 minutes after the intake .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disturbances or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was no acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after the next morning .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentrations were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medicine is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat did not have any compla@@ ined effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( study 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot yet swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or through a gastro@@ stom@@ y or nas@@ al probe .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ f@@ al deficiency of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl concentration of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for every gram .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further worsen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were found 15 minutes after the intake .
during durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
this procedure contains a small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the toxic waste products which accumulate after the consumption of proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if they are not prescription drugs .
during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , ob@@ struction of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disturbances and a worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

• Take from the tank a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Place a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the knife spoon , to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of measuring sco@@ op gran@@ ules from the container .
angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for instance with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stem elevation &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measure of the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients with a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ ic in case of any gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , patients were frequently employed ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as dep@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox@@ - with or without administration of G@@ PI was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox@@ in relation to all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox@@ in may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ant , other Hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who have recently been bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or serious kidney problems or a heart infection .
the CH@@ MP ( CH@@ MP ) Committee reached the conclusion that angi@@ ox@@ in the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the transfer of angi@@ ox@@ ins across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ raising inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous per@@ fusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in a further sequence , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI I can resume the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure a bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox@@ in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ us of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a certain bol@@ us @-@ administration of angi@@ ox@@ ic was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before the application and the recommended dose is quickly given intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT atta@@ ches value to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ ant against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , it is possible to admini@@ ster a second nut dose of 0.3 mg / kg and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which were included for approval , the ACT atta@@ ches 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular lifting .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active ble@@ ed@@ ings or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if most of the ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur in patients with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur during treatment in principle throughout all kinds of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after finishing the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din can once again reach the level prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) it can be assumed that these drugs increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored .
animal experimental studies are insufficient in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , mat@@ ernity or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ant alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women and patients over the age of 65 compared to male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding , as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both mild and severe bleeding performed significantly less often than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well known point of bleeding , Re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose and neck .
the following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ant in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women and patients over the age of 65 compared to male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in table 6 .
in the case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ant must be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ant , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion @-@ ind@@ entation region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ mb@@ ine is in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din on Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , in turn , slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with serum from patients with which in the past had come to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation response .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose and conc@@ entri@@ c anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the following cases , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ant@@ ine should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ raising inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or on the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were equally distributed across the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent an angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin L@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin delivery .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % on human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to is@@ lan@@ is@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH an approval for the transfer of A@@ pi@@ dra to the European Union .
as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ium through continuous in@@ fusion into the abdominal area .
due to reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with reduced liver function .
any change in the active force , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can cause a change in the insulin requirements .
3 . insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
switching from one patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when switching to the treatment scheme .
these include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics like beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and spare pin the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ co@@ g@@ ulation can be weakened or missing .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between intra@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in the human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application .
listed below are listed un@@ desirable medications known from clinical studies , group@@ ed by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to continuously change the injection point within the injection unit , subsequently a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection point .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
following an injection of glucose , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the activity occurs faster and the duration of the activity is shorter than with normal levels of normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male subjects aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ ing effect , and 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase in glu@@ cos@@ ing effect , just like human insulin .
insulin L@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves complete glu@@ cos@@ ing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post den@@ oun@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin was hei@@ gh@@ tened 2 minutes before the meal , a better post den@@ oun@@ cement than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was achieved .
if insulin is applied 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ des before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) , is achieved .
insulin L@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) as well as in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal in comparison to human normal @-@ acting insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
