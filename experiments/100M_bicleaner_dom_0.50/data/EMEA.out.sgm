<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirling thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness whereby the patients have alternating with periods of normal sentiment.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to insert or use the glaze tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time, which are broken down in the same way as Abilify, the dose should be adapted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to communicate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably acts primarily as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent, acts as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, whereby psychotic or manic symptoms are reduced and their reoccurrence is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients where the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, with which of Loracepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the changes in the patient's symptoms were investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution to intake (records).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg significantly reduced the symptoms of increased unrest compared to those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented even up to 74 weeks of efficacy in placebo to restore manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo as the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Loracepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled), acathic (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (drowsiness), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbance) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disruption as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke mostly in manic episodes and in which the manic episodes were addressed to the treatment with Aripiprazole compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the advantages of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disruption, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the market launch of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes of the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, once a day, regardless of the meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of the meals used as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an antipsychotic medication, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that there was no elevated level of suicidal risk associated with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics in patients with bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypothalemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerified and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia, occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If there are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia in the patients treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to undesired cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with etoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events associated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsie, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central acting drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107%, while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' metabolizing, the common application with high-acting inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint offering of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefit should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteasinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem (or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate rise in aripiprazole concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethyst / 3-methoxymorphine-ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omebozol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy because of the insufficient data situation for humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies of the animal unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole decreased overall lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients with Olanzine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients with aripiprazole and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those of lithium.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters were observed, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphate kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Among the side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic medication, and also reported in treatment with Aripiprazole, include the Maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch unintentional or deliberate overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that haemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D-2 and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to dopamine D, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergigen and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In doses of 0.5 to 30 mg. a day more than 2 weeks in healthy volunteers the positron-emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the Nucleus caudatus and the Putstream.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the proportion of responder patients, who held a response to study medication, was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher rate of return, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dose over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I-disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies lasting 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or semi-operidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania in week 12, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase prior to randomization, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo regarding the prevention of bipolar relapse, predominantly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripiprazole, the N dealkyation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average Eliminationary period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole for extensive metabolisizers over CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours at bad 'poor' metabolisizers over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="91">A Populations-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences regarding the ethnicity or impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional safety-harmacology studies, toxicity with repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects encompassed a dose-dependent peripheral toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of Aripiprazole Hydroxy- Metabolites in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral exposure from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average Steady State Exposition (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the 3- and 11-times of the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, treatment should be terminated with Aripiprazole injection solution and started using the oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and to minimise variability, an injection in the delta muscle or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by circumventing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acutely treatment (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the features of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with behavioural and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, the patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure loss (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alcohol- or drug poisoning (prescribed or illicit drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypothalemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerified and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia, occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of MNS include high fever, stiffness, alternating states of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsie, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally seen in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to the one-time injection of Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) as one-time intramuscularly study and, at the same time, received lauzepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In contrast to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolism, CYP2D6 'poor' metabolisizers can result in the common use of high-acting inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV- proteasinhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After placing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose level before the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Loracepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that after the sole gift of Aripiprazole.</seg>

<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients with aripiprazole and 17.6% for those of lithium.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase for 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18,2% for patients with Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters were observed, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (Creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Among the side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic medication, and also reported in treatment with Aripiprazole, include the Maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant greater improvements in aptoxicity / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as astigating and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms regarding aptoxicity and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Loracepame reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean recovery from baseline on PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour junction was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Loracepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aptoxicity, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the proportion of responder patients, who held a response to study medication, was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study goals including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher return rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target was' weight gain ', an increase of at least 5.6 kg (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) occurred with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy was found to reduce manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 week extension in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo regarding the prevention of bipolar relapse, predominantly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazole AUC is 90% greater in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazole injections was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- and 5 times above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity according to intravenous application no safety-related concerns arose according to maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated application, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in doses or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent peripheral toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised before treatment via a sperm count, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (often), which can affect the perspiration and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important cases of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagy, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, pain in the gum, loose stool, esophagitis, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, muscle spasms, muscle spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, muscle spasms, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency were possible and no causal connection was established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an enhancement microtubules active ingredient that promotes the coagulation of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilises the microtubules by blocking their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel into the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved trance-dothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminrezeptor and due to the albumin protein SPARC (sected protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-armed unfaded studies and 454 patients who were treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg. / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel within 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 minute infusion without premeditation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of the patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastazation and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity towards paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">Due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses, the natural course of peripheral neuropathy after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were evaluated in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Active agent exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous treatment of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extra-vascular distribution and / or soft tissue binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">Paclitaxel in paclitaxel was higher (43%) after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume of Abraxane was higher (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine separation was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients over the age of 75, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Education brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labeling and packaging. • With clear visual representation of the correct use of the product, provided cooling boxes for transport by the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Absecamed is a biological medicinal product approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also referred to as "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron values, in which complications could occur in connection with a blood transfusion if a blood-blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with conditions for which the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients suffering from kidney problems and patients who want to make their own blood donation, Absamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injections may also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be administered during the whole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients suffering from kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by anthropoietal deficiency or because the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was incorporated into the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with the reference medical drug when injected into a vein as part of a major study with 479 patients who suffered from anemia due to kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Absamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study examining the effects of bottomamed bottomamed with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients treated to Absamed have been maintained in the same degree as those who continue to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which occasionally leads to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The CHMP Committee for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in accordance with the regulations of the European Union the evidence has been proved that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile, such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces abseamed will provide information packages for the medical staff in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co KG to approve the placing of abseamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiplem myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia in the onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency), if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, in case of larger surgical procedures requiring large blood volume (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">To reduce debt levels, Absamed can be used before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml, which cannot take part in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except pediatric patients where the hemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this haemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest approved dose which is necessary for the control of anaemia and anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical findings suggest that patients with an initial low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with an initial low hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using an intravenous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms and symptoms can vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this haemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest approved dose, which is required for the control of anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of hemoglobin value increased by at least 1 g / dl (0,62 mmol / l) or the reaction number to ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reaction number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl have risen to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the hemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the Retikuloid number has increased by ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l), the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the Retikulocyte number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin alfa drugs is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, abseamed should be obtained twice a week for 3 weeks before operative intervention in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program begins, so that large iron reserves are available prior to the commencement of the abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of the procedure (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days, on the day of the procedure and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients diagnosed with any erythropoietin (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive any abseamed or other erythropoietin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastoenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within a month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">The use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients suffering from a larger elective orthopaedic surgery: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently frozen heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoia (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti-body-mediated PRCA after months of months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction of hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium oxide oxidation, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reciprocity value, considering anaemia (i.e. the "index"), is low (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of a loss of activity is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be detected and an examination of the bone marrow for diagnosing a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk of anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulant active substances (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit, which is attributable to the administration of epoetins, when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration required for control of anaemia symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evidenced coronary heart disease or congestion insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumor patients under chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of epoetin alfa (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2, to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2) to hold the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible prior to the onset of epoetin alfa drugs the cause of anaemia should be investigated and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing large elective orthopaedics should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events may arise.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetins have not demonstrated that they can improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy after haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be checked and the Ciclosporine dose can be adjusted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Over thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhasis, cerebral infarction), vascular thromboses, aneurysm, retinal vein thrombosis, aneurysm, retinal vein thrombosis, aneurysm, retinal vein thrombosis and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, there may be thrombotic and vascular complications in the case of surgical patients with cardiovascular disease following repeated blood donations.</seg>

<seg id="439">In the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin and the control patients.</seg>
<seg id="440">In these studies, patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin showed an anaemia more consistent with an anemia due to a variety of common malignancies, significantly higher mortality than in controls.</seg>
<seg id="441">Overall survival in studies could not be explained satisfactorily by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoetin.</seg>

<seg id="529">An updated RMP should be provided at the same time as the next updated report on the safety of the drug (Periodic Safety Update Report, PSUR) according to the "CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use."</seg>
<seg id="530">In addition, an updated RMP should be submitted: • receiving new information that could affect the current safety specifications (Safety Specification), the pharmacovigilance plan or the measures for risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching an important (pharmacovigilance or risk reduction) milestones • following a request by the EMEA</seg>
<seg id="531">• During a month prior to your treatment, have suffered a heart attack or a stroke • if you suffer from unstable angina pectoris (for the first time or reinforced chest pain), there is a risk of blood clots occurring in veins (deep vein thrombosis) - if, for example, such a drop of blood has occurred to you earlier.</seg>
<seg id="532">You suffer from severe circulatory disorders of the heart (coronary heart disease), arteries of the legs or arms (peripheral arterial occlusion), the neck vessels (vascular disease of the carotides) or of the brain (cerebrovascular disease) you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="533">During the treatment with abseamed, there can be a slight dose-dependent rise in the number of platelets within the normal range, which is reformed during further treatment.</seg>
<seg id="534">Your doctor will, if necessary, conduct regular blood tests to regularly check the number of platelets during the first 8 weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="535">Iron deficiency, the elimination of red blood cells (hemolysis), blood loss, vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with abseamed before the onset of the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="536">Very rare was reported about the occurrence of anthroblastoconia after months to years of treatment with subcutaneous (under the skin speckled) erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="537">If you suffer from erythroblasting, it will break down your therapy with abseamed and determine how your anaemia is best treated.</seg>
<seg id="538">Therefore, Absamed must be given by injection into a vein (intravenous) if you are treated for anaemia due to kidney disease.</seg>
<seg id="539">A high haemoglobin value could be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased.</seg>
<seg id="540">In case of elevated or increasing potassium levels, your doctor may consider an interruption of the treatment with Absamed until the potassium levels are back to normal.</seg>
<seg id="541">If you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clinically obvious coronary heart disease or congestion mark by inadequate heart rate, your doctor will make sure that your haemoglobin mirror does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="542">According to the findings, the treatment of anaemia with abseamed in adults with chronic kidney failure (renal insufficiency), which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="543">A 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of Absamed.</seg>
<seg id="544">Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dye (hemoglobin) and adjust your abseamed dose to minimize the risk of blood clots (thrombotic event) as low as possible.</seg>
<seg id="545">This risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the advantages derived from the treatment with epoetin alfa, especially if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e.g. when obese or obese vascular events have occurred (e.g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolia).</seg>
<seg id="546">If you are a cancer patient, keep in mind that Absamed acts as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="547">If you have a major orthopaedic surgery, the cause of your anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly before the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="548">If your values of the red blood dye (hemoglobin) are too high, you should not receive Absamed because there is an increased risk of blood clots after surgery.</seg>
<seg id="549">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="550">If you take Ciclosporin (means to suppress the immune system) during your therapy with abseamed, your doctor may need certain blood tests to measure the blood level of Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="551">Laboratory studies have shown no interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM CSF (G-CSF and GM CSF are a means to build up the immune system, for example for cancer chemotherapy or HIV).</seg>
<seg id="552">Depending on how your anaemia (anaemia) responds to treatment, the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to ensure the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your hemoglobin value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well adjusted, you will receive regular doses of ablaamed between 25 and 50 I.U. / kg twice a week, distributed to two equally large injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor will, if necessary, arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and ensure that your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="556">Depending on how anaemia will respond to treatment, the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="557">To make sure that the hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value, the doctor in charge will conduct regular blood tests.</seg>
<seg id="558">If it is necessary to shorten treatment time before surgery, a dose of 300 I.U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery, on the day of the operation and another 4 days after surgery.</seg>
<seg id="559">However, if your doctor considers this appropriate, you can also learn how to spill Absamed yourself under the skin.</seg>
<seg id="560">Heart, heart attacks, cerebral haemorrhages, stroke, temporary circulatory disorders of the brain, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thromboses, arterial thromboses, retinal vessels and blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from erythropoetin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="561">Eyelids and lips (Quincke-edema) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms such as tingling, redness, itching, feeling of heat and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases.</seg>
<seg id="562">Erythroblastoma means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone marrow (see section "Special care when using abseamed").</seg>
<seg id="563">After repeated blood donations it can occur - regardless of the treatment with abseamed - to a thrombotic vascular event.</seg>
<seg id="564">Abseamed treatment can be associated with increased risk of haemorrhage after surgery (post-operative thrombotic vascular events) if your initial hemoglobin value is too high</seg>
<seg id="565">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the mentioned side effects are significantly impaired or if you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>

<seg id="567">Aclasta is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease that makes the bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high risk of fracture (bone fractures), including those who have recently suffered a low-traumatic hip fracture such as Hinfall; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment; patients with hip fractures should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) oral or through injection into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of acetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclasta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the infusion, such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">To treat Paget's disease, Aclasta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease.</seg>
<seg id="572">Since the active ingredient in Aclasta is the same as in Zometa, a portion of the data material for Zometa was used to evaluate Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="573">In the first study, nearly 8,000 elderly women with osteoporosis were involved, and the number of spinal and hip fractures over a period of three years was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years, who recently had a hip fracture; the number of fractures has been studied over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget Aclasta was tested in two studies to 357 patients and compared six months with Risedronate (another bisphosphonate).</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in the serum (an enzyme that builds bone substance) normalized in the blood or decreased by at least 75% compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients with Aclasta (without any other osteoporosis) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to those of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients taking Aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fractures 9% of the patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days of infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Zoledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are exposed to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteonecarse (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Aclasta manufacturer provides information material for doctors who prescribe Aclasta to treat osteoporosis, which provides information on how to use the medicine, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to Novartis Europharm Limited for the transfer of Aclasta across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Supplement supplement • contraindication in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently declassed low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg of aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">Patients with low-traumatic hip fractures are recommended to administer the infusion of Aclasta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After the treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable for patients with Morbus Paget sufficient supply of calcium, twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">Patients with a recently declassified low-traumatic hip fracture recommend an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscular vitamin D before the first aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of acetamol may be reduced shortly after using acetamol or ibuprofen following the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with renal dysfunction (see Section 4.4) In patients with a Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as there are limited clinical experience for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) are not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, as data concerning safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because there are limited clinical experience for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D before starting therapy with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Zoledronic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days following the infusion of aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable for patients with Morbus Paget sufficient supply of calcium, twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene) should be examined before applying bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental surgery, no data is available, whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acetamol can be reduced shortly after using acetamol or ibuprofen following the application of acetamol (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of adverse events reported by atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture trial [RFT]), the total frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid was associated with renal function disorders, which were associated as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase of serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Creatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were in a clinical study of osteoporosis comparable to the Aclasta- and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatinins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of laboratory findings, the transient asymptomatic calcium values that were below the normal range (less than 2.10 mmol / l) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplemental sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study to avoid clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of acetlasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study reported local reactions to the infusion body, such as redness, swelling and / or pain reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area was reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area) which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Patients with 7,736 patients showed osteonecsis in the jaw area in a patient treated with Aclasta and placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, an equilibrium may be obtained by offering oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once per year for 3 consecutive years was shown with either a bone density (BMD) T-Score for the Schenkelhal ≤ -2.5 with or without any signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or several new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta treated patients aged 75 years and over had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed an equally lasting effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures in one around 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar fluoric acid, hips and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the lumbar spine increased by 6.7%, total hips by 6.0%, the thigh by 5.1% and distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 of postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic sludge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase of the trabecular bone volume compared with placebo and the receipt of trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in the serum and the beta-C-telescopeptide (b-CTx) in the serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during the duration of study.</seg>
<seg id="630">The treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP by 30% compared to the initial value and was kept at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased BMD at all time points compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">In comparison to placebo treatment, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% to the overall workforce and 4.3% at the Schenkelhal.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% compared to 8.7% in placebo-treated men.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (CZOL446M2308), the once-yearly administration of Aclasta compared to the once-weekly dose of alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebra BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was studied to patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2.6x to 3.0x age-specific upper normal value in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledronic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of Risedronate once a day for 2 months was shown in two months of comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and analgesia was observed after 6 months compared to baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month study (response to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">The 143 with Aclasta and 107 with Risedronate treated patients who participated in the follow-up study were able to maintain the therapeutic response at 141 of the patients treated with acetronate, compared with 71 of the patients treated with Risedronate, in a mean duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearing from the big cycle with half-life time t ½ -α 0,24 and t ½ -1.87 hours, followed by a long eliminatory phase with a terminal eliminatory period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the mentioned t ½ -values) represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total-body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized substances metabolized by Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible drug-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinin Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction to a Kreatinin Clearance up to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the cioledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe renal dysfunction (Kreatinin Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data is available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal-acting intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In trials involving dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous use, the renal tolerance of zoledronic acid in rats was determined by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15 minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose equivalent to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in cumulated expositions that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects on other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, and the intravenous injection site occurred.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common approach in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an finding that reflects the pharmacological, anafibrillative effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">At rats one observed a teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was marked with 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low Serum calcium level.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time according to preparation and conditions before the application; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded.</seg>

<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens made of androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is structured randomly, making the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising bone reconstruction, ensuring a normal bone formation and thus reinforces the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">When using Aclasta with other medicines, please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs known to damage the kidneys.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest acceptable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl resin and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonylurea and insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, making type 2 diabetes more effective.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in tripletherapy; in doing so, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos has led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that the blood sugar levels have been reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, an additional 0.94% reduction in HbA1c values was added to the existing treatment with metformin and sulfonyl resin, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of acetone and insulin in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos in addition to insulin reported a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory infections (colds), weight gain and hypotheses (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos should not be used in patients who might be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the marketing of Actos throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and where metformin is inadequate due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under the age of 18, so the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of at least one risk factor (e.g. former heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, there was an increase in reports on heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated initial liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazon should be directed to the presence of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can stir from fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) occurred in the treatment with Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparing controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sulfonylurea or dual combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market introduction, a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thiazolid indions, including pioglitazone, a occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is not clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative treatment.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive Study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractions per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative treatment.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs, treatment must be deprecated (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetic or pharmaceuticals dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Drug interactions can be metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC from Pioglitazon by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the Pioglitazon AUC.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin resistance caused during pregnancy decreases and increased insulin resistance of the maternal animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000; rarely &lt; 1 / 10000, isolated cases: unknown (not estimated from present data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the lens and refraction index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic active substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone ALT ascents over three times the upper limit of the normal range were often similar to placebo, but less often than in comparison groups of metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure in Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazone or Pioglitazon respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market introduction it has rarely been reported about heart failure in Pioglitazon, but more often when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events related to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in patients treated with pioglitazon and more than 7,400 patients in the treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study running over a period of 3.5 years, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative treatment.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day for seven days did not present any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon appears to have activated specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ), which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose tolerance in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazon versus Gliclacide as monotherapy was carried out for over two years to investigate the time up to the follow up of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate in spite of three months of improvement phase with insulin were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with pioglitazone the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical studies over a year, a statistically significant decline in the albumin / creatinin ratio showed a consistently statistically significant decrease in the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was studied in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared with placebo, a reduction of total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol and a slightly but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol level were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced total plastic matrices and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazon, while values diminished under metformin and gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postnatal increased triglyceride levels, both of effect on triglycerid absorption and hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular diseases were randomized to groups who received either Pioglitazon or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the highest concentrations of immutable pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the triple of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic or pharmaceuticals dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive waste pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma reduction time of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anemia and recurrent excentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin resistance resulting in the gestation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the maternal animal and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the bladder epithelium was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolidal quinones led to increased frequency of colonic tumors.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative treatment.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive Study, a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractions per 100 patient years) of patients treated with Pioglitazon compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative treatment.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study for two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each pioglitazone or Gliclacide were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than one year, a statistically significant decline in the albumin / Kreatinin ratio showed a consistently statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin ratio compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon not only reduced the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postnatal increased triglyceride levels, which has an effect on Tryglyceride and hepatic Tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-mortal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary artery disease, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and revascularization of leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking Pioglitazon.</seg>

<seg id="877">Before travelling across multiple time zones, the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his physician as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">Therefore, the doctor must consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them.</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can, however, gradually develop: • Easy hypoglycemia can be treated by the oral intake of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugar-containing fruit juice. • Heavy hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an unseen aid or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum working time is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the duration of the activity lasts up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of split (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional safety-harmacology studies, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1222">Data from the open extension study in Phase 3 showed that the persistent lowering of serum levels of serum was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients needed treatment against rheumatism in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need treatment for a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout, which in 54% of patients had a complete disappearance of the toxicity up to 24 months.</seg>

<seg id="1289">• The patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcers. • Patients are not supposed to lie before the first intake of the day, which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract apart from pyloroplastic, should be given only under special caution (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by ophageal striktions, were reported in patients taking alendronate (some of them were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore alert attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible occludic reactions, and patients should be reminded when symptoms of occult irritations such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retroviral pain or new or deteriorating heartburn may reduce the drug and seek medical advice (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe esophageal side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue taking it after symptoms that point to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with Alendronat no increased risk was found, gastric and duodenal ulcera, among them some severe and with complications, were rarely reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecsis of the jaw, commonly associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen mainly administered intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There is no data available that indicates whether the removal of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteonecsis of the jaw.</seg>

<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture in postmenopausal women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) as well as in the Fraktur-Interventional Study (FIT: n = 6.459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In phase III trials, the moderate ascents of BMD with Alendronate amounted to 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the spine, 5.9% at the femur and 7.8% at the trochanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronate, a reduction of 48% (Alendronate 3.2% versus placebo 6.0%) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the ascents of the BMD of the spine and trochanter continued; also the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled studies where Alendronate was taken daily (5 mg. a day for 2 years and then 10 mg. a day, either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebrate score by 47% (Alendronate 7.9% compared to placebo 15.0%).</seg>

<seg id="1325">Bioavailability decreased correspondingly to about 0.46% and 0.39% if Alendronate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">Alendronate was effective in osteoporosis when it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times daily over five days) did not lead to clinically significant changes in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>

<seg id="1402">As tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already used in the EU, the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were presented to 668 patients with kidney transplant, compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a year of treatment (for example, by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further studies in 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant were conducted and investigated, as Advagraf is absorbed by the body in comparison to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1408">Patients and doctors must be careful when others (especially some herbal) drugs should be taken concurrently with Advagraf as the prescribed dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adapted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this drug or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this may lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including sub- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; formulations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adaptations must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of lawyer should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below) Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the tacrolimus surface levels should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Day 4 the systemic exposure, measured as a level mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the tacrolimus-level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate night-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a substance with low clearance, an adjustment of the one-dose can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1419">If the condition of the patient does not allow oral consumption of medicines during the first post-operative phase, the tacrolimus treatment can be initiated intravenously (Prograf 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an infusion solution) with a dose of ca.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Duration of the application To suppress the graft rejection, the immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be stated.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - renal transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advocacy therapy should start with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adaptations can be necessary later, as tacrolimus pharmacokinetics can change after transplantation in the course of stabilization of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral advocacy therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switch from Prograf to Advance must be converted from Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraph, so this conversion has to be done in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant after switching from other immunosuppressants to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose for the prophylaxis of graft rejection must begin with the oral initial dose recommended in both kidney and liver transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Cardiac transplantation An oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in adult patients who are converted to Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients Although there is no clinical experience with an oral, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patient, Prograf was used in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / day, in pankreast transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adaptations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood levels in the targeted area may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders to decrease the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Because the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum creatine levels, a calculation of the creatine learance and a monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of repulsion and tolerability in individual cases by means of full blood tacrolimus-level checks.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent checks of tacrolimus-levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advagraf, dose adaptation, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could alter the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the levels of the valley do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of tacrolimus in the whole blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects which may occur as a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage; formulations of the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be effective against other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the resardized formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In addition to prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult patients with heart transplants and graft recipients, there are no clinical data for the resardized formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions, which can lead to a reduction of tacrolim levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is to avoid any other herbal remedy during a treatment with adventiation (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea a particularly careful observation of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, as the tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, there was a known as cardiomyopathy called ventricular or septum-hypertrophy, which can therefore occur under Advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical abnormalities are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malignant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who are taking Tacrolimus symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and visual disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the tacrolimus blood levels while adding substances that can alter the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macromedia antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels was mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as is used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 Hemmer; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the clearing of steroid contraceptives, and thus increase the endocrine exposition, it is especially cautious when decisions on contraceptive measures are to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and Phenazon and extend its half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients have no indication that under tacrolimus compared to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, monitoring of the newborn is recommended for any harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be mediated by its binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell nucleus.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to the observations in the large studies where Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation An interim analysis of a recently conducted multicentre study of oral prograf has reported over 110 patients who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin within 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>

<seg id="1488">The number of cases where there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the tacrolimus Group patients (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicenter study of oral prograf was performed to 205 patients who simultaneously received pancreatic and kidney transplantation, which were randomized to receive tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by corticosteroids shall be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion occurs mainly through the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients, which were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to the full day dose (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) to the total daily dose, the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advance was approximately 10% lower than in Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital heart disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application is based on whether agents are used for the treatment of bleedings or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"" "Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as" "" "recombinant DNA technology" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Lawyer is similar to another in the European Union named Recombinate, but is made differently, so that the drug does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of advates in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new hemorrhages with "excellent" respectively "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or witch protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit to market lawyers across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the place and extent of the bleeding and the patient's clinical condition.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Repeat every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours for patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma crucible is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">In response to factor VIII, individual patients can differentiate themselves in vivo recovery and have different half-lives.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis The long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration speed should depend on the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, where the risk within the first 20 position days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure-days and amnestically known inhibitors development, switching from a recombinant factor VIII-product to another, the recurrence of (low-titrins) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, based on the ADVATE security profile, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP has decided that the authorisation holder shall apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited officially informed the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company receives its application for approval of the marketing of advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the chest, the brain, the bones, or the soft parts (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is a" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce any copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein that is formed from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni's cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraumeni cancer occurred in the area of the underbelly, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had reviewed the company's answers to the questions it had been asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents, the CHMP grants a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">In the opinion of the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injections of advexin in Li-wommeni-tumours carry benefits for the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform CHMP if the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or "Combi-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified ingredient release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is immediately released and the other released slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the onset of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In case of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients receiving aerinaze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine on their own.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients who did not alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroiosis) or have a hemorrhagic stroke (cerebral haemorrhoea) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transfer of aerinaze to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is swallowed whole (i.e. without shredding, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms are finished.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstriktors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, lisydroergotamine or other deonconjunctiva, the peroral or nasal as a digested Rhinoplasty (phenylpropanol, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient and the data is not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or amplification of the headache) must be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Care should be taken when treating the following patient groups: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to be deprecated at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials involving Desolatadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazol were additionally given, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with chlorosis and placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether or not desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desolatadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however did not increase the frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transfered to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive characteristics of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to a dizziness that may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS-depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible sequential processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravated miction, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, predictive pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly probable in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the P-selectin receptor on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desolatadin showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flux, including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of sleepiness was observed at the recommended dose of 5 mg. a day compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine at recommended dosage can cause further likeable effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereas 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine via the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosal swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with Desolatadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets did not show any significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the oral application of aerinaze for healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of Desolatadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the course of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test persons were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component-interaction study showed that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the only gift of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to exposure after administration of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional safety-harmacology studies, toxicity with repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, however, the preclinical data with Desolatadin do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the pharmacovigilance system described in module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to alleviating allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and tears or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases with the use of aerinaze: • high blood pressure • Heart chasing, palpitations • Cardiac arrhythmia • nausea and headache, or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Traffic-tightness and the operation of machines In the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aerinaze leads to lightheadedness or reduces attention.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin it was very rare reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, varicose veins, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of abnormal liver disease has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisat for intake (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to 11 years, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (among them four studies with seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies to patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Effectiveness was measured by determining the change in the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadruped, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to intake and the glaze tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria, the decrease in the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Desloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the use of desloratadin in adolescents 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous course of illness and can be terminated after the end of the symptoms and can be resumed at their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persisting allergic rhinitis (onset of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended for an ongoing treatment during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Desolatadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may come to lightheadedness which may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% of patients with Aerius were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg. daily compared to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial involving 578 young patients aged 12 to 17, the most common adverse event was a headache, which was treated with 5.9% of patients treated with "desloratadin" and 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study involving up to 45 mg of Desolatadin (nine times clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the P-selenium adhesion molecule to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses, in which desloratadin was administered at a dose of up to 20 mg. a day for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinically pharmacological study, in which Desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, no prolongation of the Qtc interval showed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desolatadin showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flux, including the strengthening of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be classified as an alternative also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown in the overall results of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronic idiopathic urticaria was examined for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology is similar to the etiology of the different forms and can be easily recruited for chronic patients.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine is a causative factor in all age-related diseases, it is expected that in addition to the chronic idiopathic urticaria, other forms of urticaria may lead to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with obloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetics study, where the patient's findings were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of the patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clues for clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desolatadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins is.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken regardless of meals, to relieve symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see Section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, the anamnesis, physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Around 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratadin and experience higher substance concentrations (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 that can be metabolized is identical to that of children who metabolize normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-lactose-absorption or sucrose-Isomaltase- insufficiency should not use this medicine.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desolatadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadin can be extrapolated to the child population in adults.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In the context of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1779">At a single-day dose of 7.5 mg Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents did not interfere with psychomotor impairment.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither led to a strengthening of alcohol-induced performance impairment nor an increase in drowsiness.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown in the overall results of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets will effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation for children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which metabolise fully metabolised.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially informed the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products of Aflunov for the prevention of the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from human to human because humans have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to produce antibodies with a flu virus in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognises as a body alien) was purified and used as an integral part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you wish to participate in a clinical examination and require further information on your treatment, please contact your doctor treating.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information on the basis of the recommendations of the CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years, who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for intake, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed once the doctor has examined which antiviral medicines the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus will be addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years of age and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thereby also the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, which was fortified with low-dosed Ritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to be protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few people responded to the treatment of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study involving adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the Agenerase drug, enhanced by Ritonavir, was as effective as other protease inhibitors after 16 weeks of treatment:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasers, Agenerase, together with Ritonavir, came to a greater decrease in the viral load after four weeks compared to those patients who continued their protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea, flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agasy must also not be used in patients, the St. John's Wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depressions) or medicines that are degraded as well as agasy and are health-harmful in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines against HIV, there is a risk of cerebral disease (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonecsis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The CHMP (CHMP) Committee concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children were outweighed over four years versus the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of asgeneric ase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who previously did not have a protease inhibitor has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the transport of agasy in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) in adults and children aged 4 and over.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules should be administered to the pharmacokinetic booster of Amprenavir along with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% lower than the capsule; therefore, Agenerase Capsules and solution for intake on a milligram per milligram basis are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily together with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase Capsules are used without the enhancing addition of Ritonavir (Boosters), higher doses of agasy (1200 mg twice a day) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgeneric ase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agasy is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4, due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgeneric ase should not be given concurrently with pharmaceuticals that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450 isocyte 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver damage with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous anti-viral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased frequency of hepatic dysfunctions under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovestatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For certain medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available to determine the active substance concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these drugs at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of drug interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given concurrently with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this dosage form is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agasy should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which medicines were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hepophile patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in hematomas, including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis, are present.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections resulting in severe clinical conditions or worsening symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is adopted (including corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoneclasis were reported especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase should not be given concurrently with pharmaceuticals that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450 isocyte 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir must not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly mixed with CYP2D6 and associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% decrease in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the low plasma levels caused by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels are and, if possible, to check the viral load and suspend St. John's Wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, whereas CMAx is reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amprenavir were used twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was performed for the use of asgeneric ase in combination with didanosine, but due to the antazical component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of didanosine and agasy are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adaptation is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine may lower the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs are to be used at the same time, caution is advised as Delavirdin could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are used together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as the exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">Simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin should be at least half the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of 700 mg of fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily resulted in an increase of the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69times compared to the value observed after 200 mg of ketoconazole once daily without concurrent application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these drugs if used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as Agenerase as it can cause resorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzymers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), amprenavir can cause a degradation of plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israthipin, Nicardipins, nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir by increasing the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous intake of Agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and strengthen the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days, the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous donation of Agenerase with Ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovestatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases of plasma levels are expected with simultaneous administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma concentrations of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with Amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous injection of amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, agasy must not be used along with oral midazolam (see Section 4.3), while caution is recommended while using Agenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinase inhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with Amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opiate withdrawal symptoms, especially if at the same time low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historic comparisons, no recommendations can currently be given, such as the amprenavirus dose, when Amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dosing of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended while Agenerase is administered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy only after careful weighing of the potential benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactation rats, Amprenavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether amprenavir is transferred to breast milk in people.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study on pregnant rats, which was administered by the implantation in the uterus until the end of the lactation period amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in the 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of descendants, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Agenerase's harmlessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurring early and rarely lead to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether or not they are in connection with the use of Agenerase or any other medicines used at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1,200 mg of asgeneric ase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, and laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) occurring during the treatment are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and facial fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocerebral fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral not pretreated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudin / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (sticks) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study we performed 7 cases (3%) in 245 NRTIs in 241 patients (11%) in 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over an average duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or macular nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to stop treatment with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoneclasis were reported especially in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In PI Pretreated patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice a day together with low dose sisterone (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In the event of an overdose, the patient is to observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, are necessary supporting measures to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gag and gag-pol- polyprotein stages with the result of a formation of non-infectious, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% hemming concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir versus HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not pretreated patients with currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages, as with other Ritonavir proteinase inhibitors, the mutations described rarely have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not pre-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred within week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of isolates of 13 of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 included patients with protease inhibitors demonstrated resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 trial and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease-inhibiting isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, V82A / C / F / G, I84V and L90M in combination with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir as well as decreased likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic testing can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease-inhibiting isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypical cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with decreased sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross-resistance to ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data concerning cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients, in which a Fosamprenavirus-containing pattern failed (one of them pointed to a resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 25 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), indinavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease-resistant isolates; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a sawing therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits which can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which patients treated with PI (100 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard of care (SOC) with a PI, predominantly associated with low-dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1-RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1-RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-lethal threshold of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbleached asgeneric ase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children between 2 and 18 years of age, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies asgeneric ase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks about 25% of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on these data, the anticipated benefits of" "" "unborn" "" "agasy should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI-treated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir amounts to approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, by contrast, reduced by 30% for CMAx when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, where the amount of inbound Amprenavir, which represents the active part, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of inbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active constituent varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the area of CMAx, ss up to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 should be administered with caution when administered simultaneously with Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase Capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is of the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of renal dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir twice a day without concurrent kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occurred in male animals, who corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8 times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dosage of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was not yet clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and therapeutical applications, showed little evidence of the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vitro and in-vitro-genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse-mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microcore test on rats and chromosomal aberrations tests on human peripheral lymphocytes were neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and demonstrated in clinical life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Previously, no significant liver toxicity in patients was observed in clinical studies, neither during the administration of Agenerase after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated from 4 days of age showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbits) or significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus atrophy and minor skeletal changes were observed, indicating a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase Capsules are used without the enhancing addition of Ritonavir (Boosters), higher doses of agasy (1200 mg twice a day) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For certain medicines which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods are available to determine the active substance concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and drug dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of Amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice daily with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, but a close monitoring is recommended since the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these drugs are used together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as the exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of Rifabutin should be at least half the recommended dose 31 although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Israthipin, Nicardipins, nifedipine, Nimodipine, Nisoldipine and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical trial in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days, the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin of Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% hemming concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, Amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease-resistant isolates; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the anticipated benefits of "unborn" agasy should be taken into consideration when optimizing the treatment of pre-treated children.</seg>

<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is less chance of response to imiquimiodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not studied for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the use of imiquimiodine for the treatment of actinic keratooses in anatomic areas outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratosis on the underarms and hands do not support the efficacy of this application, therefore such application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after discontinuing treatment with imiquimiodine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause severe discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 active lesions showed less complete healing rates than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immunostimulatory properties, Imiquimiodine should be used with caution in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not show direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, maternity or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were achieved neither after a one-time nor after repeated topical application, no recommendation can be given during lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and probably or possibly associated with the application of Imiquimiodine related side effects in studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the field of treatment of inclinations (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimiodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most frequently reported and most likely or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod cream related side effects include discomfort on the site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalioma patients treated with imiquimiodine and placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse reactions in these studies were a response to the application site (22% of patients treated with imiquimiodine) in these studies.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Adverse events reported from 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of Phase III with Imiquimiodine-Cream treated patients with actinic keratoplasty are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The assessment of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimiodine, it is common to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excitation / skewing (23%) and edema (14%).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with imiquimiodine, severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe scarring and destruction (19%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials for the treatment of Imiquimiodine for the treatment of actin keratosis, alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental one-time oral recording of 200 mg of imiquimiodine, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side-effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was in hypotony, normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were observed after topical imiquimiodine application.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies it could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a full healing of the inclinations in an imiquimiodine treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the total of 119 patients treated with Imiquimod, the patient was fully cured; this was the case of 20% of the patients who treated placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete recovery was achieved at 23% of 157 with imiquimiodine treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo-treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of imiquimiodine at five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary supernormal basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and that they remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimiodine at three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic acne lesions within a related 25 cm2 area of treatment on the unhairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods (35 / 128 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external inclinations, actinic keratosis and supernormal basal cell carcinoma usually do not appear in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimiodine = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies at the doses studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or ≤ 16 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% imiquimiodine cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed in the three-week application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were measured in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was approximately 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that imiquimiodine resorption was low after topical application to MC-affected skin of patients aged 6-12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratoplasty or supernormal basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study on dermal application conducted for four months showed no similar effects with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days per week did not induce tumors at the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimiodine has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, it is a risk for humans due to systemic exposure as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can hurt other people, even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the side effects are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently used, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your baby during treatment with Aldara cream, since it is not known whether imiquimiodine occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different with inclination, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin with the cowards and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is completely drained.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with genital warts under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath. (see section 2 "What do you have to consider before using Aldara cream?").</seg>

<seg id="2265">A reduced number of blood cells can make you more prone to infection; it can cause a blue stain to occur in you or it can cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects you notice significantly affects you or notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas that you have applied aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">In most cases, it is easier skin reactions that end in about 2 weeks after the treatment is completed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients notice changes in the application area (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scarring, skin irritation, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, aggravate movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be supervised by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revitalization devices, and patients may require appropriate medicines prior to the administration in order to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study evaluated the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was measured (by examining its effect in terms of reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by around 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyms in patients aged over 5 years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), feeling of heat, fever and reactions to the infusion body.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurment of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to larvae idase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information potentially disclosed each year and where necessary to update this summary whenever necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">Aldurazyme, a manufacturer of Aldurazyms, will observe the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit to the Genzyme Europe B.V. business for the transport of Aldurazyms throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-iduronidase and is produced by recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster omvary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in adults over 65 years has not been ascertained, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been identified, and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and Aldurazyme's infusion should only be performed in an appropriate clinical environment where medical emergencies are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study we expect almost all IgG antibodies to form against larvae, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-induced responses must be treated with care when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, the risk of an oversensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment must be cautiously preceded by the theoretically elevated risk of an oversensitivity reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Pretreat 60 minutes before the onset of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretracts) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of a light or medium-severe infusion reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular intake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">As no data on newborns exposed to maternal milk over maternal milk is present, it is recommended not to breastfeed during the treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mostly reported as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in phase 3 study (duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyms, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older, are listed in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions including bronchospasm, respiratory and visual edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects related to Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged less than 5 years, with predominantly severe trial and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients had a serum version within 3 months of the treatment, whereas in the age of 5 years a seroconferous serum was found (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until early excretion from the study), there were no detectable antibodies in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients who had never come to Serokonversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust decrease in the GAG-level in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or decrease of GAGs in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substratum and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lymphocytes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the total distance in the 6-minute walking test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg aldurazyms each week (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and salinity to the placebo group which is shown in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the percentage FEV to be expected is not clinically significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportionally to the size of the children growing.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the GAG mirrors in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous manifestation of the disease between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, the clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (mean percentage of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity) was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open Phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe failure form and 4 with the medium-run form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- mirror in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were noted after the Z-Score for this age group. the younger patients with the severe course of circulation had a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe decline only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosage schemes were performed on the GAG mirrors in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute walking test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 was similar to those with older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another medicine against cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not yet been treated in combination with Cisplatin and patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regimens.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should have a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during the treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (remedy against vomiting) and fluids should be given before or after the administration of cisplatin (to prevent fluid deficiency).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood picture changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, removed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetal mixed slows the formation of the DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleural therapy, Alimta was studied in a major study of 456 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer) in 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with Cisplatin in 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin had an average of 12.1 months compared to 9,3 months for the sole administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared with 7,9 months compared to docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells showed longer survival in the administration of Alimta compared to the comparison medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a permit for the transport of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Every water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The appropriate volume of the necessary dose is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with Cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominant plate-epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for prevalent dismal histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours after completion of Pemetrexed- Infusion on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetrexed Gift as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the duration of treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) a week before the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetrexed, a full blood picture should be created before each application, including a differentiation of leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into account the Nadirs of the blood picture or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the preceding treatment cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients have to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC level 2 hemorrhage.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients with non-hematological toxicity develop ≥ level 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be terminated if a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dosisreduktio- or so- fort the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies did not reveal that in patients aged 65 years of age or over 65 years of age, an increased risk of adverse side effects was reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adaptations were needed in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adaptations recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper borrowing coefficient and / or transhipment values of &gt; 3.0-times the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to disease progression and Pemetremixed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophy number has reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophy number, platelet number and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">Lower toxicity and a reduction of the degree of 3 / 4 haematological and non-hematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observable if pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetrexed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous use of non-steroidal antiphlogika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic acid (&gt; 1.3 g daily) for at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with Pemetrexed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs for at least 5 days before the treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had identified risk factors for the occurrence of renal events including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space a drainage of the effusion before the Pemetrexed treatment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Several cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials involving Pemetremixed occasionally, when this compound was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible peeling of the reproductive capacity is due to Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment ginn to obtain advice on the preservation of sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal antiphlocid (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid can result in reduced Pemetal loss with the result of increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore caution is advised if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are used in high doses for patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">(ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and min. 2 days after the treatment with pemetrexed can be avoided (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">As there is no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with Pemetrexed for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetre- xed can be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of Pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected for an application in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy, except if necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to Pemetrexed, men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice on the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetal mixed into breast milk exceeds and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized cisplatin and Pemetreticated as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive Cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic antibody that exercises its effect by interrupting weight-like folate-dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetremixed acts as anti-folate with multiple attack points by blocking thymidylatsynthase (DHFR) and glycine amidribonucleotide myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymidin- and purple nucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, simple-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus Cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleural amesothelioma showed that with ALIMTA and Cisplatin treated patients had a clinically significant advantage over survival compared to those patients who were only treated with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared with 391 overweight patients with a BMI of 25 to 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received 60 mg. of alli had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no significant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily patches on after, flatus (winch) with stucco, stool, oily / oily chair, branch oily secretions (feces), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokalically, fat-induced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">"" "" "" "alli must not be used by children and young people under the age of 18 since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety." ""</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is resorbed to minimal resorption, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the anti-diabetic should be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional anti-contraception measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A reduction of Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed in both a study on drug interactions and in several cases with concurrent orlistat and Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants combined with orlistat, the Quick-Values (International Standard Ratio, INR) could be influenced (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplement of multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a one-time dose of Amiodarone, a minor decrease in the ammiodarone plasma concentration was observed for a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies did not show direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal and related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 10), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects noted after the launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli may result in anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of reported cases of orlistat overdose reported cases, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid regression of possible systemic effects deriving from orlistat's ligible properties can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect is applied in the lumens of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonds to the active Serin remainder of the gastric and pankreatic lipids.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocked the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocalory, fat-induced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight during study course (Table 1) and as part of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight reduction was observed in both studies over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline value 5,20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline value: 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline: 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, metabolized orlistat in plasma was only sporadic and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study involving obese patients who were given the minimal systemic resorbated dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonring) and M3 (M1, after separation of the N-molyl-leucine group) could be identified, representing approximately 42% of total plastic concentrations.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (like cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, the moderate nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an anti-emetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate causes for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the case of chemotherapies, the strong cause of nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (132 of 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapies, the moderate nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (153 of 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 from 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval for the marketing of Aloxi across the European Union to the Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strongly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for preventing nausea and vomiting induced by strong emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with amnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi should neither be used for prevention nor treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five investigated chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a one-time intravenous Palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentration of oral Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (ammiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, halitidine, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies does not exist, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events associated with a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least potentially associated with Aloxi, were a headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of the administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; no dose-effect relationships were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were conducted, however, due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably no effective therapy with an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg. of Dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours) were given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m ² cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared with patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, given intravenously in day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the study with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strong emetogenic chemotherapy were combined in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of Palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of palliative Palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the surface under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable with the value measured after a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the CMAx was higher after the disposable dosage of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which compared to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the Isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous junctival injection the total body temperature was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Admittedly, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminale exclusion period and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only by expositions, which are considered sufficiently over the maximum humantherapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, evidence suggests that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately the 30x of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given every day for over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and because Aloxi is intended for one-time use in humans, the relevance of these results is low compared to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) adopted a negative report recommending the approval of the approval of the Medicines Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution for the treatment of hepatitis C.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called" "" "Roferon-A" "" "with the same drug that has already been approved in the EU (also referred to as" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, the liver tissue damages the liver tissue; furthermore, the values of the liver enzyme Alanin- Aminotransferase (ALT) are normalized in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon manufactures data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the hepatitis C study, the efficacy of alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after adjustment of the treatment to the medication (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting up with Alpheon, the disease was reduced to more patients than with the reference medical drug, and Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition to this, the test used in the study to investigate whether the drug will respond to an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirations (cracking or cutting wounds), abrasions and stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for treatment of infections proven or presumably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alarms may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the area to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby hinders the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients suffering from placebo responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin findings, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together with skin findings, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it has been found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the place of application.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirations, abrasions or stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit to introduce Altargo to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of raising awareness or serious local irritation due to the use of reapamulin ointment, treatment should be stopped, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection can be commenced.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamulin is not meant to be used for the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary open wounds, the efficacy of reapamination in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered, if after a 2-3 day treatment no improvement or worsening of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of reapamin- and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on skinned skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo cannot be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2-times daily 200 mg of ketoconazole the average reapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% Retapamin- ointment on skimmed skin of healthy adult men increased 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adaptations are not considered necessary if topical Retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity according to oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement affecting the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy, if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of reapamulin is preferable to systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether the breastfeeding continues / terminates or the therapy with altargo should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which were used by Altargo, the most commonly reported side effect irritation occurred at the administration of approximately 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic Derivate of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, blocking P-binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the use of reapamulin seem questionable on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to at least some Infection Molds, a consultation should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamines compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to respond to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains should be considered with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamin- ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamin- ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medication and children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 shielded skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomites was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) performed over 14 days there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro analysis on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats microcore test for in-vivo analysis of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats indications of reduced fertility for oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby an up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 sheared skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study in rats at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (see above), developmental toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity was established.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the permit for the placing of the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambient rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years of age, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, and it may only be possible to protect hepatitis B after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization and ensuring that the vaccination plan existing in two doses can be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by helping the immune system (the body's natural defense) as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">It contains the same ingredients as the vaccination for vaccines that have been approved since 1996 and the vaccination for vaccines that have been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinet adults and Twinet children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinet adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the use of Twinet adults have also been used as evidence of the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children, Ambirix initiated a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccines) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue, and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals company to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for primetization with Ambirix consists of two doses of vaccines, with the first dose being given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose between six and twelve months.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster vaccine is required for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, the respective monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody values are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to a hepatitis C vaccine need a refresher vaccination as they may be protected by immunological memory even if antibodies are no longer detectable.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection-vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the injection of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended using the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels, so that the administration of further doses can be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intramuscular injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscle could lead to a suboptimal immaculate result, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In case of thrombocytopenia or blood coagulation disorders, however, it may be injected subcutaneously, as it may occur in these cases after intramuscular injection.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and haemophilus type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or combined with a combined mass mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects must assume that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturability, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomerisation and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 doses of the Ambirix vaccine were given to a total of 1027 vaccinations aged 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the tolerance of Ambirix was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturability on a calculation basis per vaccine dose, but not on a basis for calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the entire vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had received the ambilight reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated using the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable to per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and maturability was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to those observed when administered with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines, which reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccines with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen, was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, anti-HAV serum conversion rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The anti-HBs conversion rates were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose administered for month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthless, the Seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month of 2 and 6 after administration of the 3-dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study from 1 to 11 year-olds a month after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the table below.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunologic response observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units formalin-inactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study in 12- to including 15-year-olds, it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6-month vaccination scheme compared to the in the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered at the same time as a combined diphtheri-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 haemophilus type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates as for the earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is examined both before and after resuspening on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2782">• If your child has already demonstrated an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rash, shortness of breath or swelling of your face or tongue. • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child has severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of an vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection before ending the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes your child will suffer from severe bleeding disturbances, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's own defence, or if you / her child will undergo a haemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambiente can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you / your child will take other medicines (including those you can receive without prescribing) or if you / your child has recently been vaccinated / has been given / has been given or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with ambition, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">When ambiente is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, ambition will not be given to pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is highly necessary to be vaccinated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other components of Ambirix please inform your doctor if you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very often (more than 1 case per 10 impoverished doses): • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mateness • irritability • headaches • Loss of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">Allergy sufferers (up to 1 case per 10 impoverished doses): • swelling at the injection site • fever (over 38 ° C) • Intensive • Gastro-intestinal discomfort</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other adverse events reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (less than 1 case per 10,000 misused doses) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include localized or extended lapels that can be itchy or inflamed, swelling of the eye area and face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden blood pressure drop and loss of consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="2801">Flu-like symptoms, including chills, muscular and joint pain, seizures, dizziness, misperceptions such as tingling and "ant running," multiple sclerosis, nervous disorders, loss of sensation or mobility of some body parts, severe headaches and stiffness of the neck, interruption of normal brain functions</seg>
<seg id="2802">Fainting inflammation of some blood vessels causes nausea or disease, loss of appetite, diarrhea and abdominal pain. lymph node swelling increases tendency to bleeding or bruising (bruises) caused by the amount of blood platelets.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data that has been known since the first approval was granted for the placing of the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix will remain positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Amrix was brought into circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme failure or with hyperammonia encephalopathy (cerebral damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is - divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed into the food or administered via a gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no comparative study because Ammonaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo treatment, i.e. without active ingredient).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonia can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste eases, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The CHMP (CHMP) Committee concluded that ammonia in patients with disorders of the urea cycle has effectively prevented high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this drug was presented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete lack of enzyme has already manifested itself in newborns (within the first 28 live days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifal form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for use if a hyperammonic encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifal deficiency of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must obtain arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk of esophagus ulcera when the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and edema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyate via the liver and kidneys takes place, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the case of subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted to the breast milk in humans, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during lactation (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one adverse event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and 78% of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose occurred in a 5-month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity for intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an metabolically active compound, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that the sodium phenylbutyl concentration of 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine can be produced for every gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifal form of the disease with occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infantist, and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By haemodialysis, the use of alternative ways of excretion of nitrogen (sodium chloride, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at post-partal (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the onset of hyperammonic encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifal form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the OrnithinTranscarbamdylase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyate and a protein-reduced diet, survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is enzymatic conjugated in the liver and kidney, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and metabolites in plasma and urine were obtained after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate were found 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-cycle disturbances or haemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was no acetylacetate in the plasma after the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis, which were treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma concentrations were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medicine is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus test results, sodium phenylbutyrat did not have any complained effects in toxic and non-toxic cans (study 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who cannot yet swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or through a gastrostomy or nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifal deficiency of carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions were found in the pyramids of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that the sodium phenylbutyl concentration of 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine can be produced for every gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further worsening of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate were found 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During durability, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains a small measuring spoon 0.95 g, the middle measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the toxic waste products which accumulate after the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS as sodium phenylbutyrat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken, even if they are not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you should not take AMMONAPS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, obstruction of hearing, disorientation, memory disturbances and a worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you encounter any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you forgot to take AMMONAPS, take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in the blood picture (red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, unpleasant skin odor, rash, renal dysfunction, weight gain and abnormal lab results.</seg>

<seg id="2877">They should take AMMONAPS distributed on equal single doses or via a gastric fistula (tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (tube, which is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">• Take from the tank a heaped measuring spoon of granulate. • Place a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the knife spoon, to remove excess granulate. • Take the recommended number of measuring scoop granules from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with "acute coronary syndrome" (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), for instance with unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stem elevation" (an anomalous measure of the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients with a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angioxic in case of any gift or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients were frequently employed (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure), and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots such as depciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox- with or without administration of GPI was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, angioxin relation to all indicators was as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angioxin may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivaliant, other Hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who have recently been bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or serious kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The CHMP (CHMP) Committee reached the conclusion that angioxin the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the transfer of angioxins across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST-raising infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angioxin in patients with ACS is an intravenous perfusion of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in a further sequence, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI I can resume the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure a bolus of 0.5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angioxin patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolus of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and an intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a certain bolus-administration of angioxic was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed before the application and the recommended dose is quickly given intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT attaches value to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivaliant against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is below 225 seconds, it is possible to administer a second nut dose of 0.3 mg / kg and check the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which were included for approval, the ACT attaches 5 minutes after the application of the BiValirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment on average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients, angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the completion of the intravenous administration of fractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular lifting.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against Hirudine • active bleedings or increased bleeding risk due to a disturbance of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most of the haemorrhages occur in patients with bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur during treatment in principle throughout all kinds of haemorrhages.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients receiving warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, monitoring of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after finishing the treatment with Bivalirudin can once again reach the level prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombocyte aggregators) it can be assumed that these drugs increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregate or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental studies are insufficient in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, maternity or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to bivaliant alone, 4604 were randomised to bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin were more common in women and patients over the age of 65 compared to male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to the ACUITY and Timi scales for severe bleeding, as in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleeding performed significantly less often than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intraarterial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reduction of haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with well known point of bleeding, Reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed bleeding localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" point positions, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose and neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with bivaliant in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin were more common in women and patients over the age of 65 compared to male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported in practice after comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of an overdose, the treatment with bivaliant must be stopped immediately and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivaliant, a direct and specific thromboinhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and the anion-indentation region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombombine is in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of Bivalirudin on Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because thromboin, in turn, slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of thromboin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin with serum from patients with which in the past had come to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) did not induce thrombocyte aggregation response.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentric anticoagulatory effect which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the following cases, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivaliantine should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, fractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST-raising infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin Lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot work effectively, Apidra was examined in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% on human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to islanisine or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH an approval for the transfer of Apidra to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or to apply subcutanium through continuous infusion into the abdominal area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced gluconeogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with reduced liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the active force, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can cause a change in the insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3. insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Switching from one patient to another insulin type or insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when switching to the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">These include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics like beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and spare pin the symptoms of adrenergic anticogulation can be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between intra- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in the human breast milk, but in general insulin does not occur in the mother's milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed undesirable medications known from clinical studies, grouped by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10); not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, excess hun- ger, vision changes, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wird fails to continuously change the injection point within the injection unit, subsequently a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection point.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by means of intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Following an injection of glucose, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal musculature and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin the activity occurs faster and the duration of the activity is shorter than with normal levels of normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male subjects aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutic dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a disproportionate glucosing effect, and 0.3 E / kg or more an underproportional increase in glucosing effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin Lulisin has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves complete glucosing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post denoundiale glycaemic control is achieved as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin was heightened 2 minutes before the meal, a better post denouncement than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal, was achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is applied 15 minutes after the meal begins, a comparable glycaemic control as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- nudes before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin Lulisin for 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) as well as in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-lulisin for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal in comparison to human normal-acting insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
