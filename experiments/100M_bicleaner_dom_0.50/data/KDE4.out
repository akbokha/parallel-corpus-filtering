the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings ... Open the Tool@@ bar tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that you may need more modules on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page that has crashed &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes if present .
the module view filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras &apos; View Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , example : document@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the specific@@ ity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size .
in &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a file or folder reflects the size of a file or folder . thus , large files , even then easily detected , can easily be detected if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View may be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles possess meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle turned over view color mode can be either depth for the easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file attribute , such as the name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( and therefore you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle ) .
in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always comp@@ lied with . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and this frame will need space , which is no longer available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how parti@@ tioning the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this context , it is advisable for the cap@@ tion and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames to create rectangular rec@@ tan@@ gles that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view in the area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry .
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; conceived as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ get , which was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Photo Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the gallery , a dialog opens , allowing you to specify the image of the gallery .
the Tit@@ le of the page allows you to edit the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line option has a sli@@ ders and a rotation field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
display the file name of the picture with the check box to see if the file names are shown in the images in the gallery .
show the box file size of the image to see if the file size is shown in the images in the gallery .
with the image size check box , see if the size of the images is shown in the images in the gallery .
in the dialog , specify where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the file selection Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
copy original pictures with the check box to see if the original pictures should be copied to the gallery .
to use the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images than in the original images .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported via the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use these to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing skills can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image plu@@ gins interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens to be searched for .
like all &amp; quot ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it is dependent on supporting the end users . therefore , they should report problems and possibilities for improvement .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to make reporting problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; are , then we encourage you to encourage the user mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ kam ; homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to take part in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you plan &amp; edit ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data collection is stored . this path stays the same for all picture folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ kam set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders . &amp; digi@@ kam ; look at each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ ably recur@@ sively calls the library path in its entire depth . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folder . you can do this by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ kam your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it is possible to work with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help .
how to setup this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ ation and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported via the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
digital cameras , which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras , also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a popular protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions across the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ phot@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
the Ex@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the thumb@@ nails . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails may not be standing or generating could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP I modules : the K@@ DE Image plu@@ gins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to provide K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for K@@ IP I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to complement a function when the changes to &amp; digi@@ kam ; to perform itself .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can store an image in another part of the tree , above the horizontal partition line or in another application window . the only limitation is that the image cannot be stored in keywords , data lists or searches .
- a file type selection allows you to remove the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus filtering on the file name only works if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can you configure in the Al@@ ben@@ settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ eper ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were created on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album &apos;s properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly in an album . select album Im@@ por@@ tieren images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select album Im@@ ports screen shot .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select the album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you have placed will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete a collection from the tool@@ bar . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums After Date .
the elders , average , New test@@ ers : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of last change of each file will be used in this folder .
when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ eper . this is meant to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another picture as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; Select as album preview list ; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ignored .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left side of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will show you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be displayed in this album in the image window . each picture is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album for the first time , you have to wait briefly while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails .
information on each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information is this can be edited by editing ; set up the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important properties including all the tags of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the section Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all about &amp; digi@@ kam ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing displays your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to them . you can select all the functions with &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can choose between viewing images , slide show or editing images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by editing either F@@ 4 Image editing ... or selecting the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and editing ... . in the editing section , you can see how to edit your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the opening menu . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing with other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data with you when you save the changed image . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to right @-@ click on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam ; delete , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ eper ; organizes your photos based on data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ as@@ he@@ et at the bottom of the data view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or searching .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your words lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ched list ; fold so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . furthermore , the keywords are re @-@ imported when &amp; digi@@ kam ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keywords , or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword using the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword to move . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and selecting the keyword &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to select another picture as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select As the album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to provide with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My stit@@ ching info ; alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the preview of the pictures and select keyword sub@@ menu from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can give a keyword to each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keyword , it will be shown below the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can right @-@ click the right mouse button of the photo and select from the menu @-@ menu Rem@@ ove . the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent adjusting hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , just click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit . this displays all associated images in the main window .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps , and even more in the future .
the search box is a small lamp that is green when the search hits . if you click here the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as search criteria . after you have been saved , it filters in the list .
if you are satisfied with your choice , press the head OK and search is done . the results will be used in the View My Search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection once again , you only have to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the form will appear again with the search information you have entered . if you choose to edit as advanced search , the dialog for the extended search will appear . here you can find more rules for the search . for more information , see the Advanced Search Tool .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the Search context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules will be added to the search group / search group added or deleted from it . any option can be associated with others using the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NE@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . using a sw@@ ell@@ ert , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you push a picture from anywhere via the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand @-@ paint sketch : draw a quick sketch and work and find the matching pictures . here too , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map finder based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lighting table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Add the lumin@@ ous table from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous table and its window open . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ came ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is visible . if you select preview from the tool@@ bar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , you can also compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures . if you use pair @-@ wise navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images will be automatically loaded into the areas to the same . the picture to the right is displayed in the right @-@ hand corner . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images .
of course , normal delete actions work directly out of the lighting table like F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nail frames . this makes it easy to associate visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see at the crossed arrows . to wave the visible area of the picture , you must click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down in the preview and then both pictures will show the same image area .
the zoom works as well as in other views . just use the zoom controller under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - aside from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use your pictures . here , we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , backup , backup , dup@@ licate , archive , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management absor@@ bs , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tures and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data about data . in accordance with your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you don &apos;t even need to find a specific photo without inventory management . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ kam ; the approach can store metadata both in a database and in the image files , and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive sometime .
you might be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will publish sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements , such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant feed of images on different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend saving the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam the metadata stored in the editing page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do this , edit and edit a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , labels and a rating to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the further work .
now let &apos;s continue with keywords , keywords , as you frequently name in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ ged images from another source with embedded keyword , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or add the images to the right place . selecting the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the diagram shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very crude representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach@@ panorama . if you look closer , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I &apos;ll tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the french Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! one starts to dream , to have associations , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the subject you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text as let@@ tering in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) . you can even export it for a selection of images . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? wasn &apos;t it a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now at a speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that some@@ day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export c@@ ml files you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a wor@@ ding with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ kam which should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desirable to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization may not be changed .
author &apos;s title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : links with the author . examples of this can be titles like : employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright paragra@@ phs although they do not provide protection against abuse . each of which has a little more than basic knowledge in work with calcul@@ ator , this can only be of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives . in this section , we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these cau@@ tious ones have to be treated and you can &apos;t wait longer than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive .
CD / DVD discs can become un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording equipment and store them in the correct way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable .
75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there is an inexpensive program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read out the damaged data from damaged disk , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray Disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ proprietary format . then read out the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides on this subject a large field study about the fault mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can &apos;t detect this error . some of S@@ MA@@ RT identified errors announce the immediate failure . these are especially read errors and displacement counters . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , it looks different with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause scrat@@ ched key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed motherboard and other defects . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in strip . however , remember that not every plug @-@ in strip also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
because an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide voltage sho@@ cks which also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . this gives you the ability to store your data and keep the system down . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety when it comes to electricity disrup@@ tions with the cost to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can be reached by up to € 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can include it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offering to store any amount of data .
they are compared to the hard drives home though very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are directed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . thanks to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transfer chain on the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred to you , not when this happened in your hardware . all these interrup@@ tions remain un@@ discovered until you open a photo one day and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer route than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at the moment , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes a year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard compatible with GP@@ L . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used by Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebook and 46 % on work@@ stations . when not@@ ebooks , the share of the@@ fts is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lesser damage , e.g. theft or re @-@ installation . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most popular file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that as the technology develops further there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . a sensor size of 6 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t worry anyone else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year . therefore , backup your data in a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous , like re@@ installing your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make every day your backup on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash gets you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and the@@ fts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a frequent reason for data loss despite f@@ use is panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . this creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file trans@@ missions , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ss@@ h .
back up important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
this procedure gives you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata that stored IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , retain associate X@@ MP files , retain original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , restore images and metadata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to nature , you need to look at everything that is said today with caution and re@@ assess as time goes by . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , your storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * nix systems such as &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk was detected by the system but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; nbsp ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; Par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG has been designed as an open source standard that should replace GI@@ F . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can recommend Gam@@ ma@@ - and Chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment at hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( de@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras , you can store your images in this format .
D@@ NG &apos;s digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to using metadata .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Educational resource block ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata plat@@ form@@ Tags , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive your recording , most of them in the raw format , because it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fying efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera edi@@ um are , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
you can use external programs for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing . if you edit the images again with &amp; edited , then you should add metadata again . these were cut off by the other programs under certain circumstances .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them in web galleries , code in m@@ peg , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the section adding a photo to an album you can add a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use it , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is established , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file association , photos , movies , music etc. will be displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . this information is the same as for the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all . this downloads all photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend to check if the pictures are safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods . once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download select . the selected button is downloaded until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you download the buttons all download or download selected albums , a dialog allows you to select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed in the My Albums section . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; downloads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at a time by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All . if you only want to delete some , then you have to select them first and then delete the selected delete .
please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera ; the photos will not be copied to the sleeves ; they should be carefully checked before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera hook completely , you should do so via the camera command , as this is much faster .
the file names are normally re @-@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you load photos from different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the commit opens three more options that are performed before the photos are saved on the disk . the first two affect the data about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another date format than the standard format , for example , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the edit field .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ kam , is used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are stored and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera does not provide this information , it can be edited and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic turn , use the Exten@@ ded button and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ kam ; this can be used to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Exten@@ ded button and select the Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select up@@ loading . the file selection dialog box &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you where the pictures should be uploaded . a folder sel@@ ector dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . data analysis can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken you can open a browser showing the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ kam , users who want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; make g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script working with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool of Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ iry coordinates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; tries to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible . there are many settings that modify the behaviour of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you need to edit in the Settings menu ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be set on embedded preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fix when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the identity and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option has been selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for the author &apos;s line : this field should contain the professional title of the photographer . these can be names like e.g. hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a further description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this must not be the author , if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of other &amp; quot ; an@@ biet@@ en@@ quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group resp@@ . agency that provides the image should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this means that metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited and edited without lost .
save images as embedded scrip@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . note : in pictures that already contain cap@@ tions , they are over@@ written by the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests over a file in the main window . depending on the option selected , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
the brightness of &amp; digi@@ kam ; can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the LED these settings will not be available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression option you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce picture quality , because P@@ NG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression .
comp@@ ress the TI@@ FF @-@ files option to switch the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality , because the de@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss @-@ prone setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning process .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just a picture viewer for photos . currently it evol@@ ves very quickly to a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the image editing settings .
the default assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if you are more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option character@@ izes the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . default is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default it is the pointed @-@ lights , so the parts of your images that are burned , due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed @-@ lights , as a continuous white . the setting colors release creates some unusual results as they display the pointed lights in various rose tones .
this is possible because blue pixels in general don &apos;t satur@@ ate as quickly as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when you select the Rec@@ re@@ construct option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the editing pane ; to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Far@@ bre@@ Design .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ os @-@ Direc@@ ted ) created the quality for me and the paper used by me .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the rot@@ - and blue @-@ correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ dient correction as you are carried out during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to get it back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like the color information can be translated from a color space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files start .
color Profile Fol@@ ders Set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; check this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; default source ; to post@@ p@@ one for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon , which do not contain any color @-@ t@@ onal mapping or g@@ amma correction .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated . this could be corrected manually instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for . unfortunately , not for Canon models . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course , this answer is in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface can &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will then be edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short@@ cuts .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of slide show should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera features show on the left side a list of all supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atische Reco@@ gnition that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is connected properly , switched on and in picture display mode . currently , here are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer , you can set the conversation between &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly controlled by &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to store the changes using the button changes .
you can also display the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ kam ; when starting , this speeds up &amp; digi@@ kam the start @-@ up process .
the Start Start after new photos forces &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something is deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings Design . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement . the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the ad / editing entry .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in the Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , zoom factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top of the screen , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using Save or Save the button Save from the tool bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ producing or using the button The button Rest@@ ore the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving .
almost every action of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . you can undo the last action by modi@@ fying undo or restore by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and remember C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB , press the reverse or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in @-@ between will also be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword , using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made any changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : choose the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . normally , the tool bar is displayed . if you do not want this , you can call it in the editing dialog of &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can see this section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select print in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences . whole picture templates can be printed from your selection . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Prin@@ ter Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation file , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
besides the user button , there is a button . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ code C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field of Re@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree , and a selection box with previously mentioned keywords .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can easily limit the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the lower end is a further simpli@@ fication in entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all words of an image are stored in the keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only apply to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section .
the keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection . then , a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a cat@@ ch@@ word from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and dropped there . a dialog asks if this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be turned off in settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it needs to be one or its , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry to search in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an extended search through all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly worked on &amp; digi@@ kam ; s specific implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner come from a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that are the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark@@ room .
when the subject comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should allow you to make your own informed decisions in order to get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
they work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below )
their only other image output is via email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de @-@ facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB really works and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and thus have to worry about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cr@@ ush my monitor if I chose to work in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to configure your monitor because s@@ RGB states that your monitor is sti@@ cking to s@@ RGB . if you are working as in the color space of s@@ RGB then you must either use your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic matching and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correc@@ ting attempt automatically from your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aling the Leu@@ st@@ Str@@ ength above the whole picture , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest spot will change as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
matching : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ osity factor of the selected image , making the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel as flat as possible . sometimes the same amount of pixels is achieved by improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it identifies the dark and bright boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
enlarge contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a re @-@ ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted as there is a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ny@@ m . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be customized in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s settings . if you want to see the original white balance then click on the sub@@ window .
the target photos can be previ@@ ew@@ ed with a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above , a hist@@ ogram is shown to change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit pictures , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your results depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also dim down .
to play An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the chosen color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
save the buttons as and load exactly this . every setting of the white balance you have set you can store it in a text file and load it back later .
the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of shell images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles lets you consult the color management chapter .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several colour channels at the same time and allows you to store your settings so that you can always make use of them for more photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner is always making the same mistake and you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors Gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool colour effects provide four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that emerged when a partly developed pressure applied a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colours were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar process . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and it processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and hot . try it simple , it embell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a reverse colour film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos . you can also experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you make a photo with poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the brightness / satur@@ ation tool is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple contrast / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool clay correction is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialog has a very complicated effect on this tool , you only need the area of the slider for the application described here .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three slider will be cli@@ cked into and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controller to see how the image changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . previ@@ ew@@ ing will be dynamically updated based on the image &apos;s settings . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be adjusted whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic division is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three color pin@@ boards can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic alignment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values as inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the values set in the file system can be saved and loaded later . the Gim@@ p level format is used to do so .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values are automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , resources and satur@@ ation tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below , you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a picture . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fying channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and a log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera mostly the linear mode is the most useful . in this case , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a short arrow to the right , e.g. the bright notes , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the image pixels are darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a matching line will be shown on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
when you create this method and the three pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if you find over@@ exposed pixels in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shades of shade and sunshine were set using the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam channel mixer ; image processing is a tool to improve colour channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own tab .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line will appear in the hist@@ ogram to show you the appropriate color value .
the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to keep lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space . color @-@ bre@@ wing consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel is different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color @-@ bre@@ wing first .
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can save you for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re @-@ adjusted . the lumin@@ ance option is enabled . the original image can be seen in ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and simul@@ ates lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural colour tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
epi@@ th@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the re@@ development in a squ@@ am@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool texture , you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : post@@ p@@ one this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the altered under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool frame add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to retain his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame add the module from image editing .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . throughout , the image rot@@ ates with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , cooled it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adding a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any location . this also works in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply insert the text and place it with the mouse . you will need to adjust the font size of the image size . the bigger the picture , the bigger the character set must be . at the end , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &apos; OK &apos; . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool template apply you can lay a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu apply in image editing can be used to create templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you must take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the default folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder is set for the templates a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ inks : this button reduces the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas .
blu@@ r mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing may be the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras normally require more subsequent sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , a camera is often used for internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners alter a sharp@@ ness filter while reading the image . if you de@@ activate it , you will get control over your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing shar@@ pen . you can call this using the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sharp@@ ness .
the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also strengthens the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image re@@ focus the tool . in general , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too crisp . the solution to draw the image slightly sof@@ tly is much easier than sharpen@@ ing . use the tool for soft marking with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting plas@@ tici@@ zers and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter using the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of the radius or the amount increases the effect . if you make the blu@@ r mask strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates are generated near sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images permit larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the sum represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image , which is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference @-@ amount used . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between tones are excluded and therefore beauty defects in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . bl@@ urred mas@@ king has been applied with Radi@@ us = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted filtering algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing pictures is using a blu@@ r mask . re@@ focusing often reaches better results than bl@@ urred . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice , the circular holding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ ail@@ ure . the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ ail@@ ure has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ itting is even heavily influenced by the remote pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folds . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high correlation is reduced to the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are very rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further van@@ ish the picture .
this is most commonly caused by a previously executed blu@@ r filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transition matri@@ ces . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . however , note that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform any cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally Un@@ sharp Mas@@ ks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used than sharpen@@ ing .
in theory , invisible masks always have to produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never eliminate the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . practically , the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blu@@ r mask .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smoo@@ th@@ ened controller sets the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink duct allows a modified colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here .
the tool error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools for removing unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool includes several default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smoo@@ thing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should provide details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . please note that the detail conservation should always be subordin@@ ate to directional dependence .
directional dependence alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 only smoo@@ thes in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD noise will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value to match the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeat : indicates how often the algorithm will go through . normally , here is 1 or 2 .
angle step distance &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , it should also be small . be sure that small angles will generate a long term . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more the quality you receive by choosing this option is only minor , but it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to let it out .
the Save as and Load buttons make this happen . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting picture errors is relatively fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shut@@ down .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie shift during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to l@@ essen image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts , for example from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a coarse h@@ iss that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings sub@@ window can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can blu@@ r the image . the area indicated by the radius is smoo@@ thed over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine light seal changes . if it is increased , rou@@ gh@@ ness changes will be reset . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or black@@ s@@ ling occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value enhances the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or rou@@ gh@@ ness peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance depth tolerance of the image . we recommend modi@@ fying either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend modi@@ fying either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which are typically more harsh . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the alignment of the adaptive filter radius . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations in the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all the noise reduction parameters you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how smoking can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than shar@@ pen a picture . use tool for soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting plas@@ tici@@ zers and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
these filters for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos; r@@ ushing , film gra@@ dations , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG image arti@@ facts : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even far from it . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the save as and load buttons make this happen . every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and then rel@@ o@@ aded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can still take a very long time and load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see a further example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner . you can see the scanning art@@ ef@@ acts created by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel makes it possible to remove Hot@@ pixel pictures with a CCD camera gem , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel @-@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image extraction method . currently there is no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD failures .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter using the current settings . poor pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then , select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a one @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long expos@@ ures . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can not even illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead , quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( shad@@ y ) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that the sensor arrives there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 for aper@@ ture filters , which may cause the necessary closing time in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since there are otherwise blu@@ r effects caused by motion .
with the wide range of exposure areas of today &apos;s film and the gra@@ y@@ scale of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter . the tool vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection Filter and with three more exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of intensity damp@@ ing at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with a aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or accidentally a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
contrast and G@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction decreases the brightness of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , as you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the inser@@ tion correction to a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treated the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third gra@@ dient has a similar round effect , but flat@@ ters at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth grade correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second graph . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be eliminated almost .
in general : this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the reverse side of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and results in a correction first degree . negative values increase while positive image size decreases .
bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values improve them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the pitch or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before any change or size changes . best perform this correction as first . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a barrel @-@ like correction the effect would appear obvious to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the se@@ ash@@ ore or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Trans@@ forming C@@ utting from image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects such as pictures from the front , frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture can be seen in ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview , you can adjust two parameters of film gra@@ ining and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the Fü@@ ge Film Acqu@@ isition option if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared films , especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos since the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver particles of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grains effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photographic , gra@@ iny spectacle specifically in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance as an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
the top sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide picture is 1 and smoo@@ th@@ 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sketch . the lines that define the outlines in drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 in order to control this effect . the upper control sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter Grav@@ ure shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; filter Grav@@ ure is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in images with a simple structure in which color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ver filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 , the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blu@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ fe : bl@@ urs the image along the star @-@ shaped lines that focus on one focus . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distance sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back into the background .
motion picture : bl@@ urs the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : taken from a car or train , camera .
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and glossy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urs the image by shifting the pixels and simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blu@@ r : finds the bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then re@@ builds it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects take long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing can hold a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can move it through mirr@@ oring or turning into the right orientation . the tools for this can be found in the Trans@@ forming Rot@@ ate or Trans@@ forming Scre@@ aming .
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re @-@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size change . select Change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Up@@ load buttons are used in the same way . each inser@@ tion for photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and then rel@@ o@@ aded later .
infl@@ ating a photo is very fast at what it does , but it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear default enlargement to comparison .
the trimm@@ ing of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . in order to cut a photo you just have to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be sc@@ anned out . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look like after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The C@@ tr@@ l button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog is retained .
depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait , the larger value of the height and the width of the width is always assigned .
cutting the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool Fol@@ lowing the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the combination help make it possible to hide aids so that you can put together your images better . these aids are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ leg rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonic tri@@ angles on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it dives in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational figure of 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is equal to 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the gold middle . a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden middle will provide more fluid aid lines when compos@@ ing a picture . these aids are listed below :
compared to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition results in the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . there should be something that direc@@ ts the eye to the centre of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that unlike harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not a tri@@ angular tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place on these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the Horizon@@ tal and Ver@@ tical View options can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your picture with the slider angle . the values on this slider are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot an image you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is to automatically cut the function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after the turn . please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle left upper : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image will be spar@@ ed a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double the effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get un@@ pleas@@ urable tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to ber@@ some it is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing .
a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and horizontal line is displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sc@@ aling tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is bl@@ urred a bit . for a single shot this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sha@@ vings generate twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the painting , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF under it .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that are familiar with . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it is displayed &amp; digi@@ kam ; the file in the image editing pane . you can change this list of file extensions . see section Con@@ figuration for more information .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss @-@ free if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tut@@ orials in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ kam . this supports more than 200 raw file formats . all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the website of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
this clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; understands these formats and will generate preview for the movies . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editor and has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit films . if you click on a movie file , use the &amp; k@@ de ; Settings for playback of movies use to launch the program for playback .

many tools you need the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ kam ; their description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft@@ marks , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a consistent dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applied ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
divide vertically without dup@@ lic@@ ating . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area .
divide vertically . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper section shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and disc@@ ard it on the part of the image you want to preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings of the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar properties display the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map finder based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the P@@ allets files installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders after files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described in the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor to there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is activated by the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode Over@@ write is selected .
a selection created in this way as described in the last section can be used to copy , cut and paste along with the actions .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character if another color follows . if three numbers are placed in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot ; graphics ; graphics are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs ; programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; -@@ Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dot ; graphics ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; the graph re@@ counts and is in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; cate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; graphics viewer ; in an &amp; cate ; component
load large graphs ( currently there are problems starting at around 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph .
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only open the icon file and open the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right by pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can also mem@@ ori@@ ze your decision , so that later it will be used . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings ... use , see also .
if you open a graph@@ ite file outside of a running &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new and graphic viewer ; or want to display the loaded graph in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog .
when starting the program , you can let all graphs of your last session open again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which come to a page , should be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph@@ ene distributed across multiple pages without head@@ line and with another font
page Rest@@ ore Store gives you the ability to specify behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or request the program each time .
opening the page opens the possibility to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the session management page gives you the ability to set the start behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be prompted at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; opens further possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries , as they are described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z web page , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directional graphs . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato algorithm is the default for non @-@ generated graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a boun@@ ce @-@ spring model for und@@ ated graphs . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm direc@@ ts the node circular to according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms provide special options , or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for rendered graphs ) .
if this option is checked , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse cur@@ sor , click a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help on this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source file &apos;s base folder .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; program which uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for representation . it requires the following programs :
a special device is not necessary to use and graphics viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool bar , the tool@@ bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the color palette and the grid , in which you draw the icon .
create a new icon . if the current file has been changed , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears in which you can choose to create the icon from a template , or if you want to start anew from scratch .
restore the last undo step . if you do not have made a step back , this function is disabled .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current icon in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can create colors that do not correspond to those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ;
does not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color to the color of the point on which you click .
the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right you can see the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; Set up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and tool@@ bars .
with the buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc ;
choose Transpar@@ ent pixels or display rulers and set one @-@ color : or a chess board as transparency indicator . you can also adjust the size for the ch@@ ess@@ board : the car@@ os on small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module loading images provides tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or any other source such as Video streams . to make this work you must have installed K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e .
when you open the menu item pictures , a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . here , select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears to replace the default duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the Scan@@ nen button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , bottom corner .
make sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the scan button , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window for setting the image file options appears . please remember that type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ; you will need to save or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the Im@@ ports &gt; screen shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen@@ shots :
select the complete desktop to read in to read a single window under the mouse .
if All your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will be able to read the currently visible work@@ space .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you have to switch to other working surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot is made , the dialog options of the target image appear with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management online . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send photos to people who are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world , make photos of your camera phone online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be led through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication , so it is virtually your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser will be started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful login , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r Website . you will be presented the following page after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing &apos; Yes &apos; , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module exp@@ ires to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog indicating the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . for upload , you need write permission . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button Add Photo should be pressed once you have set all other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file cho@@ oser box . when you press the O@@ k button , upload the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server .
the Tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
with the Op@@ tional , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the access per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as Priv@@ at .
if you choose the Change option change the size of the photos before upload , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery ex@@ porting has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical location allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF keyword of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographical location module provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ relations . this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the dialog to see appears then . to perform a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one place for images , you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then click the cor@@ related button to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a series of photos in the same place . since the dialog contains the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . select the region in question and enlarge it . always check this again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be encoding U@@ TF @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab select allows you to select all albums that want to be exported to HTML . the tab selection allows you to select all albums to be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the preview and the text displayed in the header of the HTML page will be displayed .
the Ap@@ pear@@ ance tab defines the general look and layout for each page . the option For each image create a page creates a gallery where each image also gets its own page . if you click on a picture , a new page opens in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default viewer , eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ,
the tab record defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery . press close to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse clicks . it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below , without the usual losses of quality and metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size rises , because no compression of the color information takes place . this can also be found in the P@@ NG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata field , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work for all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual pictures you can add a basic image transition . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV to slide .
all images will be automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium .
you must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . afterwards , you can create the module via Extras m@@ peg Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images selected by you are listed under picture files in the portfolio . there you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your schedule , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , but a high , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the m@@ peg output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can now start drinking a coffee with the button coding . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go quickly or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide when you are back .
if a critic appears that codes or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages via the button settings right below .
the print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing gi@@ mp . this is for example : useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view Pre@@ view , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option will decide whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image afterwards .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format , as it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re @-@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image . for this purpose four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change of size in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
preparation : prepare the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window with the images you have pres@@ elected will be displayed . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview of the right @-@ hand side will be displayed .
you can also drag images to the list of images and drop them there to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button pictures remove the selected pictures from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the pictures you can open the New message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are already attached as attachments .
do not make sure to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the P@@ NG format below menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted from loss@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG in image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original exposure data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is completed , the window will not automatically be closed so that you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow a window appears asking questions about how to display your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file name option will show that the file name of the images is displayed in the left lower corner of the presentation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option of choosing images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album .
the time interval between the images can be set between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should check this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , every transition between the images sel@@ ects another effect .
during slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I mailing list at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. At@@ tention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse through them , see the picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group keyword records .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have given your images and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described .
when you press the mouse over the entry , the browser view changes . see picture .
when you select another person , only the images on which both persons are shown are displayed . by this selection method , you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person a thumb@@ nail image , this is also true for places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture for this .
in order to display images next to the name , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must select which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you will need to open the picture @-@ view window ( in more detail ) and show in the context menu the entry Categories Editor . here you can customize the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you visit the Search entry in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the picture .
if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description , the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched after this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can either be part of the total file , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all the images according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out similar features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog choose the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . ther@@ eu@@ pon some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can change between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( when you select a date , the first image will be displayed in the preview page ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate to preview .
you can also select a area of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , only images of that time frame will appear in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the menu file HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each section is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the revision and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select if you want to create a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file that is to be seen on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML pages . this way you can avoid that information is displayed without a description . for example , that all images are displayed by a party . note that all images are exported at the moment . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can browse your images with a low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image bigger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
it is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a supported protocol , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if these are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created . the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . so that the import function , see , properly works , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that are just described have all three related to the base folder and / or URLs . in them , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have spent a great deal of time recording the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not be done again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file itself or if only a link to images is stored in the file . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can have all the images together and share this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , Cre@@ ate . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you have provided when creating the HTML files are searched . this is only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access through the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are three choices available :
in the Manual located near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally slide into the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do this anyway , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Import menu ... , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders to import images to be copied .
it may be that you name the category individuals of the im@@ porting file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is in your database people . therefore , in the third dialog box you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and what categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and watch pictures : if you look at images , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will see the various steps from ( 1 ) laying the information about your images , via ( 2 ) viewing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , such as Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want to .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder in which your images are stored and automatically re @-@ use it in future launches . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings .
on the left you see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , all members of a group at one time in a group , instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; its module system communic@@ ates with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ kam and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules from multiple applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is why you should first test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures The &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can be accessed either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or through the menu Help .
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications re@@ arrange their pictures in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates order for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply fits the current view , so all images that you see at the moment the picture preview .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has to be released ; the modules also have a list of albums .
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be used in the category you specified in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category individuals , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album will do so , so if you had selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules are not compatible with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , see above a menu bar and tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window to browse your image database . currently , it does not contain very much information as you do not yet have information about your images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted in the image where the image was taken , etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were recorded .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving the images inside the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people are depicted , you can , by the fact that the names used are moved up , the persons can find and assign them faster .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting symbol by date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click the front and back buttons below the preview of the picture to the top right .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it may be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the US . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
in the picture , you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a sub@@ group . to show you that it is a sub@@ group , a special icon will be displayed .
in the context menu of the Com@@ ment Dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub @-@ category of this entry . attention , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it out of the window pane .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which , among other things , offers you the opportunity to save the current setup and look of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to get this window again later , use the Options ... and then turn the window / hide . this process is shown in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images in case you don &apos;t have a filter . an example for this can be found here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be created as background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it will be shown in the picture viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview window . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the delete button or select Edit Sel@@ ection from the Edit menu . now the window will show you that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it offers a solution for this problem . you can also use it with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also have the images stored somewhere , thus &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the pictures you need can be uploaded from the hard drive .
images where the right upper corner is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can show you the preview of these images . however , you can also not view these images with the picture viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and re @-@ copy files . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you want to avoid h@@ ass@@ le , how to avoid mess@@ ing up your pictures , please buy a larger disk to save all images on it .
in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those you want to make for others un@@ appro@@ ach@@ able and click Rec@@ ent View in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister can see , and choose the menu entry Every@@ thing out of the current view .
this allows you to determine which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item pictures lock , which prevents all images that you have locked . if you want to get the pictures again , click lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change your password in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand all images on the hard drive and on the other hand can read out or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to f@@ end the view of private images .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason has &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; about a picture _ and video viewer . these can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info box on the top part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure which information will be displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will display suitable entries for this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the keys Picture high and Picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the entire space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can drag in and out into the image . to zoom in , you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the plus button zo@@ oms in in the middle of the picture . shows the zoom @-@ rect@@ angle and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point @-@ key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the power button sets the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ atic operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key .
rotate the image from the context menu . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view the Canc@@ el and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you might prefer to mark the image and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the corresponding letters . in view , you will see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set the features on your pictures , they are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you are editing , printing or whatever you have selected , just add all of them at once . this is described in detail . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you will be allowed to paint it on the picture .
the batch will not be saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can reverse your gem@@ on later .
in order to finish the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the pop @-@ up menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not complete , but documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ mod@@ al views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or choose a menu item in the menu In@@ sert .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will appear , so that you can select the right position :
by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right @-@ click context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have modified the properties , click Apply to Apply this Chan@@ ges . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can rec@@ tify the input errors and click Apply and disc@@ ard the changes .
when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture will be rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ menu item ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check local .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can move these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need another arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or below a view , pull the An@@ f@@ asser to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the p@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to order multiple views over one another , pull the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to lo@@ osen a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , pull the p@@ asser @-@ down on the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the panel bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the side@@ bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them in any place .
the current window view can be saved with view window ordering ... saving . it will display a dialog where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View View@@ ing Sc@@ ene .
a render mode matches the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes as you like from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the View menu View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the frame of the picture to render into the input fields .
in the quality drop down sel@@ ector you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering used . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection illumination . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User &apos;s Guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling corresponds to the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because every pixel is constantly divided further and adap@@ tively because the depth of the rec@@ ur@@ sion depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray uses a ray for each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the values exceeds the threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch on j@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last adjustment for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have not hit the object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly termin@@ ates , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray player , select the File Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet complete command set of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this will add the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , it will open and post @-@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . here the path to your document and the version . supported are the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height @-@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene file , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the scope of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects , such as the ball , you can set the level of detail for two directions separately .
if you tick the high level of detail for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
if you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you tick the floor , a floor underneath the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window instructions . in the window instructions section , you will find how to create and store window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created by pressing the Add button and del@@ eting a selected order with the Del@@ ete button .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created using the Add button and del@@ eting selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
the position of the new window . with New column create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a map picture view together with the previous view and floating anchored the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere at a level .
but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ post @-@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Edit Del@@ ete . this way you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . when you click on it , see the object &apos;s contents in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points in view with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
when you apply the user button or push button , the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you will see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert fin@@ ite bodies qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the user button or the input button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the plane , even at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane stretches to the horizon .
when you view the object tree carefully , you will notice that you can fold the item for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the settings in the object &apos;s view .
in this scene , you should move the floor to the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select a shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but in the moment choose something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub @-@ object . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with one click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and sphere in the preview , just click the Apply button and preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your picture right now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . select the color list entry in the object tree . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the Object tree , choose mon@@ ochro@@ me each time and change colors in the object &apos;s view :
you should be able to do this step by step , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input key or the user button ) so that the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit down .
of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , set a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
choose the Most Sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click Ball Pig@@ ment , then dial Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click Apply or press En@@ ter .
the brightness effect and reflection already result in very good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options you can &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en the rendering of hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like fog affect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
open a file . in default file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you still have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the recently revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Rec@@ ently .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ ride an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option set @-@ in short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog for setting up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers with this option ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to simulate harsh surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give color to a pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can click on &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set if any image should be displayed in your own window , or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing En@@ ter or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog setting up - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other short commands for the display window and short instructions for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the pictures will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opening &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider resp@@ . the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider resp@@ . the small arrows on the right of the input field .
here the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no longer browser window is opened .
show the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show photo ; is an &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ Picture ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and requests . all the information you need is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers will help each other . if you are a more common user of &amp; show photo , then we would like to encourage you to answer any other users of &amp; show photo ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate &amp; show photo ; to participate is to join the developer mailing list . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show photo ; .
&amp; show photo ; tries to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that modify the behavior of &amp; show photo ; to access these settings , you need to set up the settings show@@ photo ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you should display . under@@ exposure should show a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view the same side@@ bar in the image processing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer do as images to scan and save .
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and save . &amp; gu@@ inea ; can open a dialog for saving each image or store the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this website : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; gu@@ inea ; using the command channel -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner you want to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; kiss .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not address these options in particular .
to scan a picture , the user can start a preview can and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed then the image will be saved and reflected ? en will lead to a demo@@ lition and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialogue with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the Save preview option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way you want to save images . open the dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored at the Save without after a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it by button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images and is also the proposed name for the image in the Save dialog . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is up @-@ numbered each time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also alters compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE assistance with the &amp; gu@@ inea ; manual . the button Over ki@@ cks the K@@ DE over -@@ Dialog for &amp; gu@@ inea ; . the button settings displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to exit &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; to finish .
&amp; gu@@ inea ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ci@@ ane library used by &amp; gu@@ inea ; under L@@ GP@@ L . caution : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these abbrevi@@ ations and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts you can set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and selecting Global short@@ cuts . you can set up the key short@@ cuts by right @-@ clicking in the player window and select short@@ cuts ... .
you may set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this will make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
Amar@@ ok &apos;s D@@ CO@@ P interface has many general functions , most of which are also found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script whether all the required modules are available and use the dialogue so that the user knows why a script does not run .
begin require &apos;@@ Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ Deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ screen --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the base for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow execution of external programs and commands . in most cases the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events if there is no use for them .
configure Wei@@ st uses the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ folder to the folder where all data should be saved .
track@@ Planet indicates that a new piece is being played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece can be retri@@ eved ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume displays a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add an entry you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; exit , or if the user stops a script , send &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly identify the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is complete , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ end . for your entry to k@@ de @-@ apps , you should use the Amar@@ ok Categ@@ ory ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus . you might also search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
perhaps you already have a few play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if you still find it hard to choose , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is smart , sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music anew !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have trouble when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compilation options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . for details , see the System requirements section .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to the playlist window , only the play@@ lists window is displayed when the option is disabled .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar support . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
create atmospheric : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar support . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
put mood files in the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar support . if enabled , .@@ mood files will be stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s settings folder ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when saving , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you exit .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
keeping the current piece visible when changing the piece causes the playlist window to roll up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area .
switching to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is part of three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting your own fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray presented section will be activated . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : play@@ lists window , Player window and context browser . press Select ... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can define your own color scheme . use the color selection for foreground and background color to be activated .
resume playback will cause &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback will continue automatically with the piece in place with which it has been stopped at the last stop .
setting up the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when using On @-@ Screen @-@ Display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog box the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas will open the color selection dialog . if your own colors are not enabled , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen a multi @-@ screen environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the Audio Output Fol@@ der Card lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers still activate more settings in this card .
the card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up , how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively browse sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
over@@ see changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( for example , if music files are added or deleted ) . an incre@@ mental search is also performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is required .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Linux , the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located will be entered under port : the network port is entered under which the database is accessible .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the card@@ boards last@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations for the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and refresh the profile : this option allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to submit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
refer to the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you have to install k@@ deli@@ bs so ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager holds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but Flu@@ x@@ box will work hard . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by checking ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and recre@@ ate the collection .
this is mostly due to the fact that tag@@ lib is abnormal when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a little more mature .
make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable ATM when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least use no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail opens automatically when a crash occurs ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the Met@@ a @-@ Infos , but do not mark this as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s Symb@@ ols in the status bar ( Rand@@ om mode / repetition / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are simply forgotten .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any colli@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems are solved easiest by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also look for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please only make a mistake there if you do something about fixing a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the interface intuitive , the start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the list box of the playlist and select column view rating . click anywhere in the new review column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select from Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist with your mouse and let them fall there just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the addition button , is the playlist Save Play@@ list . click on it .
probably you lack the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach so the real question must be Which media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 de@@ coding is included in the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to pass audio simultaneously . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or via the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another sink ( eg . sink ) .
that &apos;s what &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first de@@ code . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound &amp; multimedia sound system settings . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :

either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the quicker Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less carriers respond to visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , it crashes down &amp; Amar@@ ok . why ?

read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok earlier ! ) : - Download the m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute the n@@ m@@ peg file again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report this to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / requests , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you wake up by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
if a working SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and User@@ name with your User@@ name . this assumes that your identification is in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , res@@ izing window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + privileges mouse button places a piece in the queue string in the queue . pressing the input button after a search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .

if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes resulting in a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably need to install a distribution that has the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same is true for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you must compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I consider the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix this ?

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
set up audio output under settings Amar@@ ok ... output audio output . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 } &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib calls for conversion of sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box with sound card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with arts will not be taken care of . you can naturally take this issue into your hands ! if you want , you can become the new ( so much needed super@@ visor for Arts ) : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason there is the setup wizard that is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to upgrade your collection later or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier for you to search for certain pieces . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save them by pressing the button of the playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , you &apos;ll find these play@@ lists already in the tree view .
to play an audio CD , please select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with several folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the Play button .

this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; be used , including the creation of a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red playing time for the remaining playing time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch from the available Analy@@ zer by right @-@ clicking on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , enlar@@ geable window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are located under the running text display . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up E@@ quali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume . playback / stop playback and switch to the next or previous part using the playback buttons .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that it does not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be shared in two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right , you find the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser shows different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window is dropped off . the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window Music displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng will be treated prefer@@ enti@@ ally . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will play immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can specify which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be worked out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , &amp; Amar@@ ok tries to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if there is still no text script running , you can choose which one should be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - only group the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . records or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are sorted by artist and there@@ under will be a further seg@@ mentation after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ts by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be displayed first by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes for using this filter can be found in the section about the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter is a selection field , with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . of course , you can also select your complete collection , which allows the filter to be switched off practically .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - This will emp@@ ower the current playlist and add the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order .
attach to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry , you will achieve the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue . this will play next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as play@@ lists . you &apos;ll be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer to Media Player - Add the tracks into the queue for transferring to the Media Player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser .
burn all pieces of this performer / Bur@@ n on CD - This will send the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and either burned as data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces .
move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the compilation - select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
picking up a compilation @-@ marking - changes the album marked as a compilation back to a normal album . afterwards the album will no longer be shown under different interpre@@ ters but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes use of many play@@ lists very easy . among other things , it also contains Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these are used &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even created Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists are possible . click Intelligen@@ te playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player &apos;s browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the performer list . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the disk connection for your iPod .
there is a search area under the tool@@ bar that allows you to search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because all the files in the file list are hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ c@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press input button , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be tri@@ cky by simply dropping files . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse to the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . if you enter for example one two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you type OR between the search terms OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example all pieces contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then include the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : review : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign ahead of the search term : -@@ something is searching for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include a comment bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by holding the C@@ tr@@ l key pressed , and then right @-@ click on the entries in the desired order . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button , which you can add to the play@@ lists .
next , the buttons follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool bar is a unique , larger analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu like that which you get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars ...
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . in addition , the status of shu@@ ffle mode and retri@@ eval , a sli@@ pping tool for the play@@ time position and the playing time of the current play is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist .
a click on this entry opens the window Visu@@ alization plu@@ gins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover management . select :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , a number appears in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will play first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , of which two are pre @-@ given ( the details to set up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds more random pieces during playback .
add pieces based on Last@@ s.@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio @-@ ac@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that you already have some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on you and then select store . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set modes of Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix instantly fill in your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces starts with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as starting point .
the New Edit button adds up to the current playlist and adds new songs according to the dynamic mode . edit Play@@ list will open the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right click on a dynamic playlist gives you the ability to click Edit . this opens the dialog to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ignored and they will not hear twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed with respect to the setting of pla@@ ym@@ ate ch@@ un@@ ks .
plays - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which songs have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each play . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings are already described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists and smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry appears in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X audio en@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ MAC : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful e.g. for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the CD &apos;s base folder .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can choose folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for every single project file .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and still not saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen , you can choose between saving and modi@@ fying the project . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the CD &apos;s base folder .
this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium , the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is that ? -@@ Rem@@ edy ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD @-@ Project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you create files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is more likely to be used for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders existing on the media .
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD @-@ Project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to create a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a DVD , which will then burn you later . in addition , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of the copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to capture the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW disk .
with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , so the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously created CD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burn button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the button of the button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used single @-@ sided . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is ti@@ cked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and unlock the disk or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the table of contents allows selecting and dra@@ gging files in the project view . the table of contents is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD was selected in the folder view .
the head bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key mapping to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; quot ; applications also , equipped with an &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the more comfortable program k@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive in deciding which of the programs you prefer .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following to the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void format@@ .d@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ .d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ Method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface listed above and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL : : c@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders , and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ seek@@ er ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ seek@@ er ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many en@@ co@@ ders that en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( compressed ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ye c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) is supported by default ( These coding packages must still be added from the Linux distribution ) . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ seek@@ .@@ c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if it is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other en@@ co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions . however , only the encoding packages must be installed that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ zer gives a small introduction to coding , audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying a protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ video@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoids the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of copying protection . simply avoid buying a copy protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be inv@@ oked so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , then the daily handling is explained on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you can often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is manually captured .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step , for example , you &apos;ll find more information about how this program is used , and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the program configuration .
start CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the set up request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established . )
start reading and - when an en@@ coder has been configured in the Code encoding settings in the setup d@@ ashboard - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection with another en@@ coder can be read as the default . note that before the en@@ coder was configured in the encoding settings in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read out and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ate ) .
opens the main dialog of &amp; co @-@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like en@@ co@@ ders , for setting up the en@@ coder ) . here you need to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right en@@ coder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences are less important , since both en@@ co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be included free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing equipment is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate around 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music from youths , portable devices and car stereo equipment . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information which is manually entered or fet@@ ched through the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ seek@@ er ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the en@@ coder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ co@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; adding titles to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; co @-@ creator ; parameters needed ( = knob of a button in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter the information so that all the others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translation : this is meant by the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ seek@@ er ; is actively using a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the e @-@ mail address is not used when fet@@ ching the data from the server ( but only the programmer may know who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if it is set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates to the database .
which read@@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that you will use c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; if you want to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see that you have to install the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution first if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
to save the read WAV files , the en@@ coder and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ye c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on this tab .
the co@@ di@@ zer package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined en@@ co@@ ders . more information about co@@ di@@ ers can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a coding , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio coding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ye c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; read out . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine since it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg by trying to copy something in it ) .
the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; co @-@ creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the code to be used to compression the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them on every reading of a &amp; CD ; if once the matching settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ dates / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM can be displayed ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is loaded / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only if you have incomplete information , select so that you will be notified when information on creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected during reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with a low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind that if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in the offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls are bu@@ cking the protocol 88@@ 80 , maybe there is more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to transfer data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . to disable the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time at just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , please tick this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the box is not enabled , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
type everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is approx . 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the compression factor achieved is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for restric@@ ting tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneously coding WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we just have the basic set up of &amp; co @-@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change them again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was built in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually input data instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will indicate the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , now the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , please consult the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window created , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually invo@@ ke this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the internet , you will need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : CD @-@ Editor - Input the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; field , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ al per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; on audio creator ; maximum allowed .
you can later modify the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all en@@ co@@ ders or file formats . see Help to the Ko@@ di@@ ver to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the ending CD ; in this example , this is not important since we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . please enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title dates of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the BO@@ M .
note that there is a check sign before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
has been started by clicking on the selection button selection of the selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab order to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right below the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you can see this error if you try to work with a code that you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded have been marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it &apos;s clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , out @-@ reading and coding parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is placed in the queue of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window with a message for a short time appears in the upper left part of the window .
if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you will need the en@@ coder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ seek@@ er ; today , you can download CVS as part of the c@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ seek@@ .com . if you are reading this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different card flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any c@@ lue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ seek@@ er ; it is intended to do so . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and agrees with this proposal .
strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need those informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke game player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others it also features real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window on k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session support . when you quit playing a song , mid @-@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played sequ@@ enti@@ ally . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template and change the speed of playback . to get back the original tempo , double click the speed LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a print affects the space bar like a print on the button Pause or the selection of the menu entry break in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , start &amp; k@@ mid ; play .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text events , others use lyrics , and others use both . some pieces do not have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events should be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically calculated , which uses a song so that you don &apos;t have to manually set up the kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to set a certain type of event , select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Text &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summari@@ ze . in this section you can see how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the collection under the item Organ@@ ise .... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . in the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the one you want in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . keep in mind if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song using the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening ( using file opening or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then add the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removal .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order , as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , the next song entry from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to boun@@ ce back a song , select the button Previous piece , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the key arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , as it is not saved when leaving &amp; mid ;
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano series into events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , which will always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need a MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards GM are -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we and G@@ us cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all necessary re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the keyword section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A more key map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , you can specify how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the right side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you can not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all the sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun fire .
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term Tro@@ mmel patch the patch is meant , where each sound represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ary instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one at which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple keywords for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key@@ maps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel . take a look at the included key maps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and the second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on Channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map must be defined further forward in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio speci@@ fies in which ratio pitch @-@ benefit events are multip@@ lied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM says that a keyboard that receives a pitch benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 should play a note higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards are trying to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try playing around .
to use a MIDI @-@ Map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ anos you see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button no longer appears green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the Channel View menu : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files separately .
accept , therefore support &amp; k@@ mid ; Dra@@ g &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
first , enable automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have an &amp; K ; Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window open with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or started ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or when I want to play a file , simply switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; move windows and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn the automatic add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
suppose you have the MIDI files A@@ mid , B.@@ mid , and C.@@ mid@@ . First you only want to play the first file . so , set the automatic add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ G. and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much spare time for my hob@@ bies but I try to take a bit of time .
if you would like to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard from your home town or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will list with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; however , before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me since I may have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money for it . I would therefore like to emphasize that I only get more programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also is Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the web , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can track the development , search for information and look at images . you can also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound@@ card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you cannot of course hear any music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from the formats supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE site for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window with the playlist .
it is possible to save the preferred links from the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played by one another , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the attached entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can also be changed by an editor . by clicking on a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , select Play@@ list from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , so the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation may be displaying a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c , like setting up the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even include the special box em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module must be specified as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file As@@ sets of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and after error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order for a given back@@ end to be taken for a particular mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is as@@ cer@@ tained ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c . for example , Phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be seen , you need to use the device to be used and the TV channels . to do this , you can use the scanner from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port is to be used . there , ports should be detected , of which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
as the V@@ DR support from K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presumably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
this is the dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when enabled , they start playing the playlist .
are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be run as root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is needed to compile and compile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems , it is likely to be applied to the pack@@ et &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the box should be made .
if you have any questions or if extensions are comp@@ iling ; on or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . in addition , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the possibility to complete , compile , post @-@ edit and error search within the source code as well as conversion and viewing tools for this .
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual of Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to operate , a lay@@ man can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it comes from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do so . to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other mark@@ up languages include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction showing the general features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ start { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start As@@ sist of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . it can also be done with some settings related to the document .
document classes : this allows the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projections &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projections &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this sets the character encoding . it should use the character encoding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( compl@@ ying with the German DIN regulations ) .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . they are just a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; Ki@@ le , it is likely that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is likely to be spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ start { command } ) of &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the lock of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into several elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex files . once a DVI file is created , &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and to print out DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
if the search string is used , the elements of the DVI ; file are used with the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked into the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked , the corresponding position is displayed in the DVI ; viewer .
master @-@ document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master @-@ document , work with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings .
quick Construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is to be held in the same way and there is no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction .
when viewing the Edit tool bar , the three large selection boxes should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick introduction of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the fast structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection box Fur@@ ther is for inser@@ ting items such as tags , notes notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : this command creates a name for a section , a picture or a different element .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( select a selection field ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written nat@@ ely also in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ emp@@ ower is used for the definition of the let@@ tering . it can be used to specify the font documents for the main text , notes notes , etc . the following font documents are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le , there are two choices available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ will contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s building or the quick construction .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using fast construction should &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the let@@ ter@@ box e 12 is created and only a few things should have a different font .
the changes are only checked inside the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes in an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold printing , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the document .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or other environment . a single word in a set can be shown itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; drawing language was presented , then follow a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a little text is entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . at least a quotation , a few passages in bold and ital@@ ics and a poem should be applied to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor again ( with the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ ering ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step , after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed using File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into woven other formats can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the search query allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ ding files . only Modern under Settings box ... Tools should be selected .
in order to complete the search query , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on for preview search . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is then made .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; box ; open and set to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ( setting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
should an error occur when using quick build up of the &amp; DVI ; if an error is present , it will be shown in the log file or in the message box .
the log file indicates the error source in the source code . in the editor , the buttons of the Previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and other La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between the errors . the log file always speci@@ fies the line in which the error appears . to view the incorrect line , click on the error in logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template for the document to be used . the default options are :
when choosing a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section below .
users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a new document , some strings may be replaced with other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in the box ... Settings General .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files . if a simple way is used to create a template , one should search for one on the Internet and follow the steps described above .
&amp; cate ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; kate ; can be made directly in the menu .
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual of Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be called via the help of La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; can be used as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , if you click on \ \ par of \ \ big@@ skip only \ \ par is selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse and highlight the different kinds of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can include additional jump marks . these are an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the men@@ ue edit jumps or the corresponding ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes make the jump to the next or the last jump @-@ mark . this is also highlighted by this jump @-@ mark , so that it automatically is deleted at the first entry of a sign .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; kate ; already offers excellent possibilities , have been added to &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; and therefore supports &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Sel@@ ection , the following commands are included in the text selection :
he@@ als a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning is not meant by tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is that the ab@@ sc@@ esses are separated by two blank lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also reads &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; kate ; provides the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands for faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; it is included in the description to edit paragra@@ phs .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit surroundings for a better simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , skip to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , skip to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the closing of the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , skip to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering multiple associated environmental commands , you can quickly get the overview over . this command en@@ closes the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
with this command , skip to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , skip to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the buck@@ ling clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is located in front or behind the sh@@ red@@ ded clip of an &amp; tex group # , the group will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups of par@@ enth@@ eses , it is possible to get lost in overview quickly . this command en@@ closes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex , groups is not destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple quotes are used as go@@ g@@ gles . for the purpose implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &apos; for two simple quotes &apos; is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and provides two complete quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic double @-@ entry sign can be set up under Settings Box ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
you can also use specific settings ( e.g. German or French ) , so that German or French suits can be used . there are also many other languages available .
when shifting from shift ; input key for &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is in a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
complete with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added to the box ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to achieve this . in case of shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line .
although &amp; kate ; already offers a good source code complete , this has been extended in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic adaptation . all these modes can be set for different ways under Settings box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely adjusted .
at the beginning a new environment is added by the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for text ) .
when you click the back button , the last letter of the entry will be removed and this will allow you to delete the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by typing a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump handles can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing ho@@ ck marks and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Com@@ pre@@ h@@ ensive options can be made to these lists . it can be used to select different clock lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as opening of the general language used .
command mode is not useful for the complete damage of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin and the calling of the complete destruction mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for complete damage to environments .
when calling the complete stop mode over the menu Edit Ver@@ ily environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment automatically starts and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le , realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set up ... Ki@@ le ; Com@@ pre@@ h@@ ensive options can be made to these lists . this mode uses the board list of complete destruction mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of read@@ outs , which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... Ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , contains the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word complete change mode over the menu item C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Sp@@ ac@@ eb@@ ar , the character L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
big W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ books are not helpful for automatic complete registration . however , it has been found that many people in a document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the complete compensation for all written wishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can be set in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Set &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Complete fence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; here , even the threshold for displaying the complete damage can be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / personal home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( trun@@ cation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the graphics form the input of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphic formats , the sections should be considered and considered .
PS -@@ files are not as popular as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and re@@ arrangement of pages . if the PDF output is specified , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
in order to examine the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all the tools are group@@ wise in the menus to compile , create , and create view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer and ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used with Alt ; 2 using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the quick construction command , a viewer is usually called after the compile . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is about the project New Project ... Here you will find the following information for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ ob@@ r project file .
the Script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed on scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; they are delivered with many documents , including a documentation for the packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete operating manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; cases ; delivered documents and a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is searching for package names or banners . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results will be displayed .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphic editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface , you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , an arbitrary signature is extracted from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . through many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your emails varied and unique .
for day signatures the same signature is extracted from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this gives you a new signature ; empty signature ; and in the lower section enter your new signature . signature @-@ example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org When you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file Save or click on the Save disk icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , first select it and then in the File menu Rem@@ ove or click on the symbol with the red cross remove in the tool@@ bar .
to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the User Defin@@ ed button on the bottom right corner and enter the new short selection by pressing the key or key combination .
for use of &amp; k@@ gs ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation has known me and how outstanding it is . if we raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application is expected to be inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the popular work folder , then let the current work folder be checked . if not , remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the other folder field .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time they are started .
as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for that .
if the just opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then just let the current folder be selected . if not , choose the current job folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then the current file is simply checked . if not , delete the check@@ box in the current file and select the file to be reviewed by other file - File selection .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ format@@ ted file is , click the Well @-@ Form@@ ed review selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .

the plug @-@ ins that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ stly , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly a little to do . this allows the plug @-@ in system to benefit immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the plu@@ gins in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plu@@ gins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plug @-@ in or a K@@ Part , we will start editing the plug @-@ in menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all included plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project involves several people in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of their own identity are important in terms of news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that takes a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the Event Con@@ figuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the Reci@@ pi@@ ent list . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to insert notes is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a commentary area followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ in@@ sensitive , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with regard to tags including code completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large / Low case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liter@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tags XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : upper@@ case / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags : when checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , it is inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
update start and finish day automatically : when enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacing of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting different types of files . by means of button Def@@ ault , def@@ aults can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created files or other ways than opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is sto@@ cked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is sto@@ cked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
set the default window settings back to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and / or mounting views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning message area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no longer .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the representation of par@@ ser knots in the document , can be set in details .
in the area of the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structural tree setting , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the updating of the tree can be opened automatically when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element is found in the current document .
the Ab@@ brevi@@ ations are group@@ ed in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid . this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause Ab@@ brevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
the plug @-@ ins can be administr@@ ated here . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a standard such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load Compon@@ ent in read @-@ only mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts generally refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , it will be possible to save the entry even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it will later be installed .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , the troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the non @-@ necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently , only one plug @-@ in is available that supports the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the options next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger @-@ Plugin in the drop @-@ down field , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default , when a project is opened , which requires a de@@ bu@@ gger , so in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ u@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a de@@ bug request is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is stopped , execution proceeds . if a request is given , the execution begins as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where it is checked incor@@ rectly in functions and include .
tells the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the statement and go to the next one as if there were not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog allows a variable to be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , adapt to your needs and how you can get better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exists in two types , family 1 , mark@@ up languages and family 2 , script languages or &amp; CSS ; s consist of two parts , tag and descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic tool@@ bars of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of the conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day . the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars enable quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of a write error .
tag Fol@@ ders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag Fol@@ ders bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but one element type about itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the method method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the day has an ordinary attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only happen once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in tag editor dialog and attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ing together the elements of a list . it can only happen once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; Note . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause leg breaks , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog above is in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; start the dialog and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , verification is only performed when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt;
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for at@@ tain@@ able via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Transi@@ tional 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... to be created . click New Action results in the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut added to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current short@@ cut is removable .
the simplest actions . it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the quick start dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in your path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we sub@@ stituted with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is sub@@ stituted with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , directed to the standard error output . it can be specified , what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the output field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case there are not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the Mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings menu .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
complete all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; complete all and if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , activate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog if available to allow input when using the action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics More programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note that the icon created does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually distributed as loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this symbol will be inserted ; -@@ tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol it must still be associated with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions specify ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to tool@@ bar or it should be shared in multiple groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators . open the tool@@ bar to set the dialog on Settings tool@@ bar . make sure the tool@@ bar you want is selected .
after selecting the element which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
after new XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust its &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that its tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded when a file is opened from the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you might be in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has already done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc / language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation , for example .
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the shaft depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; Note . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; scripts would display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of text @-@ separated context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your Do@@ cr@@ c file just after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then , create a folder ( as specified in your do@@ cr@@ c file ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation was used to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an U@@ E @-@ mail item input , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in Scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions will be checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and user @-@ friendly for publishing . in order to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked about their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one .
the upload can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plate and Scrip@@ ts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , resear@@ ches &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and sign@@ aling . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears indicating the source of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Download Menu and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file using the DT@@ D description to be used . after that , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type Defini@@ tions : the string that will appear in ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand them and to be able to gain full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them close to these concepts , without their understanding and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little useful .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the index cards with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click on the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area leads to another context menu on the edited document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse cur@@ sor , or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional is used as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; p@@ gt ; in their document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now , you can enter the data for that just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( such as ar@@ mature ) , you can fill in a dialog boxes .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate , open and ro@@ am information in the information . in the presentation with index cards , for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views are available .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project by right @-@ click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be carried out with the contex@@ tual menu displayed .
a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , parts of the program , a whole website &amp; etc ; All possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . global Tem@@ plates are always available , local templates are always available , local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ clicking of an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresh@@ ment of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can easily change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . its content @-@ oriented entry system allows changing all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two tab@@ s at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . thus , for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab displays all the errors in the up @-@ to @-@ date document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Scrip@@ ts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as compressed text archive on &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool bar in an email , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not execute here .
if you have problems starting with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PA@@ TH before its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE &apos;s surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML @-@ editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for it the appropriate &amp; IDE ; to be .
well , to the above claim must be kept that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why developing what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more details , see help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or run help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and served by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check in the section on templates . if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converted when past@@ ing from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; en@@ rol@@ ment so that they are properly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; en@@ rolling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the Anker tag .
switches the block selection to / from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; script exec@@ utes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message box or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
on and off the problem @-@ re@@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the column icons to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manage the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects you will find the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
create a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . it just creates the name . actions must be set up by setting actions ... saving tool@@ bars . tool@@ bars are stored by tool@@ bars tool@@ bars or you will be asked when you exit if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables upload tool bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; which has made you or anyone else and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; . is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML , ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu item in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current creation dialog if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu Tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar refuses to comply with the rules this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . clicking on an activated plug will de@@ activate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the type ; version .
select the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the switch can sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the index card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ windows mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting a entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
to@@ g@@ gles the status bar on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window to or from .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
depends on the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; for details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or add which ones and modify row sequences .
this should create a help in the context of the mouse cur@@ sor , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as e.g. after filling the project name the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name of the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be filled out automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and def@@ aults to templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . when a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or entire folders .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you would like to download and change . in case of ser@@ vers@@ ing scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
be checked if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is re@@ started from scratch , do not tick .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection of goo@@ dies .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hook @-@ up hooks or , by removing the tick , cl@@ ut@@ ching out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard comprises three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window Profile or with Shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the sub @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by h@@ opping up their own tree view for each profile .
in the Team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a particular event occurs , such as backing up a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project that was open . you cannot influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project or Symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave similarly , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the context menu calling the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button is displayed to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten by the user . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ load profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a full qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored in a veiled manner on the disk , so it is not easy to read , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give many views in one project , i.e. by simply sw@@ apping the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the project tool bar in the Project or Project Tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings tool bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are the best . use and add are different . adding tool@@ bars is discussed below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which you can remove other actions such as tool bar , ren@@ ame tool@@ bar , or set the tool@@ bar , which can be specified , which actions should be visible on this or other tool@@ bar .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions .. set .
templates are basically a common file system with enhanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in approximately the restrictions you imagine for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary Tem@@ plates are normally included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be created by any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specialized documents are made in appropriate sub@@ folders . a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area should always be included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl based . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate ....
once this has been done , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local / Project Tem@@ plate . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag &amp; drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used , such as drag and drop , or insert over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on the file tree or in the project files tree view on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can present head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or link dynamically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or associate with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
templates based on templates based in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is displayed as soon as par@@ ental attributes have been brow@@ sed .
this is enabled by default and fits all except for the regular folders in the Tem@@ plate menu . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building block . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably be in a root folder .
allows pres@@ et or introduced text for templates in this folder . this may be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows by copying contents into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p an entire presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
additionally , you can have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another by means of context menu ( click on it , press right mouse button ) .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be reached through the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back to source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document containing &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol displays the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ness of &amp; PHP ; source . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor , it is still necessary to edit the source text editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are both visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cur@@ sor is activated in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor is already active , ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , where the position in the document is maintained .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor can be adjusted via settings Qu@@ anta . depending on the choice of V@@ PL , you can select between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to the time span . basically , the recommendation applies : a small gap for fast computers and a large range for slow ones .
the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this is used to reduce the manual coding . this can be used to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows changing the contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ ling template by pressing the file open button and selecting the corresponding file .
the cur@@ sor is used as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves peculi@@ arly . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and using the return button or remove button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way as the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it should be noted that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags cannot be removed , e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded by text , must be removed any other ar@@ mature day .
some tool@@ bars like the tables wizard or the Listen @-@ Assistant are down@@ lighted . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be tra@@ cked .
to be able to compile succ@@ es@@ fully compile the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; cc@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g calcul@@ ates the full path from a file name without path . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , it is checked for partial or entire agreement with a template named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template is identical to any QNAP that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace specified in the named &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stop must be termin@@ ated for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically done when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stops are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

on systems with an installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll by using the arrow keys on / off by the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the commands previously executed .
several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass composite expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument , a holding point is set in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program used by me only showed the modified lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where maybe only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it in one of the comparison slots .
a function that made a lot of work was the compar@@ isons and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ value file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the resulting result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen shot shows three source files while mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in case of folder mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you frequently have to check codes , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make typing easier by using only the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder folder folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folders
the opening dialog allows for manual typing of file names , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list .
through the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders is introduced . if a file is selected for A , but for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field will be active and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to immediately set an output file . you can also do this later when saving .
the setting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog , you don &apos;t have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag &amp; drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the thought behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you only need to create two corresponding files , download them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at the moment , you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop @-@ down of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret drag &amp; drop of text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse take a while over the line . then a small help window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed by the settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see the color that differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare individual cases . )
the vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines . if the line break is enabled , the line of broken lines is scored .
the result window ( under the comparison window ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; when you edit the result . usually , it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to find the remaining / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two bench@@ marks are used , any difference is also a conflict of manually resolved .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black bar .
sometimes by automatic mer@@ ging or manually editing , there is no other line left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no row in the queue ; displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps choose another source again . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a mark you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy this text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the sources ignore the numbers or ignore the Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navigate is mainly using the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , up , down , page on , right , up , C@@ tr@@ l start and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you are used to by other programs .
in the editing pane , you can also use the other buttons for editing . using the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already explained in the section merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / final difference , the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture Ab@@ and@@ age ) or the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark to the cli@@ p@@ board , you have to press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and manual copying is om@@ itted . be careful with this option , as you may accidentally over@@ ride the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line @-@ feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line ends of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically at the end of the game and restored at the next start . ( setup Menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c font are shown . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be sc@@ anned . on these systems , the button Pre@@ ferences automatically introduces an un@@ format@@ ted color .
when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
if you press or return the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . copying the manual to the cli@@ p@@ board is not necessary .
you can choose which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step , white characters are ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only store a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the carriage return characters are made visible , however , like a white character . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . however , the differences are shown , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . comments in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in Automati@@ cally advanced mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will proceed .
automatically resol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu .
these options are discussed in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you must start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if this option is checked , the top setting will be used for all entries .
the encoding area for encoding appears to be a short indication of what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available when comparing three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second super@@ visor column with the information needed .
sometimes you &apos;d prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply select the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
classi@@ fies the comparison window next to each other or to each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then immediately decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your needs . you can use this function e.g. for removing disturbing parts or correc@@ ting the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users don &apos;t want to program it by themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for line calibration to convert entering capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre@@ processing command for line calibration . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi er@@ ased .
sometimes you might want to perform several compositions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever per@@ l some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre @-@ processor are retained for displaying and summari@@ zing . the other operations only change the data that the line ab@@ norm@@ ality al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the new@@ line processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that alters the text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adapt the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate mer@@ ging and displays the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialogue file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start mer@@ ging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed of a small message box about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed .
when scanning the folders is completed , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on + / - , or double @-@ click on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right .
when you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
for identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified , and if the option synchron@@ ize directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to allow both files to be identical afterwards . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged , selecting the newer file instead of mer@@ ging ( uns@@ af@@ e ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and displays the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. As long as these errors are not eliminated , mer@@ ging the folders cannot be started .
while mer@@ ging , one file is processed after another . status column shows Fer@@ tig when mer@@ ging has been successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
when a Full Analysis is selected in the setup dialog box , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the resolved conflicts column is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then you will use C as the target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der @-@ merge mode , B will be selected as the target and used for syn@@ cing A and / or B as a target .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check afterwards if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries , select / continue directory mer@@ ging / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( short@@ cut ) . to do only the current entry , select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid interaction actions , a message appears that indicates the er@@ ron@@ eous elements . they can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the options Browse , Del@@ ete and Canc@@ el .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( mer@@ ging a single file ) , a merge window will open ( note the screen shot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select Rest@@ ore / continue directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears .
if you want to continue mer@@ ging ( F@@ 7 key ) , a message will appear and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . this allows you to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , you will notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) will not work together again later . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ created files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this file system can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signature file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hiding attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous score sel@@ ects a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
for links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
if the option is turned on , the links will be compared to normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; does not result in possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is turned off in default .
the complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders to a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security .
similar to the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical when they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the chan@@ gel@@ ation date . please use caution . this option is dep@@ rec@@ ated in default .
enables synchron@@ ize mode when compared to two folders and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are identical afterwards . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is turned off in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file will be proposed as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another backup , then the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders .
normally , the folder view menu remains visible while mer@@ ging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the window and text windows option to turn off main windows in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . once you save the result , the status will be termin@@ ated and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should note :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , Space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # entered the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit any per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently as a discre@@ p@@ ancy viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; suppose the input file is a patch file in unified format . then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the pop @-@ up context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; executed as part , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s compact ) already exist . in addition , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this path or have to go this way .
you compiled the program from sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear next to each other , this is more and more often the case .
this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could save this information .
you can always recover a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c turns ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of the last changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , see more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have problems comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ oval ) copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marker .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options . )
only entries are displayed showing differences . this also causes identical files to not be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is turned off in default .
when you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , clicking on the button will be removed accordingly .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini preview of all virtual work@@ tops . it is quite convenient to view the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both within a working area and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ tops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other work@@ tops .
the contex@@ tual menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; p@@ ager , cli@@ cked , the contex@@ tual menu has only the two entries p@@ ager . when cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application , as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , View Desktop and Cover .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces .
if this field is selected , the name of the virtual work@@ space will be displayed in &amp; p@@ ager .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ tops . if it is selected along with name , the names will be marked with ord@@ inal numbers , eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is selected , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in &amp; p@@ ager .
if this field is selected , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty working areas will be displayed to enable their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the order of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classic lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N screen , as from p@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers , horizont@@ ally shows all virtual work surfaces in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying on the side on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display windows as symbols or with its content and move it . besides , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; p@@ ager ; and set up switch sel@@ ections ... let the dialog appear .
currently it is not possible to change settings in the dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must log in as user root and assign it to your system administrator .
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you will need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE basic pack@@ ets .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read the newspaper a magni@@ fier for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is intended for various users : this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly updated with new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you &amp; K@@ likes ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag , shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called magni@@ fying window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window in the following .
in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag , the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can create a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor setting . please note that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently it is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter into the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the Shift key or Shift + M@@ MB , you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window will remain firm and only move the lower right corner .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image to the printer , save it into a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
starts or stops the ad update . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and size &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use an area of the screen , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse @-@ click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains on the same spot . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse @-@ click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain . besides , it can em@@ ulate pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may also cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click once you stop the movement shortly .
move the mouse , wait until the end of the move , until releasing the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can drag the button with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; execute a mouse click .
when Intel@@ ligent Move is turned on , the shutter speed ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , wait until the mouse button is released when no moving of the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these moves are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slide control sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this option is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; starts . this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the relevant documentation to find out how to launch a program there automatically .
set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last push of the user .
in particular , the smart move should be turned off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first you should be aware of what places a click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rollers . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . you can scratch the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation no longer can stop by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you are using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and moving a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue exec@@ uting mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent move , but I do not manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely to mark text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart move if you are just starting to use k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . this allows you to use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; button the mouse cur@@ sor as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor moves away . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to be pressed .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time that a drag action begins before the mouse button is released . in this way the dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging can be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which mu@@ te users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , dum@@ my users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be re @-@ spoken .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command , which is later used for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can often choose text passages used without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) , you determine the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to allow only properly sp@@ elled words to be added to the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the sentences in the input field , which you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken once again .
with the Settings @-@ mouth menu entry , set up ... open the preferences dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output , and settings , the language supplement page as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the language edition , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop down box below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text passed to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed un@@ altered as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to add the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the Dic@@ t@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is reasonable even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down menu Action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passage book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant speaking , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added to the default memory . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered only into the input field .
the second drop @-@ down box allows you to specify whether the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
save the book if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . if you choose to retrieve edi@@ ts , it will be called &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be saved .
the language supplement page contains a list of words for the word completion . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop @-@ down field .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ . documentation . the frequency of each word is easily retri@@ eved by counting the steps . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option you insert a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the respective short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the default storage .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the default storage .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the default storage .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool bar is arranged by default via the editing window under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ click on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar for text passes with entries is displayed . the bar is by default arranged above the editing window under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ click on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for the speech output right or not completely . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the language edition . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
festival is a voice @-@ over@@ s system at the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently , it only supports English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the speech output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the speech output is then possible with one of the following three command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to break the text into phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to swallow the last character of the text so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
/ usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is an &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use the possible kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the preferences dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who cannot speak to print text by the computer . a list of already spoken phrases is stored , which the user can spend time and time again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer . on the computer a speech syn@@ thesizer has to be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found at help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or run help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .

in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ats ; subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility .
before you can use it , you need to install the program speech @-@ dispat@@ cher and set it right . see also :
on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card file spokes@@ man is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card file General will be shown . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or velocity . you should also set up multiple variations for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you are using it , since the program speed schedul@@ er otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different actors for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the tab card reader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card file spokes@@ man will be displayed . this will also automatically appear when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all already established speakers will appear in this list . the top speakers will appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not provide a speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
on one of these buttons , click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; Desktop system .
select here a tuning type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker appears on the voice card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can almost use it . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start &amp; k@@ de the language dispens@@ ing system . click on the tab General to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and remove the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when t@@ m@@ gr is finished , it is running &amp; kt@@ ops ; next , if the field activation input is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the system area of the control bar when reading , it disappears again as soon as the reading is completed .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , cancel , stop and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the map orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab General and tick the voice output there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . then check the text that is to be read and select Text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML , pre @-@ tension@@ ing lines and other invisible stamps are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the enhanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read text displayed . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then select the text that is to be read and select Text in the main menu . then the speech output should begin .
this also works if &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system that noti@@ fies you about events that you have set up . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up that you are notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can read the I@@ RC news text .
supports ein &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as this can be accepted in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is edited before it is sent to speech @-@ dispat@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation to replace incorrect spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the display of screen readers is the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and continues these orders . when the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the output of the warning .
news is the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that reads messages . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about this .
the rest are simple text orders . every order you get from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen readers . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such pre @-@ reads , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen readers . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
character Chain Re@@ plac@@ ements replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is delivered with pre @-@ defined string inser@@ ting filters that allow the replacement of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included for the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in S@@ Sm@@ l .
with speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice on the speakers , for example , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged at the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning , or a warning message is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts , it is processed by all the activated filters that have been set up on the page below . the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters equipped . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the below installation di@@ alogs are displayed below .
for the creation of string translation filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the related replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily ; it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ bet . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copies .
the character encoding filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filters apply if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing the words , the character encoding filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ator characters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ forming &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
specify the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PA@@ TH , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
you can send text to a particular speaker , which is set up on the card card , or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is passed to the filter , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker characteristics that the program gives the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is selected and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card card . you can over@@ ride the chosen speaker with the speaker selection filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . if installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &gt; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text comp@@ lies with the filter conditions presented above , the speaker will be selected to match the requested requirements . click on the button on the right to display the speaker selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filters if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the speech output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the speech output API of &amp; k@@ de ; for the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is , see the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , enter
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . first run kt@@ ops in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone for S@@ able to work at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice for reading websites . make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish fade . what can I do about it ?
make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , you may be able to fix them by using a character substitute filter . see .

the speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the accompanying documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can upload the package to kt@@ ts@@ d . you can also find the source code from the kt@@ ts@@ d folder . you can also find the source code from the ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out @-@ of @-@ date . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer at the supported languages . check also the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information , which are not contained in this manual .
speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to extend your speech to another syn@@ thesizer , contact the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for support of S@@ Sm@@ l and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile , compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts , translate from the source code archive , or downloaded the currently created tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts , first check whether speech dispens@@ ers work properly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . you can use the script @-@ script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do this .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of speech @-@ dispat@@ cher ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the set @-@ up of speech @-@ dispat@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into single sentences . the user can leave sentences or paragra@@ phs , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in .
if you click Add Spe@@ aker on Add , and with it to insert a speaker into the list or click Edit , the card reader device will be displayed . as an example , the set @-@ up of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting is done automatically . in general , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these sliding controls allow you to adjust the volume , speaking velocity and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and display this gray , the voice selected by you does not allow these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click on Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed by kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr at the start of the calendar . otherwise , after the start only the symbol kt@@ mas@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t work yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the job , the number of sentences and the currently processed sentence .
with the buttons in this row , you can move forward or backward in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also .
only text orders are listed and managed here . screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ats ; see here .
select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has become &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or trac@@ ts ; cannot load the required libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equ@@ als about half and 200@@ x@@ . % about double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program so@@ x needs to be installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; Desktop .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in case of doubt , choose Standard .
on this card you can set up special actions whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders :
the display of screen readers is the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . once the screen reader is read , the orders received will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that messages messages . if you are looking to read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file will always play when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card only apply to normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the expenses of Screen readers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; keep K@@ not@@ fy messages pre @-@ read , start t@@ t@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the notification card noti@@ fications appear .
check this check box to switch off &amp; check ; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts should do ; if an event occurs , you have the following choices :
if you have selected a custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter the characteristics of the speaker you want here . default select the speaker that is displayed in the list on the list of speakers as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels of events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . you can set the noti@@ fications to be read as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the store button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( S@@ Sm@@ l ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unci@@ ation of abbrevi@@ ations . S@@ Sm@@ l is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ops ; S@@ Sm@@ l only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of S@@ Sm@@ l .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , S@@ Sm@@ l text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ level detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single sentences . thus , you can start or skip orders sooner or later , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional level detection filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ level recognition filter is automatically set up as a default . you can modify its settings or add further set @-@ level detection filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to get to know the selection of speakers is to try out . switch off the selection of speakers and enter text to read . switch off the speech selection , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you must have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then hold or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ level recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be turned off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set @-@ level recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for phrases and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator ( dec@@ im@@ al@@ code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text prior to filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , al@@ erts , messages or the output of screen recor@@ ders .
if you have removed from see the normal set @-@ level detection filter , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can over@@ write the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ aker Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab on the card selection menu . the card card is displayed when you click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apply &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
use of the most appropriate speaker , which has all the characteristics of an appointed speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; t@@ kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Method &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select here the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
mark this check box if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a primary feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the Spe@@ aker range , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the Def@@ ault or@@ ator and then use Spe@@ akers , which is closest to the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input is 0 ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr r@@ ushes immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get back@@ tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is an un@@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , it is possible to install a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . when I receive a text order , freezing &amp; kt@@ ts ; ein . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is a problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , preventing the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . see the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) website at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org for potential solutions .
I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show that voice .
add the new voice to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ ve / Vo@@ ices . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL , where you have found the voice to the developers .
in order for this to work , the program so@@ x needs to be installed and can be discover@@ able via the PA@@ TH environment variable . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the card card for speaker devices . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speaking velocity are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; reads . ( this is because the HTML is turned into S@@ Sm@@ l . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; by &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ S@@ Sm@@ l forming filter , and set up the speaking velocity .
I do not manage to read web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival spokes@@ man , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l @-@ file will reject the GEN@@ DER tags . the same is true for the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate drawing replacement filter and now I can move in &amp; kt@@ ops ; no more rules set forward or backward . on the tab orders it is displayed , the order consists only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clam@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not be filtered out . instead , use a filter for set @-@ limit recognition instead .
al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by logging in &amp; kt@@ ts before using G@@ Stre@@ amer ; ( HTTP : / / stre@@ amer .@@ fre@@ ed@@ king@@ top@@ .org )
if your system counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; in addition , if you stop a text order and start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ de will not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speaking speed but is otherwise not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar packaged archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) . the configure parameter for switching the setting displays the configure parameter that causes the passing of the output .
as default , in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example :
on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources .
CD k@@ de@@ posit@@ echo kt@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd @-@ ts@@ d make su make install
before using &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your speech syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions you have with the syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is revealed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported . in many voices , you can adjust volume , speaking velocity and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you must install at least one language . help is provided in the instructions provided with the festival . if you would like to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the r@@ ussi@@ an voices , you must enter MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone for the voices . select a ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .

if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete language dispens@@ ing system . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ ph@@ one@@ files . you need additional software to create this phone . festival generates this by &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be produced from German texts di@@ phone . for more information , see .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the Festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices will not be installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; Fol@@ der files will not be installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , but in the Fol@@ der Festival / lib / . instructions can be found under
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA . required is either Festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package you have downloaded .

Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener language syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither pitch , volume nor speaking speed can be adjusted .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops ; any speech syn@@ thesizer , which can be controlled on the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the speech output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the administration of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf is designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; for the user to create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version :
the network settings module is loaded when the option Network Set@@ ting in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this system tries to detect the platform used on the system automatically .
if the platform cannot be detected , the selection of hands is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited to distribution and release . by checking the non @-@ re @-@ question the setting can be set up permanently . next start of the network settings , this selection will be pres@@ et automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , click the button system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the full functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three hor@@ semen :
the network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed from the network interfaces :
the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button ... to set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click on the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with more options .
the automatic mode sel@@ ects TCP / IP settings from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings for the system are executed at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the selection manual can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the server , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or turned off as needed . switch on a switched off network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or turned off as needed . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ...
determines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical link to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host has ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will solve this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
entries can be added , removed or altered . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting a entry or gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons down or down in the priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on the Add ... from the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Calcul@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button . it will display the Edit dialog .
the list of name @-@ known hosts describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list named Nam@@ ely contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit . edit the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Modi@@ fied Calcul@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to enable the changes , the following command must be set in an &amp; Con@@ sole ; the following command is set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphic interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given , in the second , all of the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , configuration files are discussed .
this section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found major dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact person who has a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , eg . .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP transmission .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this section you will find the configuration files affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content found there in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is dropped by the scrip@@ ting in Su@@ SE . another version than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first consisted of creating a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing .
before a tape can be used , it must be from &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; pul@@ ls back the tape and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ credits on the tape do not , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
if you can &apos;t find it , you will be asked if the band@@ index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was included . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by out@@ wards of the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ection of the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without risk .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before being used , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted before using &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy tape drives do not require format@@ ting the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the belt name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat moves with the format@@ ting of the tape . all the data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you initiate the backup process , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Safe ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog for backup will open . in this dialog , you can check the selected files once again and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the item entry ...
once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog box appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for review .
if you have confirmed the review settings , the dialog appears to review . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before re@@ producing the restore , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu .
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog for recovery appears . in this dialog , you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will be restored . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the newly elected folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independently of the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding option of the tape device .
this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat , before the tape is incorporated into the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , &amp; k@@ dat tries to lock the ej@@ ector at the tape drive . possibly this setting doesn &apos;t work on all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when resol@@ ving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat , the band will automatically disc@@ ard the tape . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy sc@@ Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat tries to change the hardware @-@ based block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are compiled as follows :
( n Byte ) The volume of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .

&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , information on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system places the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , tries to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and analyze protocol files of certain programs .
in current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the sy@@ slo@@ g server format and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log functions , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , it tries to open the system log ; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not appear , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for which ordinary users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or string . the list of the log rows will now automatically be displayed , so that only log rows that match the selected filter will be displayed . in the default setting , a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can , of course , select another entry in this place . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the protocol file system protocol , then show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent and / or generated by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as protocol lines of level indication .
if you only want to display certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron Protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . this may , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you can use filter bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can activate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To new lines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option in the main window context menu to display all new additions to the new lines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org . you can find more up @-@ to @-@ date information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion Archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly develops to the standard for program start @-@ up when the system is elevated to &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
here I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and new format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux kernel first looks under / etc following an In@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a / etc directory instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service that you want to start at boot up or change to another run@@ level . system services don &apos;t include such things like set@@ serial , which will only be started once . such calls include r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if you don &apos;t have much use . you can also set a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot .
the kernel is searching in@@ it at different places and starts the first one he finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning section :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you come to repair it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how do you start all the correct scripts now ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stop in@@ it system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if one contains a K , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that can only run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; sen@@ d@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user running level , that &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level ( resp@@ . stop ) .
you can also move scripts between run@@ levels or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry will be removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry already existed previously in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ter numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to add the system service again .
note : at present there is no way to restore items that have been thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired running level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with standard Run@@ ning levels , and now the machine is constantly re@@ eling . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but is unfortunately not standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply exit without a message if their configuration files are not present or incor@@ rectly set up .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . this program allows you to manage users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made any changes you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or save the entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry .
some card cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can set individual settings . other flash@@ cards will appear if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Unix .
the password management card appears if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Unix .
this card only appears if at least one fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the limitations on the space available in KB :
these parameters can be individually adjusted for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field file system with limited space limitation .
the tab groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , which belongs to the user , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the Group dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group , or click the appropriate add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
