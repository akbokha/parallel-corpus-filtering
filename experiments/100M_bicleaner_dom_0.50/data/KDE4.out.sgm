<seg id="1">Translate the module website in & konqueror; translate the menu under Extras website. select the output and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the entire & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not make important decisions without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only Web pages can be translated. other texts should be translated by the Babelfish page, where you can insert texts to be translated directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; to load, select Settings... Open the Toolbar tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the box kde; addons. please note that you may need more modules on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page that has crashed & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module view filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras' View Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, example: documentElement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view of objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The specificity of & FSView; consists of representing nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">In & FSView, the size of a file or folder reflects the size of a file or folder. thus, large files, even then easily detected, can easily be detected if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView may be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles possess meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle turned over view color mode can be either depth for the easy recognition of the nesting depth or the representation of another file attribute, such as the name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (and therefore you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle).</seg>
<seg id="19">In the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always complied with. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and this frame will need space, which is no longer available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How partitioning the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this context, it is advisable for the caption and avoidance of space losses through frames to create rectangular rectangles that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view in the area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally it was & FSView; conceived as a small test application and introduction into the use of the TreeMap Widget, which was developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Photo Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the gallery, a dialog opens, allowing you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Title of the page allows you to edit the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line option has a sliders and a rotation field to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">Display the file name of the picture with the check box to see if the file names are shown in the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">Show the box file size of the image to see if the file size is shown in the images in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="33">Copy original pictures with the check box to see if the original pictures should be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">To use the comment file check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box you can specify a different color depth for the thumbnail images than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation area can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Windows Navigation Pane or with the key shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror navigation pane; and drag the music files you want to listen to in media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser identifiers and add a menu entry to & konqueror; in addition, with which you can change browser and operating system recognition for single domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser identifier of & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you are coming to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser identifier into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the password in MSIE for pages that reject the access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser identifier to call up with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Use elements and attributes, are properly displayed with the identification of this outdated browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported via the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use these to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing skills can be easily extended with KDE Image plugins interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as & eg; over the camera or lens to be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & quot; programs is also & digikam; an open source project. that means it is dependent on supporting the end users. therefore, they should report problems and possibilities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; tries to make reporting problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. if you are a regular user of & digikam; are, then we encourage you to encourage the user mailing list of & digikam; in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digikam; homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to take part in & digikam; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you plan & edit; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data collection is stored. this path stays the same for all picture folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek. settings digikam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folders. & digikam; look at each subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; durably recursively calls the library path in its entire depth. you cannot exclude any subfolders unless it is iste in hidden folder. you can do this by inserting a point in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as base folders, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digikam your digital camera. after that you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it is possible to work with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to setup this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Roh Decoderation and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to help you connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported via the gphoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">Digital cameras, which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras, also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a popular protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions across the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gphot2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">The Exif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the thumbnails. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, thumbnails may not be standing or generating could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digikam; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIP I modules: the KDE Image plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam; to provide KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for KIP I modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digikam; by writing a small module to complement a function when the changes to & digikam; to perform itself.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can store an image in another part of the tree, above the horizontal partition line or in another application window. the only limitation is that the image cannot be stored in keywords, data lists or searches.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to remove the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus filtering on the file name only works if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can you configure in the Albensettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlisteeper; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were created on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the album's properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly in an album. select album Importieren images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select album Imports screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu, you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select the album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you have placed will be used to sort your photos, if you want to add or delete a collection from the toolbar. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums After Date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The elders, average, New testers: these set the date on the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of last change of each file will be used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first opened an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlisteeper. this is meant to help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another picture as an album icon, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; Select as album preview list; in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left side of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will show you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be displayed in this album in the image window. each picture is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you have to wait briefly while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recreate all thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the corresponding preview. what information is this can be edited by editing; set up the albums page and adjust the thumbnail area to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse-pointer a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important properties including all the tags of a photo. the screen shot at the top of the section Introduction to the main window shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about & digikam; go. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image processing displays your photos and allows you to reach a number of improvements to them. you can select all the functions with & digikam; you can choose between viewing images, slide show or editing images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by editing either F4 Image editing... or selecting the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and editing.... in the editing section, you can see how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by right-clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the opening menu. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing with other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data with you when you save the changed image. this way, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to right-click on the preview and select Rotate. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & digikam; delete, it will be moved to the garbage bin of & kde; move. F8 Image Delete or Del if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumslisteeper; organizes your photos based on data. & digikam; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the datasheet at the bottom of the data view so that you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or searching.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your words logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My stitched list; fold so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for fast access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. furthermore, the keywords are re-imported when & digikam; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keywords, or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword using the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by drawing it to the desired position in the tree and placing it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword to move. a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">"" "you can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and selecting the keyword" "" "Edit" "" "in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keywords." ""</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another picture as an album icon, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select As the album preview in the context menu. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to provide with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My stitching info; alternatively, you can also right-click on the preview of the pictures and select keyword submenu from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can give a keyword to each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keyword, it will be shown below the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can right-click the right mouse button of the photo and select from the menu-menu Remove. the menu will show you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent adjusting histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame, just click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit. this displays all associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps, and even more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">The search box is a small lamp that is green when the search hits. if you click here the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if the search did not find anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as search criteria. after you have been saved, it filters in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your choice, press the head OK and search is done. the results will be used in the View My Search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection once again, you only have to select the corresponding entry from the View My Search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the form will appear again with the search information you have entered. if you choose to edit as advanced search, the dialog for the extended search will appear. here you can find more rules for the search. for more information, see the Advanced Search Tool.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules will be added to the search group / search group added or deleted from it. any option can be associated with others using the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... you can create search of type & quot; AND NETquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar. using a swellert, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you push a picture from anywhere via the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand-paint sketch: draw a quick sketch and work and find the matching pictures. here too, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map finder based on the Marble mini program. you can press in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move. move it while you click the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a lighting table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add the luminous table from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminous table and its window open. if you are back in & digicame; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is visible. if you select preview from the toolbar and perform a zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, you can also compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures. if you use pair-wise navigate from the toolbar, then the two first images will be automatically loaded into the areas to the same. the picture to the right is displayed in the right-hand corner. this simplifies it through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal delete actions work directly out of the lighting table like F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnail frames. this makes it easy to associate visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section you will find a built-in swivel function, which you can see at the crossed arrows. to wave the visible area of the picture, you must click them and hold the & LMB; hold down in the preview and then both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works as well as in other views. just use the zoom controller under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - aside from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process following after the image has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and use your pictures. here, we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that & digikam; use. we view the download, rename, remove, convert, group, backup, backup, duplicate, archive, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital Stock Management absorbs, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confectures and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. in accordance with your definition, metadata is data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you don't even need to find a specific photo without inventory management. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly don't use & digikam; the approach can store metadata both in a database and in the image files, and secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; make sure you have to switch to a bigger drive sometime.</seg>
<seg id="151">You might be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will publish subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements, such as versioning photos, archiving, workflow, constant feed of images on different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend saving the metadata in & digikam the metadata stored in the editing page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do this, edit and edit a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now assign keywords, labels and a rating to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos during the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's continue with keywords, keywords, as you frequently name in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import cataloged images from another source with embedded keyword, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or add the images to the right place. selecting the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by pulling a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam; updated as it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The diagram shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very crude representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beachpanorama. if you look closer, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I'll tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the french Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! one starts to dream, to have associations, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the subject you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text as lettering in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8). you can even export it for a selection of images. KDE even provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? wasn't it a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now at a speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that someday, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using images with geographical data. & digikam; can also export cml files you can open with GoogleEarth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wording with copyright and designates the practice to use the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the direction page of & digikam which should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desirable to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization may not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author's title (synonym for author's line): links with the author. examples of this can be titles like: employed photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright paragraphs although they do not provide protection against abuse. each of which has a little more than basic knowledge in work with calculator, this can only be of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, disseminated superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper pictures or negatives. in this section, we are dealing with problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these cautious ones have to be treated and you can't wait longer than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can become unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording equipment and store them in the correct way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is an inexpensive program called IsoBuster which apparently works wonders for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read out the damaged data from damaged disk, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a dual player Blu-ray Disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high-quality media in a non-proprietary format. then read out the media with a description, date & author and then store them on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides on this subject a large field study about the fault mechanisms of hard drives: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART can't detect this error. some of SMART identified errors announce the immediate failure. these are especially read errors and displacement counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't make a lot of electric shocks, it looks different with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause scratched keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in strip. however, remember that not every plug-in strip also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that all peripherals connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide voltage shocks which also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. this gives you the ability to store your data and keep the system down. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they comply with the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety when it comes to electricity disruptions with the cost to avoid this. a high quality overvoltage protection can be reached by up to €40. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can include it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offering to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are compared to the hard drives home though very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data over the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo Community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are directed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very secure. thanks to the TCP protocol, transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transfer chain on the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the filesystem ZFS and btrfs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred to you, not when this happened in your hardware. all these interruptions remain undiscovered until you open a photo one day and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer route than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at the moment, you should look into the future. in 2010, you will see thousands of mistakes a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard compatible with GPL. we can only hope that it will soon also be available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrf file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used by ZFS and is also available for & Linux; it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss on notebook and 46% on workstations. when notebooks, the share of thefts is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lesser damage, e.g. theft or re-installation. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no one has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most popular file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that as the technology develops further there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. a sensor size of 6 megapixels and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't worry anyone else for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss every year. therefore, backup your data in a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous, like reinstalling your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make every day your backup on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash gets you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, a frequent reason for data loss despite fuse is panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. this creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential protection.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmissions, rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure gives you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata that stored IPTC data stored in the image file, retain associate XMP files, retain original, memory, scalability, media, restore images and metadata, copy images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures survive the next 40 years, that is about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to nature, you need to look at everything that is said today with caution and reassess as time goes by. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, your storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional expression for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. at * nix systems such as & Linux, you can copy this area and shift it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new disk was detected by the system but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& nbsp; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; Parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is available that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been designed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. PNG can recommend Gamma- and Chromaticity data for improved color assignment at heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (delate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras, you can store your images in this format.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG's digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Educational resource block; XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata platformTags, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive your recording, most of them in the raw format, because it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI communities and DCMI groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and clarifying efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images on the camera edium are, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for fine-layered editing. if you edit the images again with & edited, then you should add metadata again. these were cut off by the other programs under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them in web galleries, code in mpeg, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in the section adding a photo to an album you can add a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use it, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is established, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the file association, photos, movies, music etc. will be displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. this information is the same as for the metadata page bar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all. this downloads all photos from your camera to a single album in & digikam;. downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend to check if the pictures are safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired one with the standard selection methods. once you have selected the photos, use the button Download and then download select. the selected button is downloaded until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these images have not been edited by & digikam; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the buttons all download or download selected albums, a dialog allows you to select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is displayed in the My Albums section. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digikam; downloads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at a time by deleting the Delete All. if you only want to delete some, then you have to select them first and then delete the selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera; the photos will not be copied to the sleeves; they should be carefully checked before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera hook completely, you should do so via the camera command, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are normally re-used after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you load photos from different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the commit opens three more options that are performed before the photos are saved on the disk. the first two affect the data about the author in the Standard Autoridentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another date format than the standard format, for example, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S in the edit field.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase letters. or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digikam, is used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are stored and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic rotation during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera does not provide this information, it can be edited and digitised; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to switch off the automatic turn, use the Extended button and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digikam; this can be used to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same album. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case it saves & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to switch this option. use the Extended button and select the Date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select uploading. the file selection dialog box & kde; appears in which you can select the files that are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digikam; you where the pictures should be uploaded. a folder selector dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. data analysis can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken you can open a browser showing the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digikam, users who want to locate the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save this data in gpx format since this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate data from images and GPS. on the following page you can use the same under & Linux; make gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script working with the Exiftool of Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hairy coordinates, such as maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; tries to give you so much control over his work procedures as possible. there are many settings that modify the behaviour of & digikam; change. to access these settings, you need to edit in the Settings menu; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set on embedded preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; fix when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the identity and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option has been selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for the author's line: this field should contain the professional title of the photographer. these can be names like e.g. hired photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a further description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for provider: use this field to specify which the photo offers. this must not be the author, if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of other & quot; anbietenquot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group resp. agency that provides the image should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this means that metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited and edited without lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded scriptions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. note: in pictures that already contain captions, they are overwritten by the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests over a file in the main window. depending on the option selected, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digikam; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The brightness of & digikam; can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the LED these settings will not be available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression option you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce picture quality, because PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">Compress the TIFF-files option to switch the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality, because the delate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the loss-prone setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning process.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was just a picture viewer for photos. currently it evolves very quickly to a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if you are more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels in odd lines, this difference creates a lattice pattern in output. if you use this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option characterizes the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. default is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default it is the pointed-lights, so the parts of your images that are burned, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed-lights, as a continuous white. the setting colors release creates some unusual results as they display the pointed lights in various rose tones.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general don't saturate as quickly as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the Recreconstruct option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the editing pane; to keep the time for the demo icing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or FarbreDesign.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenos-Directed) created the quality for me and the paper used by me.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the rot- and blue-correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color gradient correction as you are carried out during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to get it back. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information like the color information can be translated from a color space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folders Set the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you store all your profiles. & digikam; check this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the option & quot; default source; to postpone for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like Canon, which do not contain any color-tonal mapping or gamma correction.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be given back from one device. this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated. this could be corrected manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which colour profile is provided for. unfortunately, not for Canon models. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course, this answer is inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface can & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use, and these will then be edited by & digikam; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of slide show should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left side a list of all supported cameras. on the right side there is a button Automatische Recognition that tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is connected properly, switched on and in picture display mode. currently, here are serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera box.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digikam; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the Mülleimer, you can set the conversation between & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album, you can find more details when deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">Editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly controlled by & digikam; apply if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without any queries. otherwise, you need to store the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the welcome screen by & digikam; when starting, this speeds up & digikam the start-up process.</seg>
<seg id="334">The Start Start after new photos forces & digikam; search the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digikam; if something is deleted from the base folder, asks & digikam; you know if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & digikam; to adjust the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar under Settings Design. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement. the image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the ad / editing entry.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you can find in the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, zoom factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top of the screen, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using Save or Save the button Save from the tool bar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by reproducing or using the button The button Restore the image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done in the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of the image processing can be undone or restored. you can undo the last action by modifying undo or restore by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make use of the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB, press the reverse or restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in-between will also be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword, using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made any changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: choose the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc button. normally, the tool bar is displayed. if you do not want this, you can call it in the editing dialog of & digikam; you can see this section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select print in the File menu and get the default & kde; Print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences. whole picture templates can be printed from your selection. you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export Printer Assistant. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digikam; main window has a sidebar at the right edge providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation file, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the user button, there is a button. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcode Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field of Regency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree, and a selection box with previously mentioned keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can easily limit the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is particularly useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further simplification in entering keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all words of an image are stored in the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only apply to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please refer to the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">If the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and place it on the selection. then, a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a catchword from the right keyword tree was drawn to the selection and dropped there. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be turned off in settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it needs to be one or its, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry to search in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an extended search through all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly worked on & digikam; s specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner come from a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that are the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the subject comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should allow you to make your own informed decisions in order to get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">They work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image output is via email or web, where sRGB is the de-facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB really works and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and thus have to worry about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limitation to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindblooms's excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to crush my monitor if I chose to work in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you have to configure your monitor because sRGB states that your monitor is sticking to sRGB. if you are working as in the color space of sRGB then you must either use your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, balance, automatic matching and contrast expand from the menu Correcting Automatic correcting attempt automatically from your colors to make the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaling the LeustStrength above the whole picture, so that the darkest point black and the brightest spot will change as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Matching: this method adjusts the luminosity factor of the selected image, making the histogram of the intensity channel as flat as possible. sometimes the same amount of pixels is achieved by improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balancing: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it identifies the dark and bright boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enlarge contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a re-jib of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly restricted as there is a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright of Pawel T. Jochnym. you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be customized in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the tool's settings. if you want to see the original white balance then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The target photos can be previewed with a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram is shown to change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit pictures, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your results depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also dim down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the chosen color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Save the buttons as and load exactly this. every setting of the white balance you have set you can store it in a text file and load it back later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button reverts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another photo than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of shell images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles lets you consult the color management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust several colour channels at the same time and allows you to store your settings so that you can always make use of them for more photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner is always making the same mistake and you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors Gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digikam; tool colour effects provide four colour effects, a solar effect effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that emerged when a partly developed pressure applied a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colours were inverted by the second lighting. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to fine tune this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and it processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and hot. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a reverse colour film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos. you can also experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. even in this case, the brightness / saturation tool is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple contrast / contrast / gamma, the tool clay correction is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialog has a very complicated effect on this tool, you only need the area of the slider for the application described here.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three slider will be clicked into and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the controller to see how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. previewing will be dynamically updated based on the image's settings. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be adjusted whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinboards can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values as interactively as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the values set in the file system can be saved and loaded later. the Gimp level format is used to do so.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipette, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, resources and saturation tones. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below, you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a picture. intensity and Alpha Channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two icons to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera mostly the linear mode is the most useful. in this case, the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a short arrow to the right, e.g. the bright notes, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a matching line will be shown on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. enable the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curves.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if you find overexposed pixels in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the Luminance channel. shades of shade and sunshine were set using the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digikam channel mixer; image processing is a tool to improve colour channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with your own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line will appear in the histogram to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to keep luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer is then THE tool for generating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space. color-brewing consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern in each channel is different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color-brewing first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can save you for later and then load it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re-adjusted. the luminance option is enabled. the original image can be seen in (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of its abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can easily be converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and simulates lunar scenes at daytime. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural colour tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Epithaton: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the redevelopment in a squamatoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With & digikam; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the altered under (2). the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With & digikam; tool frame add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to retain his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame add the module from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your image. throughout, the image rotates with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), cooled it with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adding a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be greater than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any location. this also works in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply insert the text and place it with the mouse. you will need to adjust the font size of the image size. the bigger the picture, the bigger the character set must be. at the end, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Every setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button 'OK'. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & digikam; tool template apply you can lay a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu apply in image editing can be used to create templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the default folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder is set for the templates a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the template's thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrinks: this button reduces the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces grainy images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing may be the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">The same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequent sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera is often used for internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners alter a sharpness filter while reading the image. if you deactivate it, you will get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening sharpen. you can call this using the menu entry Correcting sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">The sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also strengthens the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image refocus the tool. in general, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image slightly softly is much easier than sharpening. use the tool for soft marking with the menu entry Correcting plasticizers and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter using the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of the radius or the amount increases the effect. if you make the blur mask strong, noise and the impression of grates are generated near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images permit larger radii. therefore, you should sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The sum represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image, which is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference-amount used. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between tones are excluded and therefore beauty defects in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the fuzzy masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred masking has been applied with Radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted filtering algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filters. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is using a blur mask. refocusing often reaches better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular holding works much better than the Gauss's Failure. the Gauss's Failure has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixies, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's Fitting is even heavily influenced by the remote pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folds. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artifacts. the correlation may be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high correlation is reduced to the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are very rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value will further vanish the picture.</seg>
<seg id="502">This is most commonly caused by a previously executed blur filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 in order to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transition matrices. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. however, note that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform any cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but leave unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally Unsharp Masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood used than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, invisible masks always have to produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never eliminate the effect of the sharpness. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. practically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothened controller sets the blurring of the area that has been darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink duct allows a modified colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools for removing unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool includes several default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the image. a value of 0.9 should provide details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. please note that the detail conservation should always be subordinate to directional dependence.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 only smoothes in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD noise will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG efacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to match the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: indicates how often the algorithm will go through. normally, here is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step distance [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, it should also be small. be sure that small angles will generate a long term. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more the quality you receive by choosing this option is only minor, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make this happen. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting picture errors is relatively fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shutdown.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad movie shift during the journey. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to lessen image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, for example from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a coarse hiss that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings subwindow can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time required by the filter per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch in front of the filter to determine light seal changes. if it is increased, roughness changes will be reset. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or blacksling occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value enhances the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or roughness peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance depth tolerance of the image. we recommend modifying either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend modifying either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas which are typically more harsh. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the alignment of the adaptive filter radius. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius responds to variations in the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all the noise reduction parameters you set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpen a picture. use tool for soft sign with the menu entry Correcting plasticizers and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">These filters for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss' rushing, film gradations, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG image artifacts: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even far from it. as a loss-prone compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; artifacts & quot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The save as and load buttons make this happen. every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and then reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a very long time and load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction.. The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see a further example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were applied to an old color photo that was read with a scanner. you can see the scanning artefacts created by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digikam; tool Hotpixel makes it possible to remove Hotpixel pictures with a CCD camera gem, eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw-mode photos since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel-quot; and 'quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image extraction method. currently there is no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD failures.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the right dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will remember the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter using the current settings. poor pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then, select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a one-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposures. the original image has been increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can not even illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead, quot; vignettierenquot; (shady) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by reducing the light that the sensor arrives there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 for aperture filters, which may cause the necessary closing time in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since there are otherwise blur effects caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the wide range of exposure areas of today's film and the grayscale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image that has been made without this filter. the tool vignetting correction applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the Vignetting Correction Filter and with three more exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of intensity damping at the point of greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with a aperture setting of 1, or accidentally a luminous intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Contrast and Gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction decreases the brightness of pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, as you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of exposure of the target image, leave the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the insertion correction to a picture. the original picture (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treated the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third gradient has a similar round effect, but flatters at edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth grade corrects the distant corners to the second graph. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be eliminated almost.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of the distortion second degree. with negative values, tone-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the reverse side of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and results in a correction first degree. negative values increase while positive image size decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values improve them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The pitch or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before any change or size changes. best perform this correction as first. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a barrel-like correction the effect would appear obvious to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal support line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to fix the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the seashore or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the sound / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu Transforming Cutting from image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects such as pictures from the front, frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the image have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture can be seen in (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web page accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can adjust two parameters of film graining and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the Füge Film Acquisition option if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared films, especially the green channel makes no sense to use the effect on black / white photos since the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; filter film grain is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver particles of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grains effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, streetphotographic, grainy spectacle specifically in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digikam; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance as an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The top selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better for large images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the machined is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide picture is 1 and smooth17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. the lines that define the outlines in drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 in order to control this effect. the upper control selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the altered image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digikam; filter Gravure shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digikam; filter Gravure is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works especially well in images with a simple structure in which color is not the most important thing. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraver filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look like it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave-blocks 1, the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharfe: blurs the image along the star-shaped lines that focus on one focus. this simulates the sharpness of a zooming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial sharpness: blurs the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the sharpness of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance sharpness: blurs the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to come back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion picture: blurs the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: taken from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Sharpness: blurs the image softly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and glossy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurs the image by shifting the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the basins in the picture and blurs them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then rebuilds it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects take long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digikam; image processing can hold a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter regentropfen, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original picture (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed picture (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can move it through mirroring or turning into the right orientation. the tools for this can be found in the Transforming Rotate or Transforming Screaming.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you re-invent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size change. select Change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Upload buttons are used in the same way. each insertion for photo magnification can be saved as a text file and then reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating a photo is very fast at what it does, but it can still take a long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">The original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear default enlargement to comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The trimming of a photo is not only a frequently performed operation but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. in order to cut a photo you just have to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be scanned out. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look like after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The Ctrl button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog is retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait, the larger value of the height and the width of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool after aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool Following the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). when you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the combination help make it possible to hide aids so that you can put together your images better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-leg rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonic triangles on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division which is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it dives in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational figure of 1,618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is equal to 1: 1.618 the gold middle. a composition which follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle will provide more fluid aid lines when composing a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">Compared to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition results in the view of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. there should be something that directs the eye to the centre of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the gold spiral discussed above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that unlike harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not a triangular triangles. diagonal to place on these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal and Vertical View options can be used to mirror the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not keep the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can repair this with the & digikam; image processing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot an image you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function Transforming Cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is to automatically cut the function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the turn. please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recalculated. on the right of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left upper: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left bottom: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image will be spared a little. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double the effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasurable triangular holes at the corners. one way to bersome it is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">A horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be shown on the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and horizontal line is displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the scaling tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is blurred a bit. for a single shot this effect is usually negligible, but two shavings generate twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the painting, the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible at this point to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF under it.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that are familiar with. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, it is displayed & digikam; the file in the image editing pane. you can change this list of file extensions. see section Configuration for more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression procedures on digital images. redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG for the same compression ratio. the 2000s version can also save loss-free if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, please read Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful tutorials in English. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digikam; supports loading of raw images only with the program dcraw, which is contained in & digikam. this supports more than 200 raw file formats. all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the website of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by & digikam;</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need the photo editing are included in & digikam; their description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpening, softmarks, noise reduction, refocusing, unsharp mask, & etc;. use a consistent dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture applied; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. on the left of it, five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Divide vertically without duplicating. the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal parts without duplicates. the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected area.</seg>
<seg id="705">Divide vertically. the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and discard it on the part of the image you want to preview. preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the ability to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings of the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The sidebar properties display the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>

<seg id="725">& graphic viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -dot; graphics; graphics are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs; programs that include & graphviz; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphic viewer; -Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphical viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -dot; graphics; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphical viewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & quot; & quot; & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; the graph recounts and is in & kgraphviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & cate; to open or to open the graph in & graphics viewer; in an & cate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Load large graphs (currently there are problems starting at around 1000 knot and a hack to present more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kgraphviewer; is an & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own sub-window. initially, if you start & kgraphviewer; without an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only open the icon file and open the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special buttons, left and right by pressing & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by the factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been changed from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; can also memorize your decision, so that later it will be used. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up the menu item Settings... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graphite file outside of a running & kscreen viewer; eg; in the file browser or at the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new and graphic viewer; or want to display the loaded graph in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When starting the program, you can let all graphs of your last session open again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph, which come to a page, should be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graphene distributed across multiple pages without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">Page Restore Store gives you the ability to specify behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive, eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or request the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">Opening the page opens the possibility to specify the behaviour of & kimaviewer; specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives you the ability to set the start behaviour of & kgraphviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be prompted at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears at a click on the main window with the & RMBn; opens further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz; -layout algorithms. the entries, as they are described on the & graphviz web page, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directed graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directional graphs. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato algorithm is the default for non-generated graphene. it produces representations according to the springboard model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a bounce-spring model for undated graphs. it uses the Fruitman-Reingold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm directs the node circular to according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">The command should accept the graphite file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in the xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms provide special options, or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graphene (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directed, & neato; for rendered graphs).</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module loading images provides tools to read new images and save them.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan pictures: use the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the Sane project or any other source such as Video streams. to make this work you must have installed Kooka and Sane.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item pictures, a dialog appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. here, select the source from which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears to replace the default ducrhe's own to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the Scannen button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, bottom corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is displayed completely, as some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the scan button, you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window for setting the image file options appears. please remember that type BMP is not compressed and therefore very large files. you also need to select or create the folder & # 160; you will need to save or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected the Imports &gt; screen shot menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screenshots:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read in to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If All your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will be able to read the currently visible workspace.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you have to switch to other working surfaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management online. Flickr makes it possible to send photos to people who are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world, make photos of your camera phone online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module exporting to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be led through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication, so it is virtually your ID to Flickr. a browser will be started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful login, the module can send photos to the Flickr Website. you will be presented the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing 'Yes', you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module expires to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog indicating the current access permissions that the module displays. for upload, you need write permission. the module currently supports no other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Add Photo should be pressed once you have set all other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file chooser box. when you press the Ok button, upload the photos to Flickr Server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma-separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Optional, Friends and Famillie options, you can set the access permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as Privat.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose the Change option change the size of the photos before upload, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server.</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery exporting has no documentation at the moment. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the KIPI mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographical location allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographical data are stored in the EXIF keyword of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographical location module provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, latitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data, you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization correlations. this interface can bring together a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the dialog to see appears then. to perform a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one place for images, you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then click the correlated button to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a series of photos in the same place. since the dialog contains the coordinates of a call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. select the region in question and enlarge it. always check this again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a pile of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums to a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that should be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will be encoding UTF-8 to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab select allows you to select all albums that want to be exported to HTML. the tab selection allows you to select all albums to be exported to HTML. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the preview and the text displayed in the header of the HTML page will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Appearance tab defines the general look and layout for each page. the option For each image create a page creates a gallery where each image also gets its own page. if you click on a picture, a new page opens in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default viewer, eg; Kuickshow,</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab record defines the settings where and how to store the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIP IHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the messages to determine if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser is automatically started at the end to preview the gallery. press close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI viewer viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse clicks. it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below, without the usual losses of quality and metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size rises, because no compression of the color information takes place. this can also be found in the PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the KIPI mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor now has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata field, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work for all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual pictures you can add a basic image transition. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV to slide.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can use the K3b program to burn the medium.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diashau. afterwards, you can create the module via Extras mpeg Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are listed under picture files in the portfolio. there you can also change the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your schedule, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value generates very sudden, but a high, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the mpeg output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes, you can now start drinking a coffee with the button coding. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go quickly or quietly enjoy a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that codes or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages via the button settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print assistant allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing gimp. this is for example: useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIP I module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect from dcraw that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window appears in the mode for a single image. with the Preview Preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option will decide whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format, as it allows only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the EXif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion using the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to re-compress all images in an album. it uses the convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image. for this purpose four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): change of size in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepare the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIP I module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window with the images you have preselected will be displayed. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview of the right-hand side will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the list of images and drop them there to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures remove the selected pictures from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the pictures you can open the New message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are already attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not make sure to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format below menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted from lossless formats like TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG in image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, the original exposure data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is completed, the window will not automatically be closed so that you can view the status messages in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow a window appears asking questions about how to display your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant transitions using OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option will show that the file name of the images is displayed in the left lower corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">"" "the" "" "loop" "" "option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a loop loop. you can then cancel it manually with Esc." ""</seg>
<seg id="889">The option of choosing images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time interval between the images can be set between the images. 1500 milliseconds are 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should check this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly, every transition between the images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the KIPI mailing list at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your images and videos with annotations, you can browse through them, see the picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now in each group, i.e. in people, places and in group keyword records.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories for which you have entered information as you have given your images and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails. in the following, each one is described.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse over the entry, the browser view changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">When you select another person, only the images on which both persons are shown are displayed. by this selection method, you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person a thumbnail image, this is also true for places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture for this.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the name, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must select which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you will need to open the picture-view window (in more detail) and show in the context menu the entry Categories Editor. here you can customize the image for the respective person. in the view window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and choose which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you visit the Search entry in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog again on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the caption or description, the descriptions or descriptions of the images will be searched after this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can either be part of the total file, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all the images according to certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out similar features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog choose the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; demo. thereupon some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you date statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can change between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see part of a database by displaying the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (when you select a date, the first image will be displayed in the preview page) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate to preview.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a area of timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, only images of that time frame will appear in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your images. one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as a module (see). in the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create via the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each section is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the revision and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if you want to create a & kphotoalbum; export file that is to be seen on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML pages. this way you can avoid that information is displayed without a description. for example, that all images are displayed by a party. note that all images are exported at the moment. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can browse your images with a low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image bigger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if these are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created. the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. so that the import function, see, properly works, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that are just described have all three related to the base folder and / or URLs. in them, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the images. however, if you have spent a great deal of time recording the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kphotoalbum; this work will not be done again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored in the file itself or if only a link to images is stored in the file. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can have all the images together and share this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, Create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file looks for the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the file of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you have provided when creating the HTML files are searched. this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access through the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. there are three choices available:</seg>
<seg id="938">In the Manual located near the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically slide into the .kim file, copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth to compress the files. if you want to do this anyway, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the Import menu..., it will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders to import images to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you name the category individuals of the importing file (if you are a domain), while this category is in your database people. therefore, in the third dialog box you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and what categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and watch pictures: if you look at images, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at images of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will see the various steps from (1) laying the information about your images, via (2) viewing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the topmost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice, such as Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want to.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder in which your images are stored and automatically re-use it in future launches. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete member groups, i.e., all members of a group at one time in a group, instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; its module system communicates with other graphic applications, such as digikam and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules from multiple applications are shared among each other, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; this is why you should first test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures The & kphotoalbum; demo database can be accessed either via the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or through the menu Help.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications rearrange their pictures in albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates order for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">Simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply fits the current view, so all images that you see at the moment the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum has to be released; the modules also have a list of albums.</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be used in the category you specified in the settings dialog as category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category individuals, & kphotoalbum will do so, so if you had selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are not compatible with & kphotoalbum, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used from any other KDE application, see above a menu bar and toolbar. under the toolbar you can see the window to browse your image database. currently, it does not contain very much information as you do not yet have information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; it is possible to provide any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons depicted in the image where the image was taken, etc. you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. for example, on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures taken in Copenhagen were recorded.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images inside the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people are depicted, you can, by the fact that the names used are moved up, the persons can find and assign them faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting symbol by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and annotate these images with annotations. in this case, simply click the front and back buttons below the preview of the picture to the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, then it may be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the US. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture, you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a subgroup. to show you that it is a subgroup, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment Dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. additionally, you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to sort it into a sub-category of this entry. attention, this presupposes that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it out of the window pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options... which, among other things, offers you the opportunity to save the current setup and look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to get this window again later, use the Options... and then turn the window / hide. this process is shown in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images in case you don't have a filter. an example for this can be found here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be created as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it will be shown in the picture viewer. if you haven't opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview window. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the delete button or select Edit Selection from the Edit menu. now the window will show you that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; it offers a solution for this problem. you can also use it with & kphotoalbum; you can also have the images stored somewhere, thus & kphotoalbum; you can record the view of & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all the pictures you need can be uploaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images where the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that & kphotoalbum can show you the preview of these images. however, you can also not view these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and re-copy files. & kphotoalbum; so if you want to avoid hassle, how to avoid messing up your pictures, please buy a larger disk to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those you want to make for others unapproachable and click Recent View in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also select all the images that your little sister can see, and choose the menu entry Everything out of the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to determine which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item pictures lock, which prevents all images that you have locked. if you want to get the pictures again, click lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply change your password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand all images on the hard drive and on the other hand can read out or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to fend the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason has & kphotoalbum; about a picture _ and video viewer. these can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the top part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure which information will be displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser will display suitable entries for this. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser displays all images of Anne Helene. as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have uploaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the keys Picture high and Picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and End. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it is possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the entire space on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can drag in and out into the image. to zoom in, you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. the plus button zooms in in the middle of the picture. shows the zoom-rectangle and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point-key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the power button sets the zoom, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomatic operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Rotate the image from the context menu. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current image using the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view the Cancel and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you might prefer to mark the image and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking on the corresponding letters. in view, you will see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set the features on your pictures, they are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you are editing, printing or whatever you have selected, just add all of them at once. this is described in detail. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you can view categories in the preview view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you will be allowed to paint it on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch will not be saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can reverse your gemon later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to finish the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the image from the pop-up menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not complete, but documentation to & Povray; should you have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select single objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is displayed in the wiremodal views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or choose a menu item in the menu Insert.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will appear, so that you can select the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">By deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right-click context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have modified the properties, click Apply to Apply this Changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can rectify the input errors and click Apply and discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture will be rendered, even if you want to render a submenu item (for example, a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), check local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can move these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as an absolute value. objects are only displayed when selected or their level of visibility is smaller or equal to the level of visibility of the scene selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need another arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a view, pull the Anfasser to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the passer to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored at the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to order multiple views over one another, pull the Anfasser in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the map tab at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to loosen a view from the anchorage, pull the passer-down on the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the panel bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the sidebar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them in any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with view window ordering... saving. it will display a dialog where you can save the window ordering under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them render. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon The icon Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu item View Viewing Scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode matches the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes as you like from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View menu View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every Render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the picture, select the check box subsection and enter the frame of the picture to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality drop down selector you can select the properties that & Povray; for rendering used. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection illumination. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User's Guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">These images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling corresponds to the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because every pixel is constantly divided further and adaptively because the depth of the recursion depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray uses a ray for each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a specific additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the values exceeds the threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually pursued and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you switch on jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last adjustment for the quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have not hit the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminates, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray player, select the File Import menu entry... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet complete command set of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this will add the source text of the object to the opened text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Copying and pasting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can add source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, it will open and post-modeler; the & Povray; User documentation to the displayed object. here the path to your document and the version. supported are the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example height-field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene file, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the scope of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects, such as the ball, you can set the level of detail for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you tick the high level of detail for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an advanced projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you tick the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you tick the floor, a floor underneath the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a checkerboard pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. values for depth and threshold value can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window instructions. in the window instructions section, you will find how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created by pressing the Add button and deleting a selected order with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement. new views can be created using the Add button and deleting selected views with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column create a new column on the right of the existing windows, with Unten anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you get a map picture view together with the previous view and floating anchored the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere at a level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpost-modeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Edit Delete. this way you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. when you click on it, see the object's contents in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the User Documentation to & Povray; see more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points in view with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you apply the user button or push button, the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you will see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert finite bodies quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the user button or the input button. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the plane, even at the moment only as a finite level. if you render the scene, the plane stretches to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you view the object tree carefully, you will notice that you can fold the item for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the settings in the object's view.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but in the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first sub-object. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = ground pigment), with a click on the button Preview how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the look of materials at any time with one click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the header and sphere in the preview, just click the Apply button and preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your picture right now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. select the color list entry in the object tree. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the Object tree, choose monochrome each time and change colors in the object's view:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to do this step by step, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input key or the user button) so that the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, set a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose the Most Subobject and change the name for example in ball Pigment. click Ball Pigment, then dial Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effect and reflection already result in very good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options you can & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but nice scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen the rendering of hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects like fog affect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Open a file. in default file dialog, you can select a file that you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you still have unsaved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the recently reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Recently.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or override an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option set-in short commands for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for setting up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodelers with this option; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to simulate harsh surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump-map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give color to a pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can click on & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set if any image should be displayed in your own window, or if all pictures should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Enter or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may set up existing multimedia buttons in such a way that they function as & Amarok; -Shortcuts. this will make your keyboard to the & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">Amarok's DCOP interface has many general functions, most of which are also found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlists and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script whether all the required modules are available and use the dialogue so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require'Korundum 'rescue LoadError error =' Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kDebindings v3.4 is required for this script. '' kscreen --sorry '# {error}' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the base for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow execution of external programs and commands. in most cases the function exec () is used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events if there is no use for them.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist uses the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the workfolder to the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackPlanet indicates that a new piece is being played. the script could now ask & zb; with DCOP functions more information about the new piece can be retrieved (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume displays a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. to add an entry you can use the DCOP function dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; exit, or if the user stops a script, send & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar) which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2) .bz2 so that the user can clearly identify the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension of amarokscript. for this reason, you should correctly name your script packages.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to obtain the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is complete, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; append. for your entry to kde-apps, you should use the Amarok Category; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus. you might also search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Perhaps you already have a few playlists, but you can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlists browser is just the right thing for you. and if you still find it hard to choose, the dynamic mode and the smart playlists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music. Amarok is smart, sexy and chic - just the right thing to experience your music anew!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>

<seg id="1216">Save Playlist when saving, save the current playlist automatically when you exit & Amarok; enable this option if you don't want to lose the current playlist when you exit.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keeping the current piece visible when changing the piece causes the playlist window to roll up / down to keep the current piece in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Switching to the context browser automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust & Amarok; s appearance. the section is part of three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting your own fonts, the otherwise gray presented section will be activated. you can select fonts for the following area: playlists window, Player window and context browser. press Select... so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify on which screen a multi-screen environment the OSD should appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The Audio Output Folder Card lets you select an audio driver from the selection field. some drivers still activate more settings in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder that & Amarok; to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, check the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting up, how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. you have to install kdelibs so (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager holds the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but Fluxbox will work hard. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, as these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by checking ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and recreate the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1246">This is mostly due to the fact that taglib is abnormal when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a little more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of the libraries used by & Amarok have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable ATM when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least use no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail opens automatically when a crash occurs). if it is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the Meta-Infos, but do not mark this as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only an empty playlist appears. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the interface intuitive, the start subwindow has been converted to the Statistics window. you will find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for the rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device has to provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to pass audio simultaneously. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or via the dmix module for Alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause problem and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify another sink (eg. sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">That's what & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first decode. you can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just want to hear a white noise. GStreamer is reading the file, decodes them and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open sound & multimedia sound system settings. enable sound server with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>

<seg id="1331">& Amarok; requires the installation of some software packages. the required packages are listed below. additionally some additional packages are listed which make working with & Amarok; more pleasant.</seg>
<seg id="1332">If you install these packages via a package management system (e.g. RPM or apt), you must also install the development versions of these packages!</seg>
<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, also & Amarok; a player window with the most important features. in addition, & Amarok; however, has a playlist that is superior to all others.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok; be used, including the creation of a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window is a running text display showing the currently running piece or current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time for the remaining playing time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch from the available Analyzer by right-clicking on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; -Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, enlargeable window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are located under the running text display. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set up Equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the slider to adjust the piece position or volume. playback / stop playback and switch to the next or previous part using the playback buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most developed playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that it does not exist in any other player. but don't let the wealth of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be shared in two main areas, on the left is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right, you find the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser shows different information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, Text and Interpret. these three subwindows are later explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the subwindow is dropped off. the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be collected in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow Music displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the performer and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and beside it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to track the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png will be treated preferentially. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will play immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can specify which information should be displayed in the music subwindow. to do so, right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be worked out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, & Amarok tries to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if there is still no text script running, you can choose which one should be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only group the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. records or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are sorted by artist and thereunder will be a further segmentation after the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Sorts by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will be displayed first by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button, you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-capture your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes for using this filter can be found in the section about the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter is a selection field, with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours up to one year. of course, you can also select your complete collection, which allows the filter to be switched off practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will empower the current playlist and add the selected pieces to play in the currently valid order.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to Playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on one entry, you will achieve the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function will add the selected pieces to the queue. this will play next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as playlists. you'll be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to Media Player - Add the tracks into the queue for transferring to the Media Player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this performer / Burn on CD - This will send the selected pieces to K3b and either burned as data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and lets you change tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Move files to the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark the compilation - select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears among different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Picking up a compilation-marking - changes the album marked as a compilation back to a normal album. afterwards the album will no longer be shown under different interpreters but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes use of many playlists very easy. among other things, it also contains Intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. these are used & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection, which have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Intelligent playlists are possible. click Intelligente playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow Media Player is used for the connection of & Amarok; for example, to use your portable media player (e.g. iPod). to be able to use your iPod with & Amarok; if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the upper list view of the Media Player's browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the performer list. if you're done, click Apply. thus, the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, exit & Amarok; and solve the disk connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">There is a search area under the toolbar that allows you to search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because all the files in the file list are hidden, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">For example tar: / home / mike / musictar.gz and press input button, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be tricky by simply dropping files. in this case, the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply moving the entries with the mouse to the desired place. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. if you enter for example one two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you type OR between the search terms OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example all pieces contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then include the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: review: &gt; 50. This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign ahead of the search term: -something is searching for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bad. this searches for all the pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include a comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by holding the Ctrl key pressed, and then right-click on the entries in the desired order. the entries then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button, which you can add to the playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons follow undo and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the tool bar is a unique, larger analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted by clicking the right mouse button on the analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu like that which you get in the player window over the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example rendition controls and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbars...</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces. in addition, the status of shuffle mode and retrieval, a slipping tool for the playtime position and the playing time of the current play is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do this, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the menu in the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry opens the window Visualization plugins. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok;</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool for managing your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the interpreter on the left.</seg>

<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & quot; applications also, equipped with an & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script for example.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the more comfortable program kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, so your taste and the type of your task will be decisive in deciding which of the programs you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP functions, you need to make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following to the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; -program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts that are described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVDProject () void format.dvd () void burnCdImage () void burn.dvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject-Method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface listed above and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface that can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>

<seg id="1495">& kaudioseeker; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many encoders that encode these wav files (compressed). currently lame for MP3, oye c for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) is supported by default (These coding packages must still be added from the Linux distribution). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudioseek.cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if it is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions. however, only the encoding packages must be installed that are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be invoked so often until a suitable configuration has been found), then the daily handling is explained on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you can often stumble at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Opens the main dialog of & co-creator; with different flashcards (like encoders, for setting up the encoder). here you need to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences are less important, since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will nevertheless be included free with most distributions, but there are open license issues</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but slightly lower quality compared to OGG at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playing equipment is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto stereo systems. today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate around 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music from youths, portable devices and car stereo equipment. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which is manually entered or fetched through the program from the freedb over the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / used with & kaudioseeker; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; adding titles to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & co-creator; parameters needed (= knob of a button in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter the information so that all the others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translation: this is meant by the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudioseeker; is actively using a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it appears, the e-mail address is not used when fetching the data from the server (but only the programmer may know who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if it is set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readout program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that you will use cdparanoia; if you want to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs; see that you have to install the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution first if this hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oye c (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codizer package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined encoders. more information about codiers can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio coding of your choice (lame for MP3s, oye c for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; read out. we will use lame '--preset Extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">Both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine since it is considered as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg by trying to copy something in it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set-up of & co-creator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the code to be used to compression the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them on every reading of a & CD; if once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; -dates / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM can be displayed; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. here there is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is loaded / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only if you have incomplete information, select so that you will be notified when information on creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected during reading the & CD; it must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry found, starts immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with a low risk if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & k; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind that if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. you can use freedb locally in offline mode if you want to download the database before. however, this is over 620 MB big, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in the offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, as many firewalls are bucking the protocol 8880, maybe there is more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transfer data to the freedb server. to disable the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of concurrent pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time at just an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, please tick this to check the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you tick this then / must be specified the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. if the box is not enabled, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Type everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is approx. 224 to 256 kpbs. the compression factor achieved is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the '--id3v1-only' entry for restricting tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously coding WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just have the basic set up of & co-creator; finished. this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change them again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard drive. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, was built in the previous section, as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from that for a & CD; with successfully fetched data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually input data instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, now the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screen shot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, please consult the Questions and Answers section after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window created, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually invoke this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the internet, you will need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: CD-Editor - Input the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the 'Current Title' field, the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the input field 'Current title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments inidividual per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen shot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v2 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & on audio creator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can later modify the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see Help to the Kodiver to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the ending CD; in this example, this is not important since we don't transmit the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org website and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap, for example, can be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. please enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title dates of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the BOM.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check sign before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece one or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Has been started by clicking on the selection button selection of the selection process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab order to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right below the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You can see this error if you try to work with a code that you haven't yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded have been marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we typed here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it's clear why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, out-reading and coding parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order is placed in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time appears in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">If you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window into the & kmid; -window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you draw it to the & kmid; (in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played sequentially.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows on the left and right of the template and change the speed of playback. to get back the original tempo, double click the speed LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a print affects the space bar like a print on the button Pause or the selection of the menu entry break in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, start & kmid; play.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text events, others use lyrics, and others use both. some pieces do not have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events should be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically calculated, which uses a song so that you don't have to manually set up the karaoke text. however, you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"" "if you want to set a certain type of event, select" "" "Text" "" "from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2." ""</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files, which you can summarize. in this section you can see how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the collection under the item Organise.... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. in the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the one you want in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. keep in mind if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song using the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece will automatically be added to the active collection when opening (using file opening or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then add the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on removal.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, the next song entry from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To bounce back a song, select the button Previous piece, the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the key arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, as it is not saved when leaving & mid;</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano series into events of the Change patch to Trumpet type, which will always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you don't need a MIDI-Map, because all sound cards GM are -compatible (including Awe and Gus cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all necessary replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the keyword section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the requirement for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of the Keymap..." END Define Keymap "A more key map..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not general-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, you can specify how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the right side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you can not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all the sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which sounds similar to a gun fire.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60 regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term Trommel patch the patch is meant, where each sound represents another percussionary instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not the one at which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keywords for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"" "" "" "keymaps" "" "are used mainly to map sounds on the percussion channel. take a look at the included key maps." ""</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on Channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap must be defined further forward in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio specifies in which ratio pitch-benefit events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-benefit event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM says that a keyboard that receives a pitch benefit event with the value 4096 should play a note higher. unfortunately, some keyboards are trying to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; try playing around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI-Map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these pianos you see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button no longer appears green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the Channel View menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Accept, therefore support & kmid; Drag & Drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable automatic add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have an & K; Desktop a & konqueror; -window open with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a karaoke file) or started (when I play a karaoke file) or when I want to play a file, simply switch to the & konqueror; move windows and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn the automatic add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files Amid, B.mid, and C.mid. First you only want to play the first file. so, set the automatic add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.G. and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, this encourages me to program on & kmid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your soundcard. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links from the bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played by one another, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you click on an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and the play begins with the attached entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can also be changed by an editor. by clicking on a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select Playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and modify [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be inserted easily.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end-animation, so the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation may be displaying a favorite picture: & lt; smilgt; & lt; bodygt; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet "/ lt; & lt; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here the path can be set from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc, like setting up the backend per mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even include the special box embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file Assets of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and after error messages related to loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order for a given backend to be taken for a particular mime type (of course only if this is ascertained), this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can be played by TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be seen, you need to use the device to be used and the TV channels. to do this, you can use the scanner from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port is to be used. there, ports should be detected, of which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">As the VDR support from KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (presumably this way of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). therefore, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be functional. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>

<seg id="1765">If the search string is used, the elements of the DVI; file are used with the editor and as soon as an element is clicked into the DVI; file, the exact opposite of it. as soon as a section in the & latex; source code was clicked, the corresponding position is displayed in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master-document, work with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick Construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is to be held in the same way and there is no call of & eyepiece; after the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit tool bar, the three large selection boxes should be noticed. the selection fields have been developed for quick introduction of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the fast structure of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Further is for inserting items such as tags, notes notes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: this command creates a name for a section, a picture or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (select a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">The author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & bibtex; and & bibtex; and & bibtex; files can be written nately also in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ empower is used for the definition of the lettering. it can be used to specify the font documents for the main text, notes notes, etc. the following font documents are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, there are two choices available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentwill contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] determines the font. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also happen in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s building or the quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compiling of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. when using fast construction should & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the letterbox e 12 is created and only a few things should have a different font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only checked inside the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes in an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold printing, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the document.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for italics and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or other environment. a single word in a set can be shown italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex; drawing language was presented, then follow a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a little text is entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. at least a quotation, a few passages in bold and italics and a poem should be applied to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor again (with the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (English D e V ice I nering). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step, after clicking on DVI, the document can then be printed using File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the transformation of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into woven other formats can begin with the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The search query allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides an appropriate setting for all & latex; -Binding files. only Modern under Settings box... Tools should be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to complete the search query, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicked on for preview search. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer is then made.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document of & box; open and set to the corresponding line. to do this & Kile; in & eyepiece; in & eyepiece (setting up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should an error occur when using quick build up of the & DVI; if an error is present, it will be shown in the log file or in the message box.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file indicates the error source in the source code. in the editor, the buttons of the Previous LaTeX errors and other LaTeX errors can be used for jumps between the errors. the log file always specifies the line in which the error appears. to view the incorrect line, click on the error in logging and & Kile; jump to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template for the document to be used. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When choosing a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. for more information, see the section below.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a new document, some strings may be replaced with other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in the box... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {article}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; -files. if a simple way is used to create a template, one should search for one on the Internet and follow the steps described above.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& cate; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made directly in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and to experience its possibilities, the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start working there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference which can be called via the help of LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; can be used as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that in this way, if you click on\\ par of\\ bigskip only\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse and highlight the different kinds of source texts. for example, the & latex; -commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can include additional jump marks. these are an own type of bookmarks within the text. the menue edit jumps or the corresponding keystrokes make the jump to the next or the last jump-mark. this is also highlighted by this jump-mark, so that it automatically is deleted at the first entry of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; although & kate; already offers excellent possibilities, have been added to & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; and therefore supports & kile; special commands for their selection. under Edit Selection, the following commands are included in the text selection:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heals a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning is not meant by tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only exploiting thing in & kile; is that the abscesses are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Select the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also reads & latex; commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & kate; provides the keyboard shortcut Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands for faster possibility. under Edit Remove the following commands to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. definition for a paragraph in & box; it is included in the description to edit paragraphs.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for more commands under Edit surroundings for a better simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, skip to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, skip to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the closing of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or inside the command\\ begin {environment}, skip to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering multiple associated environmental commands, you can quickly get the overview over. this command encloses the last opened environment so that the nested environment structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups defined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, skip to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, skip to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the buckling clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located in front or behind the shredded clip of an & tex group #, the group will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups of parentheses, it is possible to get lost in overview quickly. this command encloses the recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex, groups is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotes are used as goggles. for the purpose implementation is used in & Kile; the sign 'for two simple quotes' is used. & Kile; knows this case and provides two complete quotes for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic double-entry sign can be set up under Settings Box... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use specific settings (e.g. German or French), so that German or French suits can be used. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When shifting from shift; input key for & kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is in a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break, but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>

<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offers a good source code complete, this has been extended in & kile; for special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic adaptation. all these modes can be set for different ways under Settings box... Completely adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment is added by the command\\ begin {environment} & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} to an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When you click the back button, the last letter of the entry will be removed and this will allow you to delete the complete list. on the other hand, the list may also be reduced by typing a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed by selecting a command. alternatively, jump handles can be inserted, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by editing hock marks and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Kile; Comprehensive options can be made to these lists. it can be used to select different clock lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as opening of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for the complete damage of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin and the calling of the complete destruction mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for complete damage to environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the complete stop mode over the menu Edit Verily environment or the key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment automatically starts and it appears\\ begin {. afterwards, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & Kile, realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; Set up... Kile; Comprehensive options can be made to these lists. this mode uses the board list of complete destruction mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; supports user-defined lists of readouts, which can be replaced immediately by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings box... Example.cwl, for example, contains the file example.cwl, in which, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS -files are not as popular as PDF files, but provide an excellent basis for changes and rearrangement of pages. if the PDF output is specified, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the result of the work, you need to compile the source code. all the tools are groupwise in the menus to compile, create, and create view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer and eyepiece; or the other conversion can be used with Alt; 2 using Alt; 3, using Alt; 4, the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and using Alt; 5 the PS file can be viewed.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins that & quantaplus; lastly, have with & quantaplus; even possibly a little to do. this allows the plug-in system to benefit immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the plugins in & quantaplus. the plugins can be used in a large number of & GUI; elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plug-in or a KPart, we will start editing the plug-in menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all included plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a storage location & quantaplus; this path for searching the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project involves several people in a sort of hierarchical relationship. & quantaplus; supports the indication of team members and they can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by searching the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of their own identity are important in terms of news and annotations. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that takes a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the Event Configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email will be sent to the addressee selected in the Recipient list. the addsat can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">To insert notes is simple. it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a commentary area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the nickname of the team member, plays a role in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-insensitive, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up using the Quanta settings... This dialog covers some pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behaviour of & quantaplus; with regard to tags including code completion can be changed. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">"" "" "" "large / Low case" "" "of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal" "" "literal" "" "means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tags XML files." ""</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: uppercase / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal / lowercase means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>

<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags except for the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Update start and finish day automatically: when enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacing of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detecting different types of files. by means of button Default, defaults can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created files or other ways than opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is stocked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is stocked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can either be displayed in the Editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the default window settings back to the default when the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the MDI modes and / or mounting views. it is equivalent to the --resetLayout command line parameter.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the area of the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structural tree setting, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the updating of the tree can be opened automatically when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element is found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The Abbreviations are grouped in groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s valid. this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause Abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">The plug-ins can be administrated here. plug-ins are KPart-applications from third party, which can be reused by any part-capable application, the most well-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not located at a standard such as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load Component in read-only mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only Lese-KParts generally refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then testet & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, it will be possible to save the entry even if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it will later be installed.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus, from version 3.3, the troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. the support for the non-necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger-plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plug-in is available that supports the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserting.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the options next to the Debugger-Plugin in the drop-down field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default, when a project is opened, which requires a debugger, so in the normal case it is not necessary to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to send a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens, while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debug request is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is stopped, execution proceeds. if a request is given, the execution begins as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, where it is checked incorrectly in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Tells the debugger to pass the statement and go to the next one as if there were not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog allows a variable to be entered or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; provide support for Markup- and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exists in two types, family 1, markup languages and family 2, script languages or & CSS; s consist of two parts, tag and descriptionrc; and tagXML files with extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic toolbars of image buttons (above the editing pane), insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details of the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day. the descriptionrc file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars enable quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag Folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag Folders bear the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares if they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but one element type about itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the method method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has an ordinary attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only happen once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling in tag editor dialog and attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouping together the elements of a list. it can only happen once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & lt; Note. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; text &gt;. this will not cause leg breaks, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog above is in & quantaplus; start the dialog and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, verification is only performed when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 day XML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 tagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overloading function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "string" status = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is also fairly simple and there is an editor for attainable via DTD processing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Transitional 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD indication. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) Nickname = The simplified name of DTD. (HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... to be created. click New Action results in the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut added to this action. by clicking the user defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner, the current shortcut is removable.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text will be inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even are the quick start dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in your path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we substituted with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is substituted with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used for controlling & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can receive input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, directed to the standard error output. it can be specified, what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the value of the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any given case there are not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the Markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "complete all and if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it, activate" "" "Edit Tag" "" "dialog if available to allow input when using the action." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics More programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the icon created does not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually distributed as loose, starte, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this symbol will be inserted; -tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it must still be associated with the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions specify... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, if there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some common & quantaplus; add functions to toolbar or it should be shared in multiple groups for a better overview by some separators. open the toolbar to set the dialog on Settings toolbar. make sure the toolbar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element which is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After new XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust its & descriptionrc, so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded when a file is opened from the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user, it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you might be in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has already done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc / language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files, for example php42 / # elements in the main index top element = your description for these documentation, for example.</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element Top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the shaft depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & lt; Note. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; scripts would display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of text-separated context elements that are to be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your Docrc file just after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then, create a folder (as specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example which documentation was used to & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an UE-mail item input, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) with email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions will be checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and user-friendly for publishing. in order to make a contribution we recommend to sign the resources, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked about their passphrase for their private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The upload can be uploaded from the DTD DTD Package (DTEP) menu, upload tool bar toolbar, and start the context menu of files and folders in the Template and Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, researches & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signaling. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be canceled. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears indicating the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be required in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Download Menu and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file using the DTD description to be used. after that, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions: the string that will appear in! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: when enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand them and to be able to gain full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them close to these concepts, without their understanding and quantaplus; little useful.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; all that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be all from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the index cards with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, recharge, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area leads to another context menu on the edited document contents, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the tags under the mouse cursor, or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the tool bars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is used as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want a single day, e.g. & lt; pgt; in their document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now, you can enter the data for that just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (such as armature), you can fill in a dialog boxes.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow to navigate, open and roam information in the information. in the presentation with index cards, for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage the files in the project by right-click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be carried out with the contextual menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">A further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, parts of the program, a whole website & etc; All possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. global Templates are always available, local templates are always available, local templates only for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view one shows the internal structure of the active document. by left-clicking of an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking of an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refreshment of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can easily change attributes and namespaces with it. its content-oriented entry system allows changing all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two tabs at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. thus, for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab displays all the errors in the up-to-date document. & quantaplus; -Scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a tool bar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed text archive on & kmail;. if they receive a tool bar in an email, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus; like any other.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of & quantaplus; autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and do not execute here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting with & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for KDE's surface. & quantaplus; optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML-editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus, an independent, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; for it the appropriate & IDE; to be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be kept that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why developing what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; -scaffolding is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more details, see help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; or run helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and served by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes each time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check in the section on templates. if you are trying to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted when pasting from the clipboard there are special characters to & HTML; enrolment so that they are properly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard to & URL; enrolling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the Anker tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to / from. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if you & PHP; script executes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message box or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">On and off the problem-reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the column icons to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear grouped in the menu according to the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from hard disk. & quantaplus; -projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows you to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, manage the project. in chapter & quantaplus; -projects you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Create a dialog to add a new toolbar. it just creates the name. actions must be set up by setting actions... saving toolbars. toolbars are stored by toolbars toolbars or you will be asked when you exit if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables upload tool bars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; which has made you or anyone else and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD;. is useful if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML,) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu item in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current creation dialog if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu Tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar refuses to comply with the rules this day.</seg>
<seg id="2143">"" "in the" "" "menu" "" "menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on it. clicking on an activated plug will deactivate it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the type; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-end identifier. very useful if you know people using other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries the switch can sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the index card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindows mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaplus, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting a entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Toggles the status bar on the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window to or from.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Depends on the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; for details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or add which ones and modify row sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in the context of the mouse cursor, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as e.g. after filling the project name the whole directory structure is completed automatically for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name of the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name, file will be filled out automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and defaults to templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. when a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project. you can select multiple files or entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you would like to download and change. in case of serversing scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Be checked if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is restarted from scratch, do not tick.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an accurate selection of goodies.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hook-up hooks or, by removing the tick, clutching out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard comprises three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the subwindow Profile or with Shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignor are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by hopping up their own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the Team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn event actions and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a particular event occurs, such as backing up a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus, the last project that was open. you cannot influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project or Symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialogue project will be displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus, closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave similarly, but the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the context menu calling the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button is displayed to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten by the user. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather insecure password on the disk does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-load profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a full qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored in a veiled manner on the disk, so it is not easy to read, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and toolbars. it can give many views in one project, i.e. by simply swapping the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the project tool bar in the Project or Project Toolbar, accessible via Settings tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to the own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are the best. use and add are different. adding toolbars is discussed below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which you can remove other actions such as tool bar, rename toolbar, or set the toolbar, which can be specified, which actions should be visible on this or other toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can set up in the menu with settings toolbars... and set settings actions.. set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically a common file system with enhanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in approximately the restrictions you imagine for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary Templates are normally included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specialized documents are made in appropriate subfolders. a simple framework for the purpose and organises the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document based on a template, but the same text area should always be included in the documents. you can find everything from a comment about a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl based. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve whole sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As Template Save As Local Template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this has been done, you will notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. check the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template Save As Local / Project Template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with drag & drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used, such as drag and drop, or insert over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on the file tree or in the project files tree view on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal-oriented approach. you can present headlines and footers or link dynamically with & PHP; create, insert files or associate with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">Templates based on templates based in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is displayed as soon as parental attributes have been browsed.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except for the regular folders in the Template menu. if a root folder is set in such a way, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text building block. if nothing appears, you'll probably be in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows preset or introduced text for templates in this folder. this may be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows by copying contents into a folder with special headers / footers to equip an entire presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, you can have a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another by means of context menu (click on it, press right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor, which can be reached through the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document containing & PHP; a small green symbol displays the Vohandness of & PHP; source. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor, it is still necessary to edit the source text editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are both visible in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor, and the cursor is activated in the source text editor and in the VPL; Editor is already active, keystroke the active cursor from one window to another, where the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor can be adjusted via settings Quanta. depending on the choice of VPL, you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to the time span. basically, the recommendation applies: a small gap for fast computers and a large range for slow ones.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this is used to reduce the manual coding. this can be used to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows changing the contents, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS styling template by pressing the file open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The cursor is used as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves peculiarly. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and using the return button or remove button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way as the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it should be noted that inserting tags before already existing identical tags cannot be removed, e.g. when an anchor day, surrounded by text, must be removed any other armature day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the tables wizard or the Listen-Assistant are downlighted. they will later work in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists of toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed the modified lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where maybe only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, lots of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it in one of the comparison slots.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparisons and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-value file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the resulting result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screen shot shows three source files while merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screen shot shows & kdiff3; in case of folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you frequently have to check codes, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make typing easier by using only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder folder folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows for manual typing of file names, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Through the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders is introduced. if a file is selected for A, but for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field will be active and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to immediately set an output file. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog, you don't have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag & drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the thought behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you only need to create two corresponding files, download them in & kdiff3, then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment, you cannot extract anything from & kdiff3; only the drop-down of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret drag & drop of text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse take a while over the line. then a small help window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed by the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see the color that differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the source file has no lines. if the line break is enabled, the line of broken lines is scored.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (under the comparison window) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [changes] when you edit the result. usually, it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to find the remaining / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two benchmarks are used, any difference is also a conflict of manually resolved.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left appears a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes by automatic merging or manually editing, there is no other line left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no row in the queue; displayed. this is only a placeholder for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps choose another source again. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a mark you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy this text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources ignore the numbers or ignore the Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate is mainly using the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, up, down, page on, right, up, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you are used to by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the editing pane, you can also use the other buttons for editing. using the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already explained in the section merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / final difference, the next / previous difference (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl-picture Abandage) or the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you have to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and manual copying is omitted. be careful with this option, as you may accidentally override the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line-feed character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line ends of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically at the end of the game and restored at the next start. (setup Menu - &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic font are shown. if the selected font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be scanned. on these systems, the button Preferences automatically introduces an unformatted color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press or return the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. copying the manual to the clipboard is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can choose which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step, white characters are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, others only store a line feed '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the carriage return characters are made visible, however, like a white character. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. however, the differences are shown, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. comments in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In Automatically advanced mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will proceed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically resolves all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge. look for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you must start & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if this option is checked, the top setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The encoding area for encoding appears to be a short indication of what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since coding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">This also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when comparing three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & lt; & lt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal still a second supervisor column with the information needed.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you'd prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply select the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Classifies the comparison window next to each other or to each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then immediately decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your needs. you can use this function e.g. for removing disturbing parts or correcting the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal preprocessing command has been specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users don't want to program it by themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl are completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line calibration to convert entering capital letters: SED's /\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">The\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another preprocessing command for line calibration. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi erased.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several compositions at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER 'However perl some details are different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal pre-processor are retained for displaying and summarizing. the other operations only change the data that the line abnormality algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal pre-processor, the newline processor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that alters the text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adapt the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and displays the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialogue file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merge. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed of a small message box about current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folders is completed, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on + / -, or double-click on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">For identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirtiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The synchronization mode is active, if only two folders and no explicit target folder are specified, and if the option synchronize directories is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action to allow both files to be identical afterwards. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged, selecting the newer file instead of merging (unsafe), then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and displays the newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. As long as these errors are not eliminated, merging the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While merging, one file is processed after another. status column shows Fertig when merging has been successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When a Full Analysis is selected in the setup dialog box, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unsolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the resolved conflicts column is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then you will use C as the target in the Three-Folder-merge mode, B will be selected as the target and used for syncing A and / or B as a target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check afterwards if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries, select / continue directory merging / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (shortcut). to do only the current entry, select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting file types still exist invalid interaction actions, a message appears that indicates the erroneous elements. they can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the options Browse, Delete and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), a merge window will open (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select Restore / continue directory merge, or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you want to continue merging (F7 key), a message will appear and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. this allows you to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, you will notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) will not work together again later. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Settings menu - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. separate patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-created files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this file system can be configured specifically with a .cvsignature file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a hiding attribute. in other filesystems, a previous score selects a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: when the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned on, the links will be compared to normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; does not result in possible recursions. a link to a folder containing a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders to a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical when they are equal. this can be useful, for example, when copying the changelation date. please use caution. this option is deprecated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables synchronize mode when compared to two folders and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical afterwards. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file will be proposed as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another backup, then the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .orig. If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of individual files, not only the merging of entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder view menu remains visible while merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the window and text windows option to turn off main windows in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between the directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. once you save the result, the status will be terminated and the file will not be merged again if you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory again: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO-slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, Space &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # entered the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then, a file is always accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit any permissions or modification date. therefore, permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (note the Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently as a discrepancy viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in differences viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as a part, & kdiff3; suppose the input file is a patch file in unified format. then remove & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. then starts & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select Preview - KDiff3Part from the pop-up context menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; executed as part, it only supports comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it's compact) already exist. in addition, the name KDiff3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or have to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc).</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines appear next to each other, this is more and more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always recover a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src turns; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of the last changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, see more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have problems compiling. however, if difficulties occur, please report to the & kde; -mailinglists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Removal) copied to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed showing differences. this also causes identical files to not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">When you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, clicking on the button will be removed accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a mini preview of all virtual worktops. it is quite convenient to view the running programs on the working surfaces, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both within a working area and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual worktops as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and moved even on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & pager; the movement is possible both within a working area and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The contextual menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & pager, clicked, the contextual menu has only the two entries pager. when clicked, the icon and the name of the application, as well as the entries Minimize, Maximize, View Desktop and Cover.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & pager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is selected, the name of the virtual workspace will be displayed in & pager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual worktops. if it is selected along with name, the names will be marked with ordinal numbers, eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is selected, the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in & pager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is selected, the running programs will be displayed as small windows in the & pager; otherwise, only the empty working areas will be displayed to enable their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the order of the & Kpager; -main window can be determined: classic lets & Kpager; in a 2xN screen, as from pager applications appear in some other window managers, horizontally shows all virtual work surfaces in a horizontal row, which is very good for displaying on the side on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display windows as symbols or with its content and move it. besides, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & pager; and set up switch selections... let the dialog appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently it is not possible to change settings in the dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you must log in as user root and assign it to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you will need a functioning installation of the KDE basic packets.</seg>

<seg id="2480">& Kmag; is a screen saver. you can use & Kmag; enlarge a part of the screen, as if you read the newspaper a magnifier for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo. this application is intended for various users: this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly updated with new features. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you & Klikes; start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag, shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called magnifying window. the image that is displayed in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window in the following.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & Kmag, the area around the mouse pointer as a moving loupe. alternatively, you can create a selected screen area in the magnification window (dropdown mode) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor setting. please note that & Kmag; currently it is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer into the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the Shift key or Shift + MMB, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window will remain firm and only move the lower right corner.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image to the printer, save it into a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), turn the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the ad update. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Low, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& Kmag; automatically uses your set short commands to store files, opening a new window, printing, reloading (with the button document reload in & konqueror;), Enlarge and size & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag also known as & kmagnifier; it is a screen loupe. you can use an area of the screen, as if you would use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visually handicapped.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse-click as soon as the mouse cursor remains on the same spot. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain. besides, it can emulate pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may also cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and executes a mouse click once you stop the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Move the mouse, wait until the end of the move, until releasing the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can drag the button with pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; execute a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">When Intelligent Move is turned on, the shutter speed (1 / 10 s) is activated. here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button, wait until the mouse button is released when no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function is enabled, a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these moves are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the tab General. there is a slide control sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this option is selected, & kmousetool; at each start of & kde; starts. this function is currently only available at & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the relevant documentation to find out how to launch a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. have you already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last push of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">In particular, the smart move should be turned off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware of what places a click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not cause unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick here is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. however, it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rollers. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. you can scratch the dirt and dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation no longer can stop by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you are using & kmousetool; using another window manager and moving a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can execute a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue executing mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keystrokes. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent move, but I do not manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very likely to mark text, copy it to the clipboard and insert any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you are just starting to use kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. this allows you to use the smart move even without the audible mouse click. however, this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the XTest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; button the mouse cursor as soon as the mouse cursor moves away. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain to be pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time that a drag action begins before the mouse button is released. in this way the dragging and dragging can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is edited before it is sent to speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving pronunciation to replace incorrect spoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker, or to circumvent certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-Dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The display of screen readers is the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and continues these orders. when the screen reader is read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News is the highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that reads messages. while you & eg; read a long text on a web page, you can talk to & kmouth; notifications are also news. read about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. every order you get from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except for the output of Screen readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such pre-reads, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character Chain Replacements replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; it is delivered with pre-defined string inserting filters that allow the replacement of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformers use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in the delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are included for the translation of & XHTML; in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text, or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts. if you have set a female voice on the speakers, for example, you can read text by KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text will remain unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning, or a warning message is sent to & ktts, it is processed by all the activated filters that have been set up on the page below. the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters equipped. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the below installation dialogs are displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For the creation of string translation filters, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison sample. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be exchanged for the related replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily; it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Erbet. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages registered here. click the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl key at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs get you with the program qdbus; the & dbus; -numbers must be omitted. if for example, & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The character encoding filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Diesen filters apply if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing the words, the character encoding filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. words must therefore be limited by separator characters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Expressions can be found in the package kdeutils.</seg>

<seg id="2650">Specify the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is also sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">You can send text to a particular speaker, which is set up on the card card, or to a speaker with certain features. for example, you can specify that texts should be read by kmail from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text is passed to the filter, there is a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected by the speaker characteristics that the program gives the text to & ktts; the speaker is selected and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card card. you can override the chosen speaker with the speaker selection filter.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression. if installed on your system the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^] &gt; &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. if the text complies with the filter conditions presented above, the speaker will be selected to match the requested requirements. click on the button on the right to display the speaker selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts, translate from the source code archive, or downloaded the currently created tarball, and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktts, first check whether speech dispensers work properly with your speech synthesizer. you can use the script-script spd-conf to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of speech-dispatcher; the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the set-up of speech-dispatcher is possible and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into single sentences. the user can leave sentences or paragraphs, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to & ktts, it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have set up a speaker whose language English and its gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen. if you want to learn more about how & ktts; select a speaker, see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add Speaker on Add, and with it to insert a speaker into the list or click Edit, the card reader device will be displayed. as an example, the set-up of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you only have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival. in case of voices, the & ktts are known, this setting is done automatically. in general, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages like Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">These sliding controls allow you to adjust the volume, speaking velocity and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some controls and display this gray, the voice selected by you does not allow these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first set is synthesized faster (with greater memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click on Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window will be displayed by kttsmgr at the start of the calendar. otherwise, after the start only the symbol ktmasmgr will be visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr doesn't work yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD is reading a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the job, the number of sentences and the currently processed sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this row, you can move forward or backward in the order selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">With a click on OK, all changes of the settings (also on the other card cards) are taken over and kttsmgr will be reduced to the icon in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you have to find out which device works with you. in case of doubt, choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card you can set up special actions whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The display of screen readers is the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. once the screen reader is read, the orders received will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News is the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that messages messages. if you are looking to read a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; nevertheless someone who is entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning, or the output of a screen reader, add & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always play when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card only apply to normal text orders. for messages, warnings and the expenses of Screen readers there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktops; keep Knotfy messages pre-read, start ttmgr and click notifications. the notification card notifications appear.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Check this check box to switch off & check; if this setting is not selected, the other settings are deactivated and & ktts; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">If this setting is selected, notifications in which a sound is played are by & ktts; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events to the list. when you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & Conversation; sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IRC message.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events for which nothing else is specified in the list are by & ktts; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this drop-down box to specify what & ktts should do; if an event occurs, you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected a custom text, enter the desired text. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can enter the characteristics of the speaker you want here. default select the speaker that is displayed in the list on the list of speakers as the top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels of events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, it will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of abbreviations. SSml is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktops; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions exist:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice, the festival is used in the output of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100%, SSml text is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-level detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into single sentences. thus, you can start or skip orders sooner or later, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional level detection filters. at the first start of & ktts, a set-level recognition filter is automatically set up as a default. you can modify its settings or add further set-level detection filters, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to get to know the selection of speakers is to try out. switch off the selection of speakers and enter text to read. switch off the speech selection, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you must have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then you can start reading faster, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then hold or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-level recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be turned off, only removed. do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set-level recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for phrases and add a tabulator (decimalcode 8) to the set limits (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text prior to filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), alerts, messages or the output of screen recorders.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from see the normal set-level detection filter, you can paste it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"" "you can overwrite the" "" "Speaker Settings" "" "tab on the card selection menu. the card card is displayed when you click" "" "Apply" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top one on the card card speaker). in other words: no speaker features are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of an appointed speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & tktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that most likely corresponds to the originally set properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"" "select the" "" "Method" "" "to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the properties of the speaker you want. if this feature doesn't matter, don't enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to take precedence over other properties. you can also set several markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a primary feature. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application sends text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the Speaker range, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the Default orator and then use Speakers, which is closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without order number the input is 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr rushes immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get backtracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is an uncompatible version of GStreamer. if the problem is not solved, it is possible to install a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. when I receive a text order, freezing & ktts; ein. on the & Console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is a problem that conflicts occur at ALSA, preventing the simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. see the ALSA project (dmix) website at www.alsa-project.org for potential solutions.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in the festival, but kttsmgr doesn't show that voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice to the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalve / Voices. if that's successful, please send a patch along with the & URL, where you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program sox needs to be installed and can be discoverable via the PATH environment variable. some Synthesizermoduls such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the card card for speaker devices. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for speaking velocity are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; reads. (this is because the HTML is turned into SSml.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; by & XML; (see) or if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSml forming filter, and set up the speaking velocity.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I do not manage to read web pages with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesman, but & ktts; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival does not produce errors, the xsl-file will reject the GENDER tags. the same is true for the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a separate drawing replacement filter and now I can move in & ktops; no more rules set forward or backward. on the tab orders it is displayed, the order consists only from one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) must not be filtered out. instead, use a filter for set-limit recognition instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; sound Architecture). Alsa is installed on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>

<seg id="2768">Before using & ktts, check first if your speech synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions you have with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is revealed. the quality of the voices is generally good, and multiple voices and languages are supported. in many voices, you can adjust volume, speaking velocity and pitch with & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help is provided in the instructions provided with the festival. if you would like to read web pages, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice requires Festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage of development. if you set up the russian voices, you must enter MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone for the voices. select a kyrillic (8-bit) encoding as for example koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux; distributions. look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the & MBROLA; then Festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; this produces the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>

<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the full functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three horsemen:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The network interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed from the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button of the button... to set up in the dialog device.</seg>

<seg id="2811">The automatic mode selects TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, TCP / IP settings for the system are executed at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all the required TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list either DHCP or BOOTP, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection manual can be done without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>

<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphic interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & k is sufficient; not, but in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile and compile. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology is given, in the second, all of the & knetworkconf, configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found major dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact person who has a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen from a dedicated area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, mostly addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, eg. .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own machine). the default route is required for the IP transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you will find the configuration files affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is another content found there in case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is dropped by the scripting in SuSE. another version than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first consisted of creating a surface for tar, which also provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be from & kdat; it can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; pulls back the tape and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. detects & kdat; the pre-credits on the tape do not, you'll be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">If you can't find it, you will be asked if the bandindex should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was included. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be browsed by outwards of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejection of the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change of symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without risk.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape type must be formatted before you can be used to save data. if your tape drive requires formatting before being used, this must happen before you can be formatted before using & kdat. floppy tape drives do not require formatting the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the belt name and capacity, & kdat moves with the formatting of the tape. all the data on the tape will be lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you initiate the backup process, you must select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Safe...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog for backup will open. in this dialog, you can check the selected files once again and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the item entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkout process has been started, the dialog box appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection once again and change the work folder for review.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before reproducing the restore, the files that are to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore in the menu.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band index file using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the newly elected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file, which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; & lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding option of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & kdat, before the tape is incorporated into the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, & kdat tries to lock the ejector at the tape drive. possibly this setting doesn't work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when resolving the integration of & kdat, the band will automatically discard the tape. do not use this option for floppy scStreamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, & kdat tries to change the hardware-based block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape format, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are compiled as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The volume of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the complete name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the time in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be directly administrated with & GNU; -tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog allows; experienced users provide quick access, for example, information on problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system places the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that appear on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, tries to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and analyze protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the syslog server format and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen shot, & ksystemlog functions, with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can easily be filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, it tries to open the system log; first the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not appear, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely not with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for which ordinary users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or string. the list of the log rows will now automatically be displayed, so that only log rows that match the selected filter will be displayed. in the default setting, a log line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry in this place. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the protocol file system protocol, then show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent and / or generated by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as protocol lines of level indication.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to display certain processes (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron Protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this may, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, you can use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">"" "in addition, you can activate the" "" "To new lines" "" "option in the main window context menu to display all new additions to the new lines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you can find more up-to-date information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion Archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly develops to the standard for program start-up when the system is elevated to & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">Here I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might attempt to convert a machine to System V Init without installing a new installation and new formatting. the & Linux kernel first looks under / etc following an Init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a / etc directory instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service that you want to start at boot up or change to another runlevel. system services don't include such things like setserial, which will only be started once. such calls include rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if you don't have much use. you can also set a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port when you boot.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching init at different places and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning section:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you come to repair it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how do you start all the correct scripts now? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if one contains a K, the script is called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that can only run httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user running level, that & eg; & kdm;, network & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or other pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level (resp. stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between runlevels or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry will be removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this only happens if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert it into the target area -- even if the same entry already existed previously in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorter numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to add the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore items that have been thrown into the trash. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired running level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with standard Running levels, and now the machine is constantly reeling. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions, but is unfortunately not standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) simply exit without a message if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. this program allows you to manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To begin with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made any changes you need to save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or save the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings. only if you have limited space restrictions (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can set individual settings. other flashcards will appear if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card appears if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if at least one filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the limitations on the space available in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually adjusted for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The tab groups inform about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group, which belongs to the user, can be found in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group, or click the appropriate add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, remove, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
