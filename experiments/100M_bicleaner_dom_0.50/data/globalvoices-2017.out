although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and pursued his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method One , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was me , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country I &apos;ve ever lived in , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very sentim@@ ental love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me , as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and Women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won in Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number of candidates nominated by the Party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that takes people from around the world , a deeply dev@@ out person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
he did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
m@@ umps intoler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
it still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump pointed his way to the nom@@ inees of Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counter @-@ piece to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps due to his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters to be ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
it is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , maybe they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him .
this &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note D ) : as much as &quot; white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash for@@ eplay , which means the big Van Jones , exactly what America has done so magni@@ fic@@ ently .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ ling@@ backs , however , there is a huge part of the white American saying this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un Khan , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded by saying : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America ? &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what does the Mexican Music School of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community have in common in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which , with their musical instruments , has found a way to overcome poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian &apos;s English newspaper wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs of gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare g@@ lim@@ mer of hope .
young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day after day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village which is located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste materials :
music with re@@ processed instruments , consisting of local solid waste materials , is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the leadership of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez began to turn parts of the waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all made out of the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic MÃ¼ll@@ land@@ fill ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world generates about one billion tons of garbage .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people of C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring performance of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can tackle illegal fishing successfully
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals specifically with international , practical solutions for environmental issues .
the re @-@ release takes place as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already started illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it looked for Africa &apos;s other coast .
the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal offen@@ se of this kind on their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ zed themselves quickly against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls St. Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior member of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at its time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Stop illegal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that then expelled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries who are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by ignor@@ ing existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the worm emp@@ o , with the information circulating between individual countries , the actions are happening in real time , with trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . they can also detect suspi@@ cious routes - such as those that indicate a ship un@@ loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pun@@ ishments , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD of lost sales , which the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i each year lose due to illegal fishing that inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world .
their practices include , among other things , activities such as sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , identifying phan@@ tasi@@ es , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ gaps organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sooner a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and one country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You are not allowed to run my port &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to date , the closed front is working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed bog@@ us licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple dec@@ ep@@ tive identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for comb@@ ating crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to detect the illegal vessels that are willing to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishing companies use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO , who also deals with fisheries data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal vessels with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and by which the position of each tra@@ cker ship worldwide can be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that used to fish without license before and hardly expected consequences , are now aware that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats have purchased more lic@@ ences .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i had helped Somalia to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found on board tra@@ w@@ l nets which were prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also fight illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s latest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October , it launched Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only did the ship operate without a license , and were used tra@@ w@@ l nets which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to the protection of the oceans is actually working throughout the oceans .

her articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; re@@ conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment .
this picture by MarÃ­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void by meeting in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return flight of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , centrally located in the federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is constantly worsen@@ ing , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition , in the im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , saw the chance of a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the reluct@@ ance to re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ founder at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rate is one of the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine is considered the only way to give the country the chance to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance , Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica , or shortly MU@@ D ( about the round table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which opposition parties and political groups joined forces , was to take part in the proceedings against President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . &quot; in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the following day as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , was to continue to continue .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide Civil War and on November 3 all go to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that talk about disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse , are pil@@ ing up on Twitter .
particularly large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , otherwise you can see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the round , representing the amount of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment procedure - this has been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :

others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than to work or to go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an town of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fies to his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba .
in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was okay .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto was not a choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made friends with one of the ERP .
pass just that they will not take you one day and I will have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
at the military base , I had to cr@@ ush papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack in which cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were removed and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he interpreted into an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I spi@@ ed in , and saw a couch that was tor@@ tured upon men .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fixed the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there .
they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water , and ch@@ ased him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... as a dirty no@@ vice .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I recognized the smell right away and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible for a person to do so much harm another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eyes .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied to hands and feet .
near the entrance , people chew@@ ed quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero put together a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to information given by survivors , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was indic@@ ted by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &quot; boot@@ y of war &quot;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as it called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign that is attacked by an enemy that has been fought .

but if you go into a house and steal the refrigerator , record player , clothing , painting , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you , who h@@ edge cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , I &apos;ll find you and bring you to yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do so !
so my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ collar pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes back home .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to cancel .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I &apos;m older I feel regret .
I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you were exec@@ uting people during the dictatorship . but why would the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap your children ?
one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I asked myself again and again : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
it would have been easy to put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom one could pass their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ in@@ able act one can do to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there is always something .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought of displaying my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I bl@@ amed him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all of the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian sentim@@ ents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first indication .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally spoken against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest yet before the end of the trial .
he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 counts : under the circumstances of severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by subsequent death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years old .

the sentences in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been witnesses , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ ances .
eleven of the original 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or van@@ ished during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial place , which is now being led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence .
the photo was dissemin@@ ated in the social media .
edited the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in Kyoto &apos;s Japanese city , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving lic@@ ences have witnessed a very un@@ successful translation last month .
on a shield , the Japanese word , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; was mistaken - perhaps even with malicious thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot;
the wrong translation was available from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in social media .
the mistake was to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ issuing daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could such an English translation be ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t for elderly people and simply unacceptable in an international city like Kyoto , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the wrong English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit not completely correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News made a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ some &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the share of older mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents across the country is certainly a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this equ@@ ates to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
the named Re@@ porter brought comments to light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have opposed to older mot@@ orists :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error received , among others , the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terri@@ fic mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So badly the translation is not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to transfer active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the original language - native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers wishing to learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in @-@ house . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .

machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the per@@ ver@@ ted and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases that arise from machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true in some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English formul@@ as in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more accurate translations can be expected .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a rep@@ utable source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television take on
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also survived recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups who oppose the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was cap@@ tioned and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites are banned again .
this is from the @ vi@@ vo@@ playlist web page .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission on T@@ elecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
I have subscri@@ bed to @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net with no cable TV and informative national TV channels .
it is astonishing that it is cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ Fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly delegates their meetings .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique that the DNS servers answer requests for certain domains .
if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server responds incor@@ rectly or refuses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , was dis@@ continued on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera operator El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who was transferred to the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was arrested .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV was on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay a lot of girls become slaves to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by Cur@@ ative , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from university , she once again returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become of something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never was treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay there are more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children will have to pay for countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract you cannot lift .
this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ lla - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated against Cri@@ adi@@ te guarantees in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they should complete their education , improve their position in society , and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; can be transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not receive education , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon occ@@ uring in sec@@ rec@@ y in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households was seen , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of violent be@@ atings .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra moved with a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered a fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela headed the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , rooted deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered than children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined .
without documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a quick investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case is in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be trend @-@ setting - for the first time in the history of Paragu@@ ays a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go came to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to sign in bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in her employer &apos;s house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went back home and had time to learn .
the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time it had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve but also did not receive unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ isers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the master Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand next to him and read editorial articles such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they felt I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , belonging to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would once again speak their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment that Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I could not invite anybody to go home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which to share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atric girls in Paraguay .
the Administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the area of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the cham@@ fer@@ ing in the ad switched off once again :
dear friends , I found one . I look if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .

bill writing Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
Pix@@ ab@@ ay image , altered by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is accepted by the Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must be registered with a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the law , a job would be set up to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users would have to register with their correct names and identity card numbers on the website , in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could result in a penalty of up to six months &apos; imprisonment or a fine .
the draft legislation consisting of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs and is used across the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video @-@ based and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration . unclear is also how they should make up for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ler , member of Parliament and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a user name and password from the T@@ elecommunic@@ ation Ministry in order to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Senior Research Engineer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them into court .
technically , this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislative legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the Parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no diver@@ gence is present on the image surface , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y , MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y , proposed a life sentence for those who would be found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an Region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which fights through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on the fact that a big predat@@ or exists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in sheer joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for northeast Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an unusual pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and neighbouring settlements Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forci@@ bly evacu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture has yet to have a nuclear accident , even so , alone , 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows from the local point of view what progress was achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper comprises statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
the housing estate in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare @-@ houses ( in @-@ the @-@ world , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light .
nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , one still tries to reloc@@ ate the evacu@@ ated of temporary shel@@ ters ( as@@ says , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to final substitute buildings .
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate still lived in such shel@@ ters .
nearly 40 percent of the people evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ations , which were hau@@ led after disaster in shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung was able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools , which were affected by the disaster , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 per cent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are back in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have affected extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear black@@ out zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can have here only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to make a living .
is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her feeling has changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk .
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed found that still not enough was done in disaster prevention .
as it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also intensified its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the mighty earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to witness .
of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 thousand people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 some 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand , still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ated people , who still live in shel@@ ters , are older than 50 years old . they are well known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when you meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat topics that in reporting often get less attention than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after he was beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva in a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 , this week was delivered to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had struck him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . across the country , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
physicians operated on this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
the picture shows the face of the police officer who attacked with a sho@@ al . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s noted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident by the active service .
the pictures show the police officer , how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his striking stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer would be beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen for six months on television and the entire oppression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs rush to him shortly afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the Mat@@ eus family living in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian rel@@ ays ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police brut@@ ality . &quot;
the drawing was divided several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have sab@@ ot@@ aged a occupied school with a gas leak . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a punch .
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only country in Brazil where it came to brutal police deplo@@ y@@ ments last Friday .
polic@@ emen sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber floors and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by directing the focus to another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their title pages with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
you also have to acknowledge this if you are strictly against any form of property damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation course with the police . &quot;
the Lost Villa@@ ges in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular community of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ es , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mills , despite the fact that there are no significant sugar crops on site .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
after succ@@ eeding , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are still in operation after a long period of in@@ active time , because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene recalls to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became intol@@ erable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left the factories only to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tons ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories came , more than 65 million people received their full wages for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be obtained , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it dealt with officially auth@@ ored documents , which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ sat and the date .
everyone was signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to appro@@ ve every decision .
from then on , the responsibility was transferred and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was in charge of his will to lay down the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part that he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial sector of Cuba and the most important work lat@@ ent has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president looked in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better , when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to fuel them , they also ceased to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , and this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other establishments .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they have been replaced .
without a prospect of the future many young people left the region .
a food mill was created in the area , the production of which is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nin@@ ety @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ os a month to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a suppor@@ tive person , yet he does not forgive the lies he told him .
they have tor@@ tured him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into retirement for 65 years , not because he lacks power , but because he is f@@ aded .

as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop goes on with the fact that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever they do in mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway of tears , a stretch of road in West @-@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always speak the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ lean oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to keep my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go ahead with our youth as well
so they can do what they have intended for the Creator
in the comments section , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contribute and add the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and is re@@ published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic courts are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( all @-@ in @-@ one ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance to the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( which is to be seen , &quot; Plas@@ tic models of the dishes &quot; ) are issued by any food that is served in this restaurant .
customers see themselves in these plastic courts and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend turns it into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic courts decorated mobile tapes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supply is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we have also made this part for the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that keeps your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phones and cell phones allow you to create your own work of art . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon che@@ ating is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
is there anyone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell with salmon ro@@ gues ? &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic courses can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands of dried salmon .
further qu@@ ir@@ ky plastic courts can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , which is to be held .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi neighborhood , which is devoted to supplying the restaurant industry , for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and inter@@ ro@@ g@@ aged persons appear on a regular basis only in statistics , but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with them .
the reporting of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely supp@@ ressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the communities that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly those stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches out secret tom@@ bs for his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on one single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have asked ourselves to go and look for tom@@ bs , according to the people whom we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother who is here with me .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are entitled to my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where are we going to get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
we must not only show the faces of those who fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state leadership .
the project is based on stories from readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known illness and sensation@@ alism for some years now .
I pass the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or look at this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness , when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ iled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four @-@ month black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals have black@@ ma@@ iled money from their business month by month until they end up not only destroying the business , but also torn down their families .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , as you do not know when they will dec@@ eive or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days , whether crying would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation @-@ drawn generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks from his home , saw the bloody body of his father , shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence by organised crime and the fight against it ming@@ led with the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government of Public Safety and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to per@@ sist .
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication , it has been mis@@ guided to use trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to death .
officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses including a cinema nearby , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses burned and stolen cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were not know@@ led@@ geable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das ist Nigeria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ User Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of cor@@ ded bodies lying on the floor while people watch them .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo was taken up several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically of atro@@ cities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and shr@@ ub@@ s .
reports have been reported , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Res@@ idents to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be depicted .
the cause for the attack was also unclear , but the military service point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ carri@@ ages ; Africa Check has documented arrangements for Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
another step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely link the picture from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a Blitz@@ krieg , published by the United Nations , those who flee could flee blows , rape and many dead , some by burning .
while others reported the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news site , which in 2012 mistakenly claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein was said to have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source had also wrong@@ ly attributed to Th@@ an being this statement , but had not brought the picture out of DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false dec@@ ou@@ pling go back to the year 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch of private sites , platforms of social media and community , as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have re@@ directed false reports , occasionally others have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have limited examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage and linked them to the respective countries based on which page they were published . by doing so , we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which have also been inter@@ connected in some cases ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases that can now be completely detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting or fal@@ si@@ fication .
the Grey countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a threads on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

true or false ? ) .
one side , which makes rum@@ ors come up , questioned that the said photograph shows Christians who were killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this post , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only names the ho@@ ax , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ Ã¡n qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in Northern Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica quotes the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report contained the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
after the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one here , who used the picture from DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; there are clearly no sides such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this .
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the faulty use of the picture since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , then promoted through a post by U.S. , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .
Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate . &quot;
this article draws attention to the continuing hard@@ ship of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar but quot@@ ing the work of an Indian Express article with the image from the DR Congo ; the article of the Indian Express had not contained this picture at the time of publication of our article .
Greece , 2012 . &quot; people had to pay for a great deal !
it was a collec@@ tivity in the midst of a celebration of a collec@@ tivity . it was a collec@@ tivity in a collec@@ tivity .
the sho@@ cking photo you &apos;ve ever seen ! ) .
this page used the picture as evidence that Muslims killed Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this asser@@ tion was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fact check page in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
an association of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims via the N@@ asi@@ m news agency and used to illustrate the picture of DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
an inhabit@@ ant of the district of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o of Tren@@ to posted this news to his side in order to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shown as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , with a twe@@ et expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ egi@@ timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used , as the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of what they came to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately in@@ scri@@ bed news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judgment , which has only been published in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors running H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to set out that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; fluor@@ o@@ dom@@ es@@ thesia Pre@@ ferences . &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) .
this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox community , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein arrived in 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture will continue to be included in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news site An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , which is now deleted , has explicitly stated that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a similar jihadi@@ st attack .
when the picture was put into circulation later in the after@@ math of the 2015 B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture of DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events which took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and ret@@ we@@ aving more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message which was supposedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it false .
from the embassy in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( in grey ) also points to Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the craw@@ ler and isolated they have picture file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only considerably after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may eventually bear a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assass@@ inations of Christians by Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ estimated in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot believe these images any longer .
with social media , there are tens of people who inad@@ vert@@ ently take part in drinking the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here , for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ tise readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot of discussion about violent representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used by the context or in a totally mis@@ used way .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog named un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mar@@ a ) .
but everyone ob@@ st@@ in@@ ately resist@@ s every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s words from Van@@ u@@ atu are found in the blog , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they care about you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you have been war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ y other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page still want to publish more of these &quot; inv@@ ali@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are highly appreciated by non @-@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite songs here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ agi@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have gone over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster headquarters of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were missed because of floods and mu@@ ddy sw@@ amps .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations .
the rainf@@ alls ceased on Saturday ( 27th May ) , and the water levels in some areas were slowly declining .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flies ag@@ grav@@ ate the den@@ gue crisis , Save the Children warns after more rainf@@ alls are on their way .
this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the air force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are made to transport emergency supplies for the inhabitants trapped in their flooded villages .
various organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue team need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call + 49 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call + 49 7@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 7@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Taxi call App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ y Centre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key , which resulted in more than a thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides .
the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need in safety and provide emergency measures .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restoring norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend .
I trust in her my four year old daughter ; she puts her trust in me to her children . she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we still call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we will vote for trans@@ gender rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others cann@@ y slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they dis@@ cour@@ aged me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t look alike all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like me do not fit in there , will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
to be mi@@ tig@@ ated
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you get into mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day when he died .
but in the Western image , the religion of Rum@@ is was wi@@ ped out , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them .
I have been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , defective narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narr@@ atives fail to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who are moving the movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil of Afri@@ cans that were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh men and children will become the goal of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just a fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
which belong to 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims , in the highest degree , constitute the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

approved use .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother made her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan reas@@ oned the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were sore Muslim and Americans .
but am I now the ins@@ ane Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I don &apos;t joke , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and mis@@ information experts who have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia insi@@ sts in more than just a stranger who r@@ ushes down the head of a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the US , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our belonging .
it attacks our identity , which is so broad , so versatile and complex that it is impossible to fit into a drawer .

I want to explain that .
I was born as a Muslim but a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim , if it could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , if I held her in my arms , and she would whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to the protection that will seal the Quran and call the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

approved use .
belonging is the image of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; how they win a competition of the art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi Saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ ght , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - was colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire , &quot; which a company has founded on behalf of the Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien Company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only master .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved use .
belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while writing books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an ad@@ mon@@ ished his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he was not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans all have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped from a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir subject of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled into more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy hits the United States and the suspect has a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means to know that two hundred years ago , an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means calling Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ came the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion brings more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this ambig@@ u@@ ity .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in Muslim registri@@ es that started with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its borders with people from just countries that are bombing it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which mainly targeted Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs that we are throwing off on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University presented a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faulty and dangerous expressions that we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who exist in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet given them ; now they have mastered large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an ir@@ responsible Muslim .
things I have left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb line in my speech .
things that may evo@@ ke memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity constitutes , a story may lie where someone is made to &quot; another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where but Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people are being enth@@ ron@@ ed by creating the &quot; other &quot; in public perception four decades ago was even a scientist of Stan@@ ford himself .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions , as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we did not have a president who bombar@@ ded chocolate cake while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to other &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban diversity
story telling , by fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the uns@@ ur@@ pass@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been running events since 2015 , is the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world &apos;s languages can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it often is connected to understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate , to feel , to touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , historical narr@@ ators first introduce their history in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even though the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their dedication and representation are leading to the fact that the audience is att@@ un@@ ed to it .
they call forth laughter and emotion , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language da@@ em@@ ing . during this round , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of Rab@@ bit and the Pa@@ vian in Sh@@ ona language from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling performances .
Puerto Rico calls for the US to re @-@ establish sovereign debt
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civi@@ c organizations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3 , 2017 ; the march started with the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ os Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of fixing debt have also filed a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt are responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that operates in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ mailing and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not deal with declining pension payments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand immediate action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the island - not integrated into the US territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization with no party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on civil responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside imposed measures will run without the participation and conviction of citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risk to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the book , which was published last year and is available roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what are the real costs associated with .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el had taken part in a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 , they were contacted by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and conditions remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry For@@ mer , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes was more pres@@ cient than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recre@@ ate the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civil@@ isations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles f@@ use with local traditions and Persian influence .
Bass@@ el could not know at that time that ten years after he began his work , the IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet completed this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I &apos;m overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in custody .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually keeping one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens during each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the angu@@ ish of the prison
and I will enter into every detail of your voice and words
whom I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes farewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year goes by , my soul
while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has van@@ ished more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of force were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has called for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption condemned director after release again on previous post
Mos@@ ambi@@ ans responded with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to work in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed .
The@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and together with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 together with four other defend@@ ants .
the money came from public funds from Mozambique &apos;s airports , whose advice was taken by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his rein@@ statement to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement issued by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , who submitted the application , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to re @-@ establish his old post , as the company did not carry out any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action is good .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to revi@@ ve the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the company should have introduced disciplinary measures against the contrary .
the company apparently remained silent and did not cause appropriate legal action for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , an important voice in the social media , re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it served .
he could keep paying talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence .
re@@ pul@@ sive !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political science in Brazil says that the director is no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the mor@@ als to return and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the State , but instead only served himself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself had become tired of this man who was charged and eventually sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ t prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind him that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison . Mos@@ ambi@@ ans will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , overl@@ apping and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man should be able to sell the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambition , his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison . he was 10 years old and released .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the web because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored in order to express their use .
in addition there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written in Bur@@ mes@@ an &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ lower ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ kul@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ki@@ cker A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were several reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before all posts are extingu@@ ished , which would be suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting b@@ sen ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who dissemin@@ ate hate speech get a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who dissemin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ words is often a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to er@@ ase his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to let my Facebook friends know that the word is locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from reading , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not meet the Facebook Community standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a multip@@ licity of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems as if they started doing this without local context or technical support and banned words such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now laugh at Facebook and do not consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch a Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to check if Facebook removes the post containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also encourage violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where there were thousands of disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the out@@ growing hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better , more in context than on code concentration initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago finished with the child marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should forbi@@ d this practice , so that the age of marriage is now 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age did not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention on Child Protection &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the min@@ ors as , every person under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 were 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at abol@@ ishing the laws of inf@@ ancy followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome .
however , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms to tell the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , condem@@ ning themselves for their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition led to tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators posted a status update on Facebook , which posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the Bill against Child Labour was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and not one single one voted against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws on the children &apos;s marriage had finally been am@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lov@@ ell Francis &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who is a minist@@ erial office in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has hidden the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the inf@@ ancy is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , her@@ ding news !
the law of marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
conclusion Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who openly spoke about the importance of the adoption of the law , noted :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years , irrespective of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft for the amend@@ ment to the Act was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties agreed to have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chil@@ ds are no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # Promoti@@ ons@@ ag@@ ei@@ ron@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organisation .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , should the law be adopted , and he seems to dissolve his promise .
while the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al Ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was quite lawful for Mahar@@ aj to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
rather than speaking of the problem that we invite the state into our bedroom , instead of talking about the fact that the state , our daughters , protects them that they may be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the inf@@ ancy in various gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .
hack@@ ers control the office of the prosec@@ utor against national protests on the Russian National Day

on the eve of national demonstrations against corruption coinci@@ ding with Russia &apos;s Day - the Russian National Day - the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website was hack@@ ed by Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l district . hack@@ ers have left a wit@@ ty message &quot; Sta@@ y home .

at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the side - however , in the cache , it remained preserved .
it &apos;s # conservation gone
on Sunday , the office of the prosec@@ utor informed the local news service Y@@ ar@@ news that they were hack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia which is based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series resist blocking .
although many tech sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using circum@@ scri@@ bing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN @-@ pre@@ valence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia recently , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ators ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of the legal ban .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports on its efforts :
after listening to the news ( via Wikipedia ) , we do everything to put sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . this is the way to read the content in a distributed and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was conducted independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ Site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ pedi@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey .
because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ urred with badly positioned motives and washed colours .
this motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring the animal world to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him with his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just came home when suddenly I called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to gn@@ ash pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know , for he stood facing tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book seemed to appear . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he gaz@@ es at me through the sc@@ arf trees ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and spent most of the time in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ tern at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could take a picture of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organisation from India .
a revised version has been re@@ published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women are avoiding the utmost care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a was convic@@ ted by a false court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relative with a name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear , if at all which , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une area , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women including health personnel and house@@ wives , a unique club , became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ ba@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and campaig@@ ned for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has worked for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices , such as children &apos;s marriage , to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected individuals , and manages these clubs .
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion round dealt with women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open a discussion about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to say al@@ oud the names of their hus@@ bands , is a custom they all maintain and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without mor@@ als .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try at home at home as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to initiate discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us what they want , does it mean that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that she only gi@@ g@@ gled in front of herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole bl@@ iss@@ ful fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an old custom , the women decided that they would actually attempt to call their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got sc@@ ared and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic point on the forehead that indicates mar@@ ital status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hall@@ u@@ ber@@ red &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; point if he would do it too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing him .
the other women have not stopped altogether , but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days .
for many women , the disc@@ us club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every disc@@ us club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , for the first time in their life , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I &apos;ve never talked so honestly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are linked to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only carried out sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ war @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt across a p@@ ant , they didn &apos;t dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own dress selection , the mor@@ als coupled with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will do it .
to the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far , we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continues to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead at any time .
the women in the disc@@ us club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a patri@@ archy &apos;s sacrifice .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it &apos;s not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a day of commem@@ oration
Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the Beat@@ les &apos;s official YouTube channel .
on the 29th of June this year the Day of the H@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war years .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noticed in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here soon became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes reached its zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day in Japan .
even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places that are related to the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the Link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
and of course , some companies also use the fan community in terms of market terms , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les @-@ memorial day .
and what a day could it be ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat no@@ od@@ les in Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to run .
so , we hope you are here !
&quot; &quot; &quot; follow the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ash@@ tag &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done , to learn more about the Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be attacked by attacks in Mozambique .

a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for wan@@ ing purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the bodies of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man of bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , declared the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia der BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight against these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , the Mos@@ ambi@@ an police warned about the latest assass@@ inations of three men of bald due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ bitten Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ spec@@ tra@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of men of bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ deca@@ i , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably ab@@ erg@@ istic rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , generating wealth .
in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of B@@ log@@ gers &apos;s poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty in which Mozambique faces :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ MA@@ NY BE@@ ING WIT@@ HO@@ UT A country where people would have shame to go to the streets , dressed as if they would be ashamed of taking sex against good marks , work and other services , a nation in which people would rever@@ t honest workers or even take their lives to gain their bread , a land in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald men will be hun@@ ted for ab@@ using purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , the scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique , and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both head of the district Mor@@ avi@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ faced :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ inations of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .

a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding the public &apos;s access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting of Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who spent themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death but did not give any further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the open web movement will be the honor .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations who have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the last five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced late June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threat ) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , China still receives calls from the international community to release Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , po@@ et@@ ess Li@@ u X@@ ia , or permit him to have treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ med up some foreign reactions .
United Nations united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure in order to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated .
Norway , Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , despite the fact that the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the import of salmon to China since exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to fetch his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also urged China to release Li@@ us as she announced in a statement on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to elev@@ ate all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want him to have the possibility of treatment abroad in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy asked for a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley said that China should offer the couple :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , on which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have just launched a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government forward to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can go into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Peking of the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns whether the whi@@ rl@@ wind of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and get in touch .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom of action for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France , France
France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a declaration on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information on whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan , Hong Kong
the Council of land@@ ings in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who employ peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu , of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very worried in a statement on 28 June around Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land , one can say that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a duty of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very clas@@ sy : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal &quot; countries , given that he appeared inevitably un@@ democratic .
it has , on the other hand , defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , as well as cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re emerges from author@@ itarian rulers , who preten@@ ded to be democr@@ ats , abandoned the twisted logic , because it fits better to their power .
in the end of the last week Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system , really non @-@ answers .
he warned the corresponding questions with non @-@ responses of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clear his mind as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to elu@@ ci@@ date this point as long as he was paid highly to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore .
by publishing its commentary on the blog , An@@ on points out that it should begin to read the complete tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
when he said that Singapore was not a country , he obviously did not mean it in this sense !
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard that I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another matter .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that is correct and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam made a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian or@@ ator ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , are we only seen as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore going back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet &apos;s cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of grave importance .
why do the people of Singapur make their military service , do they defend only their city but not their country ?
who has to pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink human identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is , and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country mainly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the myth of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice Canadian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series that reveals rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world and to show another fac@@ et .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , Editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question I asked most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I have been living in Japan again and again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions .
&quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly against anger when they &apos;re kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans expose a Canadian flag to their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I started travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; obviously we often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter if you &apos;d conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
mit Adam from San Francisco
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be di@@ ligent - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , soft but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian double @-@ Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) .
if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can b@@ ump into .
being harmless is to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to make no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major property of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
we lack the warm , open kindness which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice &apos; . our prime minister has made Canada quite sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dy the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 has seized power and , despite its promises to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of what rules his girlfriend does .
although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded to Facebook has been shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief an absolute discretion on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change of imagination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people considered by the jun@@ ta as a critic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other revi@@ e@@ wers of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit in the army was also set up to monitor the online content and prosec@@ ute persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand fights against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there was a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta still pursu@@ es is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pa@@ yers .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment warehouse , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison terms , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band that im@@ itated the tribute of &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only re@@ covers itself very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ sh@@ ava are located in the Co@@ al Bas@@ in of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Min@@ or , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the region .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , mostly Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ek@@ ho@@ v@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are decay and rarely are they inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native elderly man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded glory buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ov@@ ka , which houses one or two families , is recognizable by the balconies where linen is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they retreat instantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother told us that we were allowed to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , it &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( farming of agricultural products for personal use ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not have to leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia in order to live with her . &quot; my heart will forever remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia was simply broken away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets around $ 9 child &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once located , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time it lost its anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and everyone lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation turns towards the end a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him afterwards .
he plays with the ball , which rolls down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones onto the ruined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure that they live in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on April 19 , 2017 and appears here with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and gold @-@ colored ear rings in ted@@ dy bears .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - despite this , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , the people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings her to hospital if they are ill , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , she massages them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children there .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is common for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the track and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests often send their text messages when they have gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ular .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family visited migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive .
he has started helping them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ular are coming from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez told me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ee he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Afrika , everything is full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , the travel@@ er quietly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ ma she smoo@@ thes in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ we@@ eds that she has made a lady , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she introduces her to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have gone on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an District of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app was able to identify and prosec@@ ute sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online sc@@ ams , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reports on digital cens@@ orship in China mainly focus on users &apos; experiences in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often dark for those living in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often submit extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately as to whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notice required the people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you may be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are meant for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in addition , published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , indicating that the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobil@@ es in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the spread of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities and institutions connected with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office when they operate their computers and communication devices .
an up @-@ to @-@ date report by Freedom House , a US human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to let all residents and entrepreneurs register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ishments for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and notice that you are completely alone in a place where all important things have disappeared .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable , both from the inside and from the outside .
one that gives honour to their name .
one that has fallen into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if reality takes you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth continues on the axis of the un@@ holy . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone erected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all districts desired , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that is stuff@@ ed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence , shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I listened to my voice by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we were al@@ lied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations fully and completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it is just not interested in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow it - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed them all the way up to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his eyes filled with hatred lay on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are sad to see me in my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest maintenance that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word about what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put it in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and His Father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture that I was subjected to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I passed through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I take care of all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have allocated me a bigger cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must share it with only one prisoner , and immediately let me sit without waiting for her permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : beating the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earth@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , there is no visible face to me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him if I stayed .
a li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to drive out all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear it shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams are ring@@ ing every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light presented to us by the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; reference to 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be inter@@ ro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the security of the state from us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ out map and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view .
this is not a house that is no land here ; it is a curse that they call co @-@ existence to turn the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life when you join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and strikes have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , though I had done nothing to make this penalty .
of punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , probably originating from the kno@@ bs .
your exec@@ ution@@ er delights in your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t with@@ hold your cry .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t bother him enough , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t find any favour , which is why he was next to an electrically charged bar .
electricity f@@ lowed all my body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body , lying on the ground , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be worried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move away , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian ra@@ pper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sl@@ ings to his screen , sometimes to his computer , sometimes to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the upper floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ a@@ ye@@ es ( e.g. Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks her old @-@ tried opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape music .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and according to his own statement , he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he is jeal@@ ous of American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in water Nes@@ cafÃ© poured into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot jun@@ cture has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the chim@@ es of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ vering of the K@@ ent ci@@ gar in the nose speak of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan drink - not to land in prison .
recently , the interior ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some members of Parliament supporting the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ tal singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ted the cultural and traditional norms of the country and was the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MEPs and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled due to the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that question the proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement probably should not simply be plain rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b resi@@ ded traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have been mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently bent unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen .
she is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
over the past few years , the number of &quot; hon@@ orable massac@@ res &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official out@@ war@@ dness .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ours reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence .
according to a 1954 crime against crime , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be kept in jail for an in@@ definite period , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family &apos;s guarantee that the woman will not be able to do anything .
even H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from subjects that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been told , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edward sat &apos;@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song one verse is repeated conspic@@ u@@ ously often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Y@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , in order to notice later that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and his opinion were cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly adverti@@ ses the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ wa , a poet of the eighth century , still alive thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ wa , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph later , was able to write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can &apos;t Jordan do that ?
the real problem , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tic realm , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
even recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association with the reason that they have critically critic@@ ised the problems linked to the corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is just the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he is not only dre@@ aming of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ ficially created demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is thought that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many regions of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the flo@@ ats , drums and dancing were passed over more than a thousand years and came from a time when armies from West Japan were mar@@ ching to the north east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro @-@ Ga@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high carriage was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans trade weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rarely external appearances and personal hygiene were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser &apos;s .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ ies and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the Fris@@ eure &apos;s competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there , experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and instead of bad advice to obtain training in hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their achievements :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children .

precisely this question left the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ a and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Ges@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
only recently , their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the sign@@ atory of the agreement of peace was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal detention for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons round the clock , must now be integrated into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now enter their ranks and support them in setting up a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to join together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters in order to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each one of the former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who are to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ a in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who desper@@ ately need them .
he plans to share his love with people who needed most of the most urgently .
so the plan arose to write letters full of hope and support to former fighters of the F@@ ARC who now find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on March 19th .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ arrived in the camp to deliver the letters personally .
the F@@ ARC members set up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former soldier led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of refuge where gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL she@@ ar laun@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Palace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of war , he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms .
so far , I have only learned how to handle weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices against new voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the F@@ ARC leaders declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State imp@@ acted the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated , were people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bians had been prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but that is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now rel@@ ying on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ ova and whose initial publication took place on the OC Media website .
homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region face a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by the LG@@ BT@@ Q community over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community not only arose overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that deal with the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities det@@ ecting suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and hiding them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt that she was actually a woman .
when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ et@@ ch@@ enen heard of the sex adaptation of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
fear@@ ing for her life , she ultimately moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organization .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App did the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was reading a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still dish@@ on@@ our the family , you wre@@ ck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital .
apparently , some women had everything to be heard and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two bite wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which ambul@@ ances have you been laid - in those of the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , my man@@ ly name stands on it , but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running through the streets above ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was just bad talk , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke my mo@@ m on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only cor@@ rupted your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around his neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , a car was standing under the window with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was a bit rotten .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to disclose their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bought them without registering , without knowing anything . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in security just because you left the country ?
our people already know what hotel you are in . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender balance , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when chat@@ ting with camera , I actually bother to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for me , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had spent one and a half months in Ir@@ gun .
he told that no people were arrested and tor@@ tured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all of them could scarcely wait for the end of Ram@@ adan and he did not exclude a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine said there weren &apos;t very many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or have you got a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;m just quot@@ ing someone who was in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think I was already known in Gros@@ ny before 2003 , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
seriously in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally brought us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Defense of Sh@@ aria never spar@@ ed me a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the language of Ch@@ echn@@ ya there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never defeated .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking about morality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how people in the city started to change .
he who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , gaz@@ ed at you at once with suspicion .
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic continuously worsen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activities are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I discovered these people myself when I cl@@ apped refuge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to white with foam before the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have whom , the Cab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , there are them - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims entering the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think about the number of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be precise , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all for that - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months , there has been a strong rise in suicide .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 with@@ drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video made on YouTube held the moments when he lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could no longer do anything .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have offen@@ ded .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is based in the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy seized power and had great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable crops for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population gets little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , famine and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime is ref@@ using to systematically ban the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , re@@ directing water from the Arab territories to the Persian lands , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are diver@@ ted .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k adolescents now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job will finish the primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school , and 45 % have university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist , resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
as officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers , access to employment opportunities in all sectors is deprived of the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home , Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first name and last name in order to hide their affili@@ ation with the Ah@@ wa@@ zi , as even Arab names wouldn &apos;t be tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists are al@@ armed before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ TV Creative Com@@ mons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women - who refer to themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - are frustr@@ ated .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even place well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all fem@@ inists in general .
for example , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still make sure women meet a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still going through the many different countries and denom@@ inations .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I suffer dou@@ bly and thre@@ ef@@ old .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to talk on skin color , racism , black c@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention what kind we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to keep silent .
however , all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; sing Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; in order to reach equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to mention that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or above all , black women and women from other ethnic and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement as a black woman who refuses to consider injus@@ tices in their thinking , which relate to the sex and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for belonging in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , so@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in their speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I too refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a de@@ mented and marg@@ inal@@ ised being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural assimil@@ ation in order to drive forward their ego@@ centric agenda .
I will no longer try to close white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to instruc@@ t them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that has been established for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of using myself for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming tales ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining our own way . and not only that - black women can create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and where the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life neither b@@ yp@@ assed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article is re @-@ published here .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Water@@ borne Alliance - a subsidiary of Water@@ borne Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia von E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of collaborative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities , who can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ ative . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # escap@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ lt ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ wife , who had become violent against her .
some time had passed since the end of her relationship and the police said that her statement would be put into action , but more could not be done .
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed ab@@ uses for ill @-@ treatment , the acute indication of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez also avail@@ ed nothing .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her display .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women make an adver@@ t at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must report at all to the prosecution authorities .
content 1 Stri@@ ps and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing below 3 Paragu@@ ays rules : good approach , poor implementation pun@@ ches and statistics
it is difficult to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that do not even point to the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the available numbers are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General launched 9@@ 600 ads because of domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 displays due to domestic violence among the peace courts . also here , 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements came .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women claimed that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who is reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but then she gave up . this should always regret her .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she inherited the psychological violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable :
I never thought I would ever become a victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had failed so long ago and did not leave him before .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay in order to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case , everything began with psychological abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a process against her former partner , who developed into an imper@@ me@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but are not used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ as ( # fÃ¼r@@ st ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain and punish fem@@ ini@@ d on an independent crime , as is the case already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text was modified in some points to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay , can be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original bill envis@@ aged that most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) costs which the victims of violence must wear themselves if they simply res@@ titu@@ tion and want to receive a secure property to impose the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ eff@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for this :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here , a re@@ thinking has to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators get away punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to refund such a long ad until ill treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , sections of the law had been altered . among other things , a passage was canc@@ eled , which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions on the changes are going apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .

independent media continues to attack attacks one year after the ban on a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been closed due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Afgh@@ an authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting of corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he served as a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were arrested and put on trial , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had deposited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , alongside his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of the sul@@ tan is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , especially the secret services , the freedom of the public , including freedom of the press , interference and torture of human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper reported since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , announced that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties to the H@@ ands of Justice &quot; was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a ruling in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Az@@ am@@ n Facebook page
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited by ISS to the special department and arrested at his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief , You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief for al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on any path , including online , starting on August 9 , 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial was held in Mas@@ kat before the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state &apos;s pres@@ tige . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ bian ri@@ al ( US $ 7@@ 800 ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to dissemin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit was set up in the amount of 5000 Boli@@ vian ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central Pris@@ on in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , serving his annual sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the Korean government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was extended by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again challenged the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to allow the publication of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was viol@@ ated recently in Oman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to set up its operations .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the Afgh@@ an authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) ur@@ ges the Afgh@@ an authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman imp@@ eded their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit , non @-@ governmental organisation that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is seldom or even not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the offer of the global healthcare system that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists themselves helps build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the Serbian national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens .
GM : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain the recipients instead of being a creator himself .
the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
Q : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , space research , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed producers change global food production &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems all over the world .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ standing Gor@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents are not only applied to individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , special red or green tones or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the last few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . due to this trend plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds Sal@@ ad , but he now needs longer because his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a rock is lying in a river to which I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this right now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far to Sal@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce because all the features are already patented . &quot; so he continues as good as possible and tries to identify those features he wants .
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breeding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ at of the Out@@ standing Gor@@ geous in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( open source seed initiative ) is inspired by the movement for free open source software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them .
however , this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not to use it immediately - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
dark prospects
for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , he says and takes on the increasingly frequent mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , the latest examples are the mer@@ ges of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which are being offered for example on farmers markets , should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others , as opposed to pat@@ enting seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is always limited .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all anti@@ ques attributes are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to use either at all or only difficult .
there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are in even greater style patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a Ques@@ tion of View@@ ing
plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such as they thri@@ ve in certain environments and can withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is declining more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the altered conditions due to climate change are much worse than ever .
in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property protects other breeders as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting patents and protecting plant varieties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
such protection does not hin@@ der innovations , it also promotes them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees the other : waiting for a patent for 20 years , certainly does not foster innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow crops that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton is disturbed by the concept of pat@@ enting plant traits : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the traits ourselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds its own values .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , are needed for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides , breeding into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they manage most smaller seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for salads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that Bre@@ e@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks as if I was with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you have been protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it easy for me to make it quite easy . &quot; worldwide feedback
although the US seems to be a leader in Open Source , the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , implements an open @-@ source seed program . to preserve the seeds of traditional crops , the centre is working with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also helps them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , so that the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , explained that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
one explanation , however , is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide open @-@ source seed system for which the official starting signal is scheduled next year .
a consortium of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has put together a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a global alliance of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation , and others .
the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially been paid to where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make it clear to people that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still locked up content on the internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on them .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abi@@ ding in spite of this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are actually defending the law to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , it has never been as important as it is now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , for example the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network originating from Qatar for alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human Rights Organization of the wave of website locks has fallen victim to . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to FE@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no longer able to access Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for non @-@ accessible websites and media for Egypt .
now the blog , which he established to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became even the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Canada blog is given a home , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting on the student protests and taking a video , as the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government and reflected what it means to him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blo@@ t of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs , and any other web site for which I worked .
2 ) They have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the courageous walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities locked 133 pages from May 24th to August 6th . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
in addition , af@@ te documented the blocking of providers by circum@@ vent@@ ing Inter@@ Net cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice suggests the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that might have access to Egyptian users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are argu@@ ing .

day after day newspapers are reporting in all Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old is shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro &quot; is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the Army , Marine and Air W@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and a ten@@ se financial situation , the threshold of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city will now be published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that are happening in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision is not a cause for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security there are 8@@ 43 sites in Rio de Janeiro , which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write :
we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions to cover up .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against den@@ oun@@ cing violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for those in charge of the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of public service .
remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Cec@@ om@@ elia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to statistics from 2015 . these are the latest available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia emphasizes , has been repe@@ ating the state security policy for many years .
these security measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police depot and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
for several years , however , according to several reports of sh@@ kan@@ en and repres@@ sions against the poor communities that the newly created police unit should actually protect , the U@@ PP is increasingly under attack .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux translated from one of his articles in 2010 explaining why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio will also result in serious consequences for the people .
this demands the state to use means and ways typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
a week ago , the police passed the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
Quelle : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib are currently around a million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians , is particularly affected .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume , on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these areas , controlled by rebels , have been under siege from Damascus , causing residents to rely on locally produced or tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ achiev@@ able for large parts of the population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said against the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of fung@@ i because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years has been fighting to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; awareness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to teach 125 families to grow fung@@ i , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 4 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions originating from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before veri@@ fying their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom @-@ yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms all over East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom breeding for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breach of the siege &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
dis@@ sem@@ ination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the North of Portugal this week .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 injured in the wake of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in Gali@@ cia , Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is only in 4 districts no fire .
in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some pictures shared by Twitter users :

numerous videos spread on the net and show pictures that allow for better insights into the events :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as much as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ eig@@ l of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal stated the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria there could have been a similar tragedy like in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the local authorities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced an e@@ asing of the law allowing construction activity if the applicant had resources to protect himself - that was an open backdoor allowing everything to be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Jo@@ Ã£o Gra@@ val in the same article of P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us drew attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily flamm@@ able wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread ever further after fires of this kind .
these problems include that the website of the Civil Defence Act of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when inhabitants searched for information or attempted to contact their relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial on this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the server did not resist the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the path from Afghanistan to successful entrepreneur

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair .
at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say that at that time , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was supposed to break .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af was again in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was difficult and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little reward and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself to make a living .
back then , as today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in a deserted building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating there . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we don &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af had left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
at the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that gave food to aid people twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin rates . it is true , however , that the conditions to find asylum seekers in the country are disa@@ strous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be withdrawn for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible way of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after spending several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years some Afgh@@ ans have created businesses , among them dres@@ s@@ making , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp restaurant in Pa@@ du@@ a ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s aims extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim to return to the country that he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and manufacturing techniques . &quot; this way they can sell their harvest sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .
citizen report : draft law dra@@ fts from Egypt allow the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the clearing of the camp of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ural Report is an international snapshot showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that shows that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after a registration with a government agency .
users would have to register to use social networks within six months of the successful stat@@ ute on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and identity number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or the settlement of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which has been applied by 60 members of parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another MP filed a legislative proposal introducing harder pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a high official .
under the law proposition , such action would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , such as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who were demonstrating against the military coup led by the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 prot@@ esters , who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison for a judgment date .
recently , his hearing was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan has threatened the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , the apparent burden of , among other things , the possession of weapons , illegal assem@@ b@@ lage , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza answered the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous case , from 25 years to 5 years .
inter@@ ro@@ gated Tunisi@@ an activists with si@@ ghted documents
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ gated to a si@@ ghted action plan . said plan is provided by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would warrant officers am@@ nesty to the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption .
this document , published on April 21 , on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the President &apos;s plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nom@@ ination of his sources , stating that Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he witnessed the case in the district court in Tunis on 0@@ 9th May .
will China force the users of social media to submit their identification ?
according to new regulations of the state council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share messages in social media .
in the rules , it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts predict that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments into conversations within social networks . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to only sel@@ ectively enforce these rules in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ an@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of the distribution of information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the state government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this term is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services for removing content and comp@@ iling it upon request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ isse@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has block Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court decre@@ ed the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as locking in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the indications that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication admitted that the site had been blocked because it became &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups in order to impose a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain may not stop s@@ no@@ oping around
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor , de@@ cryp@@ ting data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted tel@@ cos and intelligence services concerning the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation is still ongoing until May 19 . reactions and proposals from members of the public may be forwarded to the Ministry of Internal Affairs .
