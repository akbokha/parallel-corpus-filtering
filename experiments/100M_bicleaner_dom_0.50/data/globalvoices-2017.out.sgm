<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and pursued his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method One," "" "It was me, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country I've ever lived in, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very sentimental love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in Republican primaries was the highest number of candidates nominated by the Party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program that takes people from around the world, a deeply devout person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">He did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Mumps intolerance also contrasts with the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise counsel helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump pointed his way to the nominees of Republican Presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counter-piece to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps due to his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook those things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters to be racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, maybe they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man looking down with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "whitelash" (note D): as much as "white against all other ethnicities," white and whiplash foreplay, which means the big Van Jones, exactly what America has done so magnificently.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trlingbacks, however, there is a huge part of the white American saying this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Khan, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded by saying: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America?" 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "this is now a" "" "trump" "" "country," "" "said the message." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican Music School of Vicente Guerrero Community have in common in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which, with their musical instruments, has found a way to overcome poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian's English newspaper wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse of drugs and gangs of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">Young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day after day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village which is located at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste materials:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments, consisting of local solid waste materials, is produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the leadership of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to turn parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, viola, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all made out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic MÃ¼lllandfill) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world generates about one billion tons of garbage.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people of Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspiring performance of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can tackle illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that deals specifically with international, practical solutions for environmental issues.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release takes place as part of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already started illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it looked for Africa's other coast.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal offense of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized themselves quickly against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do everything," "" "recalls St. Kiilu, a senior member of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at its time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Stop illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that then expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries who are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By ignoring existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the worm empo, with the information circulating between individual countries, the actions are happening in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. they can also detect suspicious routes - such as those that indicate a ship unloads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay punishments, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD of lost sales, which the eight members of the network HISH-i each year lose due to illegal fishing that invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, activities such as sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, identifying phantasies, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-gaps organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "sooner a ship could fishing illegally and one country could say" "" "You are not allowed to run my port" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">To date, the closed front is working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 investigations of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed bogus licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple deceptive identities and it has tracked and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for combating crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to detect the illegal vessels that are willing to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishing companies use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO, who also deals with fisheries data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">For example, some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminal vessels with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and by which the position of each tracker ship worldwide can be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and pool their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts have a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to fish without license before and hardly expected consequences, are now aware that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats have purchased more licences.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped Somalia to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found on board trawl nets which were prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "they also fight illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i." "" "Safety is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's latest member country Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October, it launched Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only did the ship operate without a license, and were used trawl nets which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into prohibited waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "said Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to the protection of the oceans is actually working throughout the oceans.

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's impeachment.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture by MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="156">Published under Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="157">After the government rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void by meeting in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the return flight of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions of MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, centrally located in the federal state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation is constantly worsening, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition, in the impeachment of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, saw the chance of a fundamental change; in the end, however, the reluctance to re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-founder at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rate is one of the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine is considered the only way to give the country the chance to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance, Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica, or shortly MUD (about the round table of the Democratic Unity), in which opposition parties and political groups joined forces, was to take part in the proceedings against President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. "in addition, a 12-hour strike on the following day as well as a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, was to continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationwide Civil War and on November 3 all go to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="171">The images of the marches published in real time testify, among other things, an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country, but also confrontations with policemen as well as supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">"" "one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstrator calling through the shields:" "" "will you kill me because I am hungry?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images that talk about disputes, as well as reports of oppression and abuse, are piling up on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators moved back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own testimony before the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean State TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira do not wear skirts, otherwise you can see something that many national gardists do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic is already making the round, representing the amount of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an impeachment procedure - this has been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="186">NicolÃ¡s and Diosdado claim that 1% of signatures are falsified.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your removal!</seg>

<seg id="189">Others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which, from their point of view, has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches are increasing in frequency and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="192">Some Venezuelans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike, rather than to work or to go shopping.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, published on 23 August 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean town of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano now testifies to his father as part of the great La Perla-Ribera in the province of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not realize that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not see that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto was not a choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department 141 at La Perla.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">Everyone named him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have made friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass just that they will not take you one day and I will have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, the Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Argentinian revolutionary workers "party.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to crush papers that had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all sorts of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barrack in which cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were removed and stopped me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted into an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I spied in, and saw a couch that was tortured upon men.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fixed the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanisation.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order came from above that they should be laid.</seg>

<seg id="346">Edited the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In Kyoto's Japanese city, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driving licences have witnessed a very unsuccessful translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a shield, the Japanese word, which means "older motorists," was mistaken - perhaps even with malicious thoughts & # 8212; translated as "awful motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was available from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was to the translator Julian Holmes, a citizen Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-issuing daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could such an English translation be?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult for elderly people and simply unacceptable in an international city like Kyoto," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">"" "the wrong English translation was first removed. the term" "" "terrible drivers" "" "was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit not completely correct term" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of Kyoto Prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that older people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News made a little more detailed with the phenomenon of "fearsome" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the share of older motorists who are involved in accidents across the country is certainly a cause of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this equates to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">As a result, their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and to transfer active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be in the original language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers wishing to learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees can still make translations in-house. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The perverted and enigmatic phrases that arise from machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true in some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulas in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more accurate translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the "Navegar con Libertad" portal (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also survived recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups who oppose the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests started in early April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was captioned and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites are banned again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ vivoplaylist web page.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission on Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">I have subscribed to @ vivoplaynet with no cable TV and informative national TV channels.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that it is cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinFiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly delegates their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique that the DNS servers answer requests for certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server responds incorrectly or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third blocked channel, was discontinued on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera operator Elvis Flores, who was transferred to the protests in Caracas, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV was on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans access to multimedia reporting on current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report by Curative, published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools"), edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from university, she once again returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become of something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never was treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began working as a Criadita for the family. in Paraguay there are more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children will have to pay for countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract you cannot lift.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criadilla - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated against Criadite guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they should complete their education, improve their position in society, and "make something out of themselves" can be transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not receive education, and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon occuring in secrecy in Paraguayan households was seen, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to the hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of violent beatings.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military officer TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital of AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira moved with a stick to MarÃ­n until she suffered a fatal injury.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela headed the practice of Criadazgo, rooted deep in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered than children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a quick investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case is in court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be trend-setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguays a case of Criadazgo came to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as labor force, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to sign in bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as a Criadita to the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">In her employer's house Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner it was finished with learning, the more free time it had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve but also did not receive unlimited food. "I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathisers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings, the master Alvarenga forced Alvarenga to stand next to him and read editorial articles such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"the landlord had found someone who listened while talking about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they felt I would" "" "learn" "" "bad habits again." "" "they thought that Alvarenga, belonging to the indigenous group of GuaranÃ­, would once again speak their mother tongue GuaranÃ­." ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Her Lord feared that she would lose the education she gave her, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">"" "also at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against." "" "one thing about which almost never is spoken is bullying and the harassment that Criaditas are exposed when they go to school." ""</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I could not invite anybody to go home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I was not part of a group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users would have to register with their correct names and identity card numbers on the website, in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could result in a penalty of up to six months' imprisonment or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The draft legislation consisting of six paragraphs and circulated in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs and is used across the Internet to communicate with others by voice, video-based and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration. unclear is also how they should make up for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation at the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeast Japan, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi prefecture. the Prefecture of Miyagi was an unusual prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighbouring settlements Fukushima and Iwate were forcibly evacuated, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture has yet to have a nuclear accident, even so, alone, 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows from the local point of view what progress was achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper comprises statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare-houses (in-the-world, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi had the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned spare houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, six years after the catastrophe, one still tries to relocate the evacuated of temporary shelters (assays, casetsu juutaku) to final substitute buildings.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate still lived in such shelters.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the people evacuated from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuations, which were hauled after disaster in shelters, were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung was able to determine, 1074 of 1,100 schools, which were affected by the disaster, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 per cent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are back in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident have affected extensively in the three prefectures agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 per cent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima lie in the "nuclear blackout zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can have here only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next great earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. she asked her about the state of reconstruction and how her feeling has changed vis-Ã -vis the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed found that still not enough was done in disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also intensified its attention to the situation of the evacuated people from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the mighty earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to witness.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 thousand people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 some 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand, still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuated people, who still live in shelters, are older than 50 years old. they are well known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When you meet people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we treat topics that in reporting often get less attention than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how a hike conquered her affection for Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa reminisces about the time she worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33, this week was delivered to the intensive care unit: last Friday, a police officer had struck him against his head during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia. across the country, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Physicians operated on this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">The picture shows the face of the police officer who attacked with a shoal. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s noted that Sampaio was suspended until the investigation of the incident by the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer, how he strikes in GoiÃ¢nia with his striking stick on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer would be beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be seen for six months on television and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">"" "the Facebook page" "" "Desneuralizador" "", "a media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, divided the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net in which you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics rush to him shortly afterwards." ""</seg>

<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the Mateus family living in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian relays (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in GoiÃ¢nia while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="612">On Facebook, Professor Pablo Ortellado calls for further violence against activists in GoiÃ¡s:</seg>
<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s experiences a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was killed by his father because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. and now we have sabotaged a occupied school with a gas leak. and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who has been attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a punch.</seg>
<seg id="614">Police attacks</seg>
<seg id="615">GoiÃ¡s was not the only country in Brazil where it came to brutal police deployments last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Policemen sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a stage for speakers, rubber floors and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media have covered street protests by directing the focus to another, unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustratively design their title pages with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a set-up bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">You also have to acknowledge this if you are strictly against any form of property damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" gets an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violence of the military police is covered by headlines with the title "demonstrators on confrontation course with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">The Lost Villages in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular community of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabees, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mills, despite the fact that there are no significant sugar crops on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After succeeding, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are still in operation after a long period of inactive time, because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls to have heard that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they became intolerable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left the factories only to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of 98 sugar cane factories came, more than 65 million people received their full wages for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats is" "" "scam" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be obtained, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It dealt with officially authored documents, which were distinguished only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addsat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everyone was signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister was able to approve every decision.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was transferred and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>

<seg id="690">A song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do so using Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song writing, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop goes on with the fact that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance," or whatever they do in mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called Highway of tears, a stretch of road in West-kanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always speak the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whaplean oostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to keep my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go ahead with our youth as well</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they have intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comments section, the reader and supporters of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also contribute and add the verse in syllabus (which is also published on his blog and is republished here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance to the shokuhin sanpuru (which is to be seen, "Plastic models of the dishes") are issued by any food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see themselves in these plastic courts and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend turns it into conspicuous cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic courts decorated mobile tapes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supply is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We have also made this part for the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that keeps your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and cell phones allow you to create your own work of art. in this case ikura or salmon cheating is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">Is there anyone who would say: "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell with salmon rogues?"</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courses can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further quirky plastic courts can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #, which is to be held.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi neighborhood, which is devoted to supplying the restaurant industry, for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and interrogaged persons appear on a regular basis only in statistics, but they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle brings with them.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reporting of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely suppressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the communities that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">That is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "live with drug trafficking"), which will give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were in the fight between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities therefore have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how afraid life changes" "" ") tells exactly those stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches out secret tombs for his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on one single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priest:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have asked ourselves to go and look for tombs, according to the people whom we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="771">You are entitled to my father's insurance, but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where are we going to get them?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">We must not only show the faces of those who fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state leadership.</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories from readers and reports from journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known illness and sensationalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass the newspaper kiosks every day and see the pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or look at this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness, when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "soiled." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four-month blackmail in the main city district: how a family has been plundered with threats." it describes how armed criminals have blackmailed money from their business month by month until they end up not only destroying the business, but also torn down their families.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, as you do not know when they will deceive or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days, whether crying would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation-drawn generation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he says that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks from his home, saw the bloody body of his father, shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez was like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence by organised crime and the fight against it mingled with the existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of murders according to the Government of Public Safety and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor's Office counted 3103 killings.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="817">"sharing is Caring" from flickr user Niklas WikstrÃ¶m (CC-BY-NC 2.0) WARNING: this post and pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented.</seg>
<seg id="818">The fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication, it has been misguided to use tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to death.</seg>
<seg id="828">Officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a cinema nearby, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and stolen corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were not knowledgeable.</seg>
<seg id="831">"" "a picture titled" "" "Das ist Nigeria" "". "from Imgur-User Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of the day." ""</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of corded bodies lying on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities that they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and shrubs.</seg>
<seg id="840">Reports have been reported, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said a Residents to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The cause for the attack was also unclear, but the military service point in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of miscarriages; Africa Check has documented arrangements for Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further, personal comments such as this example falsely link the picture from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a Blitzkrieg, published by the United Nations, those who flee could flee blows, rape and many dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news site, which in 2012 mistakenly claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein was said to have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="859">The worldwide range of false information</seg>

<seg id="861">"" "using an" "" "reverse image search" "" "you can see how far information can cross borders." ""</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted image search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures under 18.8 billion images (as of May 3, 2017), which are very similar to the said image from DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed masch of private sites, platforms of social media and community, as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the assassinations of Christians by Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underestimated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot believe these images any longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently take part in drinking the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of misinformation and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and in Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (here, for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images desensitise readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot of discussion about violent representations in the news media, fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used by the context or in a totally misused way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog named untranslatable (e.g. unsurpassable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unsurpassable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremara).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone obstinately resists every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example Vanuatu's words from Vanuatu are found in the blog, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Take care of your parents in recognition of how they care about you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after you have been warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defy other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page still want to publish more of these "invaliable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="972">After an opinion of the disaster headquarters of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were missed because of floods and muddy swamps.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls ceased on Saturday (27th May), and the water levels in some areas were slowly declining.</seg>

<seg id="981">The air force has provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are made to transport emergency supplies for the inhabitants trapped in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organisations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They discouraged me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't look alike all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narratives fail to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi-Arab, Muslim women by their government are forced to cover their entire body, these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1121">There is another group that has grown exponentially by creating the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1122">A few years earlier, it had not yet given them; now they have mastered large areas in Syria and Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="1123">I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter, but who today made me an irresponsible Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Things I have left here like a breadcrumb line in my speech.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Things that may evoke memories, for in all the intersections that our humanity constitutes, a story may lie where someone is made to "another."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Right now, on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley, conversations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islamophobia.</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx talk 2017 in Stanford, where but Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are led and people are being enthroned by creating the "other" in public perception four decades ago was even a scientist of Stanford himself.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions, as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March because the occupation that we did not have a president who bombarded chocolate cake while he already bombed countries and "to other" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the unsurpassable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been running events since 2015, is the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world's languages can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to it often is connected to understanding," "" "these events are instead" "" "listening to" "" "to appreciate, to feel, to touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, historical narrators first introduce their history in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even though the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and representation are leading to the fact that the audience is attuned to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call forth laughter and emotion, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language daeming. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the tale of Rabbit and the Pavian in Shona language from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his fabel, John Nyamara is asked:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a broad grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all those inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling performances.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civic organizations took part in a mass demonstration last April 3, 2017; the march started with the Puertorios Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the Old Town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la deuda" (civic front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical church assembly of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of fixing debt have also filed a petition on the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"" "" "" "the people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debt are responsible for their corruption." ""</seg>

<seg id="1161">We are blackmailing and suppressed.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian Webdeveloper Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture organised in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director at Book Sprints, a publishing house published by so-called 'Book Sprints' published books within three to five days, read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available royalty-free, contains a number of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what are the real costs associated with.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartoum, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has many of us begin to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporarily extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel had taken part in a" strictly secret "command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015, they were contacted by persons who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and conditions remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Former, a designer, technologist, and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes was more prescient than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recreate the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilisations and here, Greek-Roman architectural styles fuse with local traditions and Persian influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know at that time that ten years after he began his work, the IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet completed this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I'm overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually keeping one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prosabuch that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="1247">Basle's story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) has vanished more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime of force were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in prison since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has called for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we reiterate our demand in the hope that we have to do this last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: due to corruption condemned director after release again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambians responded with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned after half of his sentence to work in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">Theodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 together with four other defendants.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mozambique's airports, whose advice was taken by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his reinstatement to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement issued by the Attorney General of the Republic, who submitted the application, there would be no reason for Cambaza to re-establish his old post, as the company did not carry out any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action is good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to revive the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should have introduced disciplinary measures against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent and did not cause appropriate legal action for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, an important voice in the social media, rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep paying talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Repulsive!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambian and student of political science in Brazil says that the director is no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks the morals to return and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the State, but instead only served himself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself had become tired of this man who was charged and eventually sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºt prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind him that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to Samora Machel prison. Mosambians will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as sharp, overlapping and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he vigorously affirmed that "an ambitious man should be able to sell the fatherland for his ambition, his own individual interest."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. he changes tactics, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious man is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter, the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison. he was 10 years old and released.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censuses many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means chickpeas or splits." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the web because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although it is still being discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word have been censored in order to express their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written in Burmesan 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting blower), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalkulaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookicker Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because it contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The sentence ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to Facebook's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before all posts are extinguished, which would be suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitting bsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who disseminate hate speech get a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to anyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of catchwords is often a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to erase his posts, when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to let my Facebook friends know that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"" "ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from reading, posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post" "" "did not meet the Facebook Community standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a multiplicity of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speeches of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems as if they started doing this without local context or technical support and banned words such as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now laugh at Facebook and do not consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch a Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to check if Facebook removes the post containing the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says," "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalistic ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also encourage violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine region, where there were thousands of disputes between Muslims and Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the outgrowing hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better, more in context than on code concentration initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">In May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere since that, age did not determine the maturity. "</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children who were already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements aimed at abolishing the laws of infancy followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">However, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms to tell the critics of the children's marriage, they should, condemning themselves for their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition led to tensions in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambharat: the Bill against Child Labour was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it and not one single one voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary-General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's most famous Hindu organisation.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take legal action, should the law be adopted, and he seems to dissolve his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the General Attorney General Paris Al Rawi, an advocate of the law, said it was quite lawful for Maharaj to act against the law, most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather than speaking of the problem that we invite the state into our bedroom, instead of talking about the fact that the state, our daughters, protects them that they may be abused by large, hard-boiled men who are opposed to them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the infancy in various gradations is legal or still the norm, although there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular cyclopaedia Wikipedia which is based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series resist blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech savvy Internet users are used to using circumscribing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN-prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia recently, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet law (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculators), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports on its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (via Wikipedia), we do everything to put snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. this is the way to read the content in a distributed and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was conducted independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a MirrorSite of Wikipedia, as well as Wikipediror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrors if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL, which is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server continues the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring the animal world to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him with his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just came home when suddenly I called Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately started to gnash pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know, for he stood facing tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the book seemed to appear. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he gazes at me through the scarf trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">"" "to promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo" "" "I click for conservation" "" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos." ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and spent most of the time in a tent to take photographs of Ottern at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could take a picture of a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been republished as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are avoiding the utmost care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of the social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto from the Indian state of Odisha was convicted by a false court and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relative with a name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear, if at all which, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune area, in Maharashtra, nine women including health personnel and housewives, a unique club, became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # Khelbaal campaign, which is operated by the Video Volunteers community and campaigned for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas worked for seven years with the help of her video camera to expose practices, such as children's marriage, to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected individuals, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion round dealt with women who did not call her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open a discussion about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to say aloud the names of their husbands, is a custom they all maintain and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is regarded as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try at home at home as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to initiate discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked everyone," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us what they want, does it mean that they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they had the name of their husbands over their lips," "" "says Rohini Pahas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women never pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she only giggled in front of herself during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole blissful frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush about having broken with an old custom, the women decided that they would actually attempt to call their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the carcinogenic point on the forehead that indicates marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "I said to my husband that I would wear the" "" "halluberred" "" "point if he would do it too." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped altogether, but think they are now in a better position to choose to not wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discus club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discus club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months, for the first time in their life, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I've never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only carried out saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them it's okay, but some wanted to wear a Salwar-Kurta, a wide shirt across a pant, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of his own dress selection, the morals coupled with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to take a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the question whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed something, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continues to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discus club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a patriarchy's sacrifice.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it's not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, probably for waning purposes, worries the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found beheaded and a part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the bodies of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is local superstition that the head of a man of bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth, declared the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia der BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight against these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Ukombe Weya lives in the city of Maputo.</seg>
<seg id="1595">He warned those who are going to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Attention to kahle men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks, the Mosambian police warned about the latest assassinations of three men of bald due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husbitten Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inspectrae in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of men of bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mordecai, province of ZambÃ©zia, for presumably abergistic rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power, generating wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of Bloggers's poor Snaippa, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty in which Mozambique faces:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃCHTE GERMANY BEING WITHOUT A country where people would have shame to go to the streets, dressed as if they would be ashamed of taking sex against good marks, work and other services, a nation in which people would revert honest workers or even take their lives to gain their bread, a land in which neither the albinos nor bald or bald men will be hunted for abusing purposes or "black magic."</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some missed the opportunity for macabre humor.</seg>
<seg id="1605">Zenaida Machado, the scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique, and enthusiastic Twitter users, tweetete that both head of the district Moravibala, Pedro Sange and the police spokesman ZambÃ©zias, InÃ¡cio Dina, are both bald-faced:</seg>

<seg id="1612">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria, active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel Khartabil (also known as Bassel Safadi) played a key role in expanding the public's access to the Internet and Open Knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="1613">He was a close friend of many of the Global Voices community and participated in our meeting of Arab bloggers in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="1614">In November 2015, Basle's wife Noura Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons who spent themselves as insiders of the Assad government.</seg>
<seg id="1615">They reported that their husband had been sentenced to death but did not give any further information.</seg>
<seg id="1616">Basle's stay and constitution were unknown until today (01 August 2017) when Noura of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1617">Today and in the future, Bassel's work as a pioneer of the open web movement will be the honor.</seg>
<seg id="1618">And we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations who have been campaigning for their release over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared, such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Countless of those arrested or forcibly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even executions.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Between 2011 and 2016 no less than 17,723 Syrians have died in custody, the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced late June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "Subversion" (state threat) after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and told a spokesman that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China still receives calls from the international community to release Nobel Prize laureate and his wife, poetess Liu Xia, or permit him to have treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summed up some foreign reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations united nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure in order to allow Liu abroad to be treated.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway, Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, despite the fact that the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the import of salmon to China since exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to fetch his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately free Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also urged China to release Lius as she announced in a statement on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to elevate all restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US embassy asked for a furious response from China, with the utterance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley said that China should offer the couple:</seg>

<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have just launched a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government forward to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Peking of the news agency Reuters reported that China had great concerns whether the whirlwind of Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to talk and get in touch.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to say:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and freedom of action for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France, France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a declaration on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information on whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Hong Kong</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of landings in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who employ peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu Mei-nu, of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also urged China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very worried in a statement on 28 June around Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable land, one can say that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a duty of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very classy: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal" countries, given that he appeared inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">It has, on the other hand, defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, as well as cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre emerges from authoritarian rulers, who pretended to be democrats, abandoned the twisted logic, because it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the last week Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system, really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He warned the corresponding questions with non-responses of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to clear his mind as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to elucidate this point as long as he was paid highly to be part of the Government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing its commentary on the blog, Anon points out that it should begin to read the complete transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">When he said that Singapore was not a country, he obviously did not mean it in this sense!</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Justice Minister of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard that I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that is correct and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shanmugam made a mistake" "" "a mistake" "", "or was it a Freudian orator?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, are we only seen as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore going back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Cabinet's cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of grave importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapur make their military service, do they defend only their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human identity card?</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parody the Junta, which in 2014 has seized power and, despite its promises to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of what rules his girlfriend does.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded to Facebook has been shared 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief an absolute discretion on important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other reviewers of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit in the army was also set up to monitor the online content and prosecute persons accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">"" "Thailand fights against" "" "Lese Majeste" "" "(Majestic insult)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, there was a coup d "Ã©tat of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta still pursues is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van, before putting them into an internment warehouse, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">"" "some journalists are in jail because they allegedly caused" "" "confusion" "" "in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison terms, they should offend the monarchy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1805">It has been over 20 years since the Georgian-Abchassic war officially ended, but its scars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The abandoned villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharshava are located in the Coal Basin of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, Asia Minor, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, mostly Russians and rabbits live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period there were still more than 10,000 people, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district amounted to 16,000 people, after having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillenframe and gold-colored ear rings in teddy bears.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - despite this, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells, the people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings her to hospital if they are ill, she buys them drugs that they cannot pay, she massages them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is common for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>

<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the track and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp of Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachular.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family visited migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has started helping them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>

<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachular are coming from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez told me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachee he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Afrika, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the traveler quietly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez is happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandma she smoothes in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair-weeds that she has made a lady, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi received a phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"" "" "" "however, the authorities could also use the app for more than the fight against terrorism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was able to identify and prosecute sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main feature is blocking pornographic websites, from online scams, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports on digital censorship in China mainly focus on users' experiences in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often dark for those living in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often submit extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China," published in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notice required the people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you may be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are meant for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "", "in addition, published a Jingwang product description, indicating that the software can lift up the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobiles in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the spread of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office when they operate their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">An up-to-date report by Freedom House, a US human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to let all residents and entrepreneurs register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian rapper Emballam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emballam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emballam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slings to his screen, sometimes to his computer, sometimes to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the upper floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs's family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felayees (e.g. Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks her old-tried opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rape music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his home town of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and according to his own statement, he can sympathize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he is jealous of American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees of the second generation" - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "emphasizes Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a man," "" "while in water NescafÃ© poured into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot juncture has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the chimes of lukewarm coffee and the wavering of the Kent cigar in the nose speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan drink - not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the interior ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some members of Parliament supporting the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontal singer Hamed Sinno contradicted the cultural and traditional norms of the country and was the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MEPs and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled due to the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that question the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporters of human rights" "" "who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not simply be plain rhetoric, but in fact reflect an increasingly clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib resided traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have been marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently bent unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of "honorable massacres" has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outwardness.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honours reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 crime against crime, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be kept in jail for an indefinite period," and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the family's guarantee that the woman will not be able to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from subjects that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and speech.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been told," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">"" "in a song called" "" "Edward sat'ed" "", "Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song one verse is repeated conspicuously often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Yordan online program Roya, in order to notice later that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and his opinion were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib openly advertises the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwa, a poet of the eighth century, still alive thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwa, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph later, was able to write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can't Jordan do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitic realm, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the teacher's association with the reason that they have critically criticised the problems linked to the corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - is made up of slow, thoughtful and internal changes.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He is not only dreaming of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached by music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, cluster munitions and artificially created democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many regions of Tohokus. another theory states that the floats, drums and dancing were passed over more than a thousand years and came from a time when armies from West Japan were marching to the north east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gayoen, organized a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro-Gayoen for a long time: two cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely external appearances and personal hygiene were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser's.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robberies and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the Friseure's competition "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressers and instead of bad advice to obtain training in hairdressing art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported on some of their achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district, where we are very proud, because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters," published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel kicked out to accommodate affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Precisely this question left the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Carta por la GesliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signatory of the agreement of peace was considered so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, before the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal detention for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried their weapons round the clock, must now be integrated into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now enter their ranks and support them in setting up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters in order to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each one of the former guerrilla fighters, who are to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letter to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogota in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk to Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who desperately need them.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed most of the most urgently.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan arose to write letters full of hope and support to former fighters of the FARC who now find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manicales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on March 19th.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotÃ¡ arrived in the camp to deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set up as they had done earlier in order to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political scientist Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former soldier led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of refuge where guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL shear launcher, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Palace.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war, he was tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far, I have only learned how to handle weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices against new voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the FARC leaders declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State impacted the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves into a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often had seen as monsters and even hated, were people with beautiful feelings turned around by their circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and have done so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians had been prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now relying on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the foundation of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I took her without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message: "then there are no more men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents through WhatsApp did the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was reading a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying, "Here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around I felt something in my body, but I did not hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still dishonour the family, you wreck?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and eventually woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently, some women had everything to be heard and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two bite wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which ambulances have you been laid - in those of the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my manly name stands on it, but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running through the streets above; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was just bad talk, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mom on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only corrupted your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, a car was standing under the window with dark windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was a bit rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to disclose their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"" "" "" "I bought them without registering, without knowing anything." ""</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're in security just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know what hotel you are in. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender balance, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When chatting with camera, I actually bother to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For me, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had spent one and a half months in Irgun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all of them could scarcely wait for the end of Ramadan and he did not exclude a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end require proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine said there weren't very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrow's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or have you got a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm just quoting someone who was in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave themselves?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think I was already known in Grosny before 2003, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously in earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to lead us to" "" "civilisation" "", "but finally brought us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Defense of Sharia never spared me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the language of Chechnya there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long before Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">He who had smiled and laughed before, gazed at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic continuously worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activities are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">"" "" "" "I discovered these people myself when I clapped refuge." ""</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to white with foam before the mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have whom, the Cabardines have, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet, there are them - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims entering the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about the number of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be precise, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all for that - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months, there has been a strong rise in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 withdrew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video made on YouTube held the moments when he lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could no longer do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month a few others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have offended.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: it was all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is based in the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy seized power and had great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable crops for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population gets little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, famine and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime is refusing to systematically ban the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams, redirecting water from the Arab territories to the Persian lands, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are diverted.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk adolescents now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job will finish the primary school, 55% completed a secondary school, and 45% have university degrees.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist, resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions prefer not to hire Arab workers, access to employment opportunities in all sectors is deprived of the local Arab Ahwazi.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their home, Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first name and last name in order to hide their affiliation with the Ahwazi, as even Arab names wouldn't be tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists are alarmed before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CCTV Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions came to expression.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women - who refer to themselves as intersectional feminists - are frustrated.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even place well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminists in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still make sure women meet a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still going through the many different countries and denominations.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer doubly and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to talk on skin color, racism, black cis women, black women in the LGBTI community or black women from the Diaspora; when I mention what kind we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to "lift up their voices and" sing Kumbaya, my Lord, "in order to reach equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to mention that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalised form of racist-motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above all, black women and women from other ethnic and countries of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement as a black woman who refuses to consider injustices in their thinking, which relate to the sex and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, sojourner complained in their speech:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I too refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman in a historical sense is a demented and marginalised being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural assimilation in order to drive forward their egocentric agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to instruct them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism that has been established for my dark skin and my status as a woman instead of using myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of Africana womanism: reclaiming tales (about: Africa-Womanism: how we recapture ourselves) speaks of the fact that we can defend ourselves by defining our own way. and not only that - black women can create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and where the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life neither bypassed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector told Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-wife, who had become violent against her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Some time had passed since the end of her relationship and the police said that her statement would be put into action, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman Balbuena showed abuses for ill-treatment, the acute indication of Ada BÃ¡ez also availed nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women make an advert at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must report at all to the prosecution authorities.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is difficult to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are different information and reports that do not even point to the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the available numbers are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney General launched 9600 ads because of domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 displays due to domestic violence among the peace courts. also here, 86% of women's advertisements came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women claimed that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"" "according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "" "on every woman who is reimbursed in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so." ""</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "at the end of 2014, two women who do not do this," "" "she stated at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide is not a criminal offence in Paraguay, the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and legal system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want that, but then she gave up. this should always regret her.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she inherited the psychological violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would ever become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the mistreatment by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had failed so long ago and did not leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay in order to prove that her former partner was mistreating her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" "" "I believe you" "" ") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case, everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements in the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a process against her former partner, who developed into an impermeable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was debated in the Paraguayan parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # Porelas (# fÃ¼rst).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# NonEineWeniger) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to explain and punish feminid on an independent crime, as is the case already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislative text was modified in some points to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay, can be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">"" "" "" "the original bill envisaged that most of the (bureaucratic and economic) costs which the victims of violence must wear themselves if they simply restitution and want to receive a secure property to impose the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echeffri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for this:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethinking has to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who is silent in the face of these facts, is complicit and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators get away punished.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we need to refund such a long ad until ill treatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, sections of the law had been altered. among other things, a passage was canceled, which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes are going apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The submission of the words "gender," "political violence" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is considered a great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Afghan authorities closed the independent Arab-speaking newspaper Azamn for their reporting of corruption in the sultante.</seg>

<seg id="2552">The rule of the sultan is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, especially the secret services, the freedom of the public, including freedom of the press, interference and torture of human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is seldom or even not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the offer of the global healthcare system that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists themselves helps build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier talked about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the Serbian national programme for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain the recipients instead of being a creator himself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">Q: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, space research, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outstanding Gorgeous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only applied to individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, special red or green tones or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the last few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartons. due to this trend plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds Salad, but he now needs longer because his work is more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a rock is lying in a river to which I have to paddle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do this right now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far to Salate." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of lettuce because all the features are already patented. "so he continues as good as possible and tries to identify those features he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strives to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" "" "breeding)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salat of the Outstanding Gorgeous in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (open source seed initiative) is inspired by the movement for free open source software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to the fact that others can freely use the seed bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others to breed their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not to use it immediately - two aspects which are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, he says and takes on the increasingly frequent mergers in the global agriculture industry, the latest examples are the merges of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which are being offered for example on farmers markets, should also know that the way in which this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that their seeds remain freely available to others, as opposed to patenting seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is always limited.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all antiques attributes are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to use either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown plants such as wheat are in even greater style patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Viewing</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour improves to such as they thrive in certain environments and can withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is declining more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the altered conditions due to climate change are much worse than ever.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving the genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "it contradicts, however, that intellectual property protects other breeders as" "" "promoting patents and protecting plant varieties" "". "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not hinder innovations, it also promotes them by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: waiting for a patent for 20 years, certainly does not foster innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow crops that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "but the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton is disturbed by the concept of patenting plant traits: "we don't really create the traits ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds its own values.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation of mass herbicides, breeding into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly contrary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents, they manage most smaller seed companies to survive even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that Breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks as if I was with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still locked up content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information abiding in spite of this attack and the ridicule of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who are actually defending the law to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, for example the independent news site Mada Masr, the Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network originating from Qatar for alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human Rights Organization of the wave of website locks has fallen victim to. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to FEHRI, the blog of the columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no longer able to access Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for non-accessible websites and media for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he established to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Canada blog is given a home, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting on the student protests and taking a video, as the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government and reflected what it means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has a priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although the blot of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, blocking blogs, and any other web site for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities locked 133 pages from May 24th to August 6th. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In addition, afte documented the blocking of providers by circumventing InterNet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice suggests the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that might have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed against these actions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are arguing.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers are reporting in all Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old is shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro" is murdered, "" Thieves rob pharmacy with military weapons, "" President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army, Marine and Air Wafee to Rio. "</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and a tense financial situation, the threshold of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which it announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city will now be published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that are happening in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what only happens in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision is not a cause for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubric in a country that doesn't recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist from the newspaper explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security there are 843 sites in Rio de Janeiro, which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions to cover up.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argues against denouncing violence as a "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for those in charge of the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of the military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the Mordrates per federal state, Rio is ranked 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">In addition, Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as CecÃ­lia emphasizes, has been repeating the state security policy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the Federal State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police depot and permanently stationing one unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">For several years, however, according to several reports of shkanen and repressions against the poor communities that the newly created police unit should actually protect, the UPP is increasingly under attack.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux translated from one of his articles in 2010 explaining why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio will also result in serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This demands the state to use means and ways typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week ago, the police passed the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit seller died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer under brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib are currently around a million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians, is particularly affected.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume, on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these areas, controlled by rebels, have been under siege from Damascus, causing residents to rely on locally produced or tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unachievable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"" "as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as" "" "food-saving food source." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many district capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the North of Portugal this week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 injured in the wake of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government's last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in Galicia, Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, a similar tragedy occured, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the district Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is only in 4 districts no fire.</seg>

<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Sovereigl of the Federation of Farmers of Portugal stated the paper PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2851">Furthermore, building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objectionable by the local authorities, who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus drew attention to the fact that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily flammable wood, as in a vicious circle, spread ever further after fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems include that the website of the Civil Defence Act of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, when inhabitants searched for information or attempted to contact their relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial on this fateful weekend in October that the server did not resist the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2875">At that time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara, sat in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family during dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say that at that time, she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy was supposed to break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf was again in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little reward and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, Afghan refugees in Iran were marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in a deserted building on the construction site, on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows, so that we don't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf had left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">At the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks, and went to a church that gave food to aid people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high twin rates. it is true, however, that the conditions to find asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation" "" "Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes," "" "the system suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can be withdrawn for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible way of life helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years some Afghans have created businesses, among them dressmaking, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Peace & amp restaurant in Padua; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashark's aims extend far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim to return to the country that he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and manufacturing techniques. "this way they can sell their harvest surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans in this way.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Citizen report: draft law drafts from Egypt allow the shutdown of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the camp of Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the suspension of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo of @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Neural Report is an international snapshot showing challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that shows that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after a registration with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use social networks within six months of the successful statute on the authority's website, stating their full name and identity number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months "imprisonment or the settlement of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which has been applied by 60 members of parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another MP filed a legislative proposal introducing harder penalties for the insult of the president or a high official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, such action would, however, be punished with prison and fines, such as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the condemned.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "moreover, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who were demonstrating against the military coup led by the elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 protesters, who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison for a judgment date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his hearing was postponed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the defendants from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan has threatened the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, the apparent burden of, among other things, the possession of weapons, illegal assemblage, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza answered the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their reporting to the pro-Morsi blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previous case, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogated Tunisian activists with sighted documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated to a sighted action plan. said plan is provided by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill that would warrant officers amnesty to the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2949">This document, published on April 21, on the Nawaat website, sheds light on how the President's plans look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the nomination of his sources, stating that Article 11 of the Tunisian press code assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he witnessed the case in the district court in Tunis on 09th May.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to submit their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the state council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require approval before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the rules, it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts predict that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments into conversations within social networks. it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to only selectively enforce these rules in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May the state censorship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomanzor, WeChat failed to register as the" "" "organiser of the distribution of information" "" "in the state government." ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a 2014 law, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services for removing content and compiling it upon request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoisseniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has block Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court decreed the Wikipedias locking in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the indications that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication admitted that the site had been blocked because it became "a source of information that collaborates with groups in order to impose a political defamation campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries worldwide where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Britain may not stop snooping around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor, decrypting data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telcos and intelligence services concerning the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation is still ongoing until May 19. reactions and proposals from members of the public may be forwarded to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.</seg>
