this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA heard illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed over dra@@ fts to Iran for an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has determined against Ris@@ en and urged him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous that they give .
so when the government le@@ aped in Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave Re@@ porter did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
all of a sudden , although they say for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped on Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failure and ris@@ ings to make statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly obtained his telephone bill ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit meeting , and even travel tips with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary convic@@ ted more than all U.S. governments .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional commitment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
they can do so from the moment they get in touch , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet been published when Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ mitting system for whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation at which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer obtain information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole , in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spi@@ onage technologies that end@@ anger us all .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have the chance to bring out mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the nearest environ@@ ment@@ alists who alarm the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect all of our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the biggest data publisher of the history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Pap@@ ers reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; huge sums of money &#93; have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were informed of news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , via a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now this sounds like the plot of an agency ri@@ ller or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this happen to us ?
but the truth is that when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that applies to all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are being used by some few to hide and veil their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these gi@@ ants .
it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters .
I find it also interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the United States .
probably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who came up with this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but thanks to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples of connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states , less information is needed to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has permitted che@@ aters to rip off particularly vulnerable str@@ uts .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were really shocked by the fact that everyone up to one lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as isolated cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to do this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound suspi@@ ci@@ ously as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen proposals for more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been registered in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is la@@ gging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advocate this kind of transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made a sale of the farm .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me enthusias@@ tically how he wanted to change the world .
it became late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh , man ! what did I get in there ?
a stranger is sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is mad ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sli@@ pping on toes to the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewpoint .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something for it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and breakfast each morning .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we left our last guest and the door fell into the lock , Brian and I star@@ ed at us .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came in rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ aching czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website that people publicly share images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms - the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to det@@ on@@ ate .
but they do not .
no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ed would invest in a business which permits foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on things you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your mobile phone to your left neighbour .
this quiet approach of panic that you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read their SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who is actually Al G@@ ores cell phone now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is can@@ adi@@ ed for the President &apos;s office ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name ? if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 ratings , all say : &quot; he can really stick to very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed over their assessments before we presented them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust people most of all who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation ev@@ okes common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you spend on yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimum degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great art@@ works in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which issues you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been met before .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when trust was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than those calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays were only a fraction of a problem .
for men trust one another .
if trust works , there can be a wonderful thing .
one of our guests was on holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books .
they let one stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not do justice to the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people place a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in every place one visits , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub bar that you have never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would shape apartments from the ground up to the other ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would assume the thought of sharing a common part ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in Seoul &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun .
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a residence ,
were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programs were launched ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even a host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why has it just worked ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or just a delay when check back at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies show that the Americans think most people don &apos;t know Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ul@@ ator fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ st myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I chose the Hi@@ j@@ ab to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Quran .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ m@@ ics sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves you ?
it feels like this .
later I got married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast in the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should we do this ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern par@@ ent@@ age ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; bombs Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others turned me into a susp@@ ects .
the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I ro@@ de -- when we ro@@ de -- so deep into my seat , and I was the first time feared to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not am@@ a@@ ze yourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in@@ doors all week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were lou@@ der : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims to free and beat .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have rep@@ elled the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was fur@@ ious too .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the US .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
it might stop a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop terror .
regular visits to a mos@@ que lead to a more tolerant outlook on people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
when first the person is cut off from their congregation , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we have to stop people go to the mos@@ que .
some still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology mainly on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they allow these things to be read into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said that the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts , who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and His church .
instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways of a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen .
we are more likely to accept author@@ itarian governance , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that if people report messages that have a negative impact on Muslims , they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
when you look at when the mood of Muslims pushed upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in the context of terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
in the assignment of collective guilt it is not only about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented in the dental department , talented , promising a lot ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , the most generous person whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we ro@@ de sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , drew my shoes , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw was stopped .
the hall was completely full .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : well , D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any way .
if people like an exception tend to appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before air pack@@ et delivery came into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flight units , they reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
they can also build self @-@ reli@@ ant structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with turbul@@ ences and generally react to nature laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to transc@@ end the limits of possible within the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands can be found on the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called hed@@ geho@@ g ,
a flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ fish , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a flip side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight machine no matter what position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . that &apos;s okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote controlled plane . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical simple , very much happens in the inner life so that it can fly stable , and can move anywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right properly .
the probability of just throwing it right , if all of you watch me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its orientation .
in this way , it receives the ability to have the full capacity ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is turned or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are represent@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let us look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they have to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller drops , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , though limited .
we will demonstrate this now by fli@@ ght@@ less half of the aircraft .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying shade of lamps on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy ; they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy .
they ligh@@ tened this short moment bri@@ ghter than all the stars along in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole world known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was created on Earth .
since then the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves that are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved detection performance .
therefore it is now called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the Det@@ ector was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes occupied through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector itself .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the departure from my to@@ d@@ sick father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been investigating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their through observ@@ atories like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a wave of gravity is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other .
for illustr@@ ative teachers in courses on rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a really alpine dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched during the arrival of the waves . the stretching of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . hence , one explained the Lig@@ o @-@ staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . that &apos;s grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength far smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , as you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
sounds are different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
the face of your child for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is just Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob breaks her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies lie in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has worked very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . this sounds like wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; No one who knows what to listen to knows this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ times solar mass , which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s briefly consider what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est bodies in space , one with a mass of 29 uns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times a second before colli@@ ding .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as never before .
on this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible .
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practical or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I &apos;d like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe from them .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the core , hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these are opa@@ que .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own night @-@ light .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and that is most important : I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea .
in fact , in the first run , Lig@@ o found things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , such as lig@@ o it ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes , so to speak , are the sau@@ erk@@ no@@ ons for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of what is happening in space , the emergence of the stars , and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories , a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago , I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
do I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
do I want to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , eliminated my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social fear -- ph@@ ew , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the least , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak @-@ cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I &apos;ve been swa@@ yed to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think of things , aw@@ aken you to life .
dream job .
no , no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each stream offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four times four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV shows run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself , and not just produced , so on top of that . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that are burning around the world .
do you know who still does it ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , a store or a household , take me seriously if I talk about work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just around the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dream job with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened into my work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as if I painted on a canvas .
like a high sound , you run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , ar@@ du@@ ous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best part is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz@@ ing begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go on her forever .
many people assume that when I explain to them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sums -- when I began to work and work and to make , create , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a hum@@ ming , then you can &apos;t asp@@ ire to size .
the feeling of being unable to asp@@ ire to size , no matter what price .
this is called the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it &apos;s genius .
perhaps ego is called .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more work there are , the more work there are , the more things look at me , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this h@@ um . I love the h@@ um .
I need the bu@@ zz@@ ing . I am the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
am I just this bu@@ zz@@ ing ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ stated , burned out .
the h@@ um stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single work @-@ stit@@ ch .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ ters .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the hum@@ ming ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours of work , open@@ work weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no h@@ um .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a flagship Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you are doing is suddenly f@@ ading away the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ vent you , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you are working , you love what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you simply love someone else and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the sums already when the sums stop , who is one then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart ce@@ ases , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out late , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I miss it when I am Titan and I &apos;m bet@@ ting my hum@@ ming , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I &apos;m focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons , and the song in which it is going to go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost enters in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the tot@@ als slowly come back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a hum@@ ming .
and now I feel like I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the um@@ bili@@ cal sum , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I complain about shows and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the h@@ um is not strength and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the h@@ um is the stream that comes from lust for life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
true sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t like playing as much as work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to be than to be home ?
well yes , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we are spe@@ eding around in the garden , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mainly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream woman .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie replaces me .
and talking my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more does not need .
everybody can take 15 minutes , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the track !
no mobile phone , no washing , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my feel @-@ oasis , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;m leaving and winning . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to do more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes per piece , why don &apos;t allow yourself to take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the h@@ um came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz@@ ing seems to go back when I &apos;m not working .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy po@@ urs in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the h@@ um but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming .
the tot@@ als of life .
the sum of love .
the sums of work are part of me , but just one part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s snow@@ ing to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan going to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the right sum : the sum of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of being alive within me becomes broad . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel the same , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things like that , I aw@@ aken you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to heal itself .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they certainly have one of the best known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; this im@@ planted an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in emergency reception .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trauma the brain is sw@@ inging and the internal pressure increases .
in order to save lives , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to quite small children who are taken out of their families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts by Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his microscope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells which can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , wei@@ rd cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color , in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we reim@@ planted them at the removal of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we reim@@ port these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we reim@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we passed the motor motor range in the motor cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hands .
just as it happened in people , they spontaneously re@@ juven@@ ated to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the aid of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to the injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
now see , when we reim@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the mat@@ ur@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in man .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely do .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
initially , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then this study must be carried out with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to regard them as un@@ changeable appropri@@ at@@ eness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was mis@@ understood as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programmes implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if they were to change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , will be mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mur@@ m@@ uring , our future is dark@@ ened and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which threat@@ ens our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that th@@ rows its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unt@@ apped cash , which belongs to the wealthy econom@@ ists and corporations , which , however , are too afraid to invest where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars have been invested in the USA , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
$ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollar accounts for a lot of money until one compar@@ es it to the 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time circul@@ ated in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did nothing at all except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand which , like in an endless loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who would not invest in it .
un@@ willingly causes the circumstances causing o@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my hate with capitalism --
his exceedingly extravag@@ ant art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy ended too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
it would be a mistake , however , to reduce the importance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they granted them the right to political participation with equal vote wei@@ ghting in questions of state affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle that shines bri@@ ghtly , it is burned out quickly .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone .
in our today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two , gradually ero@@ ding politics and em@@ power@@ ing them .
are you wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because nowadays you can be in the government and still not in power , because the power is mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the divisions are separated .
I mentioned my hate with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of predat@@ ors that so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which they feed , so that they star@@ ve at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics so far that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , ine@@ quality falls , the overall economic demand falls and the corporate executives are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keep control , just as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we need to re @-@ create the economy and re@@ unite the business and politics sectors , and take care that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a disease @-@ like monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to that of society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used to serve people , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; to indulge in long discussions with the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it need to look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues from capital and revenues come from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
no more distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees working there , which the company does not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please introduce yourself that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; keep in mind that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency - we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is simultaneously liberal , in which it favor@@ s privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will produce such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Ha@@ ye@@ k , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and how Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also completely we@@ ary .
BG : indeed , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is happening -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
now preten@@ ding to do what the West did in the 19th century , China smells power@@ fully after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the Finance Ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
that is to say good @-@ bye to us and the per@@ sever@@ ing denial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to threaten the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this denial -
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the Euro Group , have continued to choose denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes are you looking for ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &apos; side to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to bring down our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody from the tro@@ ika who imposed this policy on us conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive sound of the talks , you seem to be still pretty pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not out@@ lived . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if it does not survive , the liberated escap@@ ees will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to adopt the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 what it seems to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studio ,
the Amazon TV production company .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an actual hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right hand side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after you have seen a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price is not concerned about the left side of the curve because I think one needs special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean balancing , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he has to make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight Candi@@ dates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online , where everyone can watch them for free .
and when Amazon makes things out for free , you access , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they &apos;re being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you skip or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these dates the show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that many people cannot remember this show because it wasn &apos;t so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 , and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
about at the same time another manager placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , i.e. the reviews they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com more than four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , now the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is the reason ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work so it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . if you come into contact , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release takes place or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
medium TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis can predict out@@ breaks of flu , a bad way -- through data analysis of the Google searches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very clever people are in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably using a lot of data to make serious choices as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years , I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and un@@ successful decisions . this pattern should be propag@@ ated .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you will mainly do two things :
first , put this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items ; as a second you put together the items together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is possible to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to put all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they made a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions first , competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what the data says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to avoid this , this device is quite useful .
thank you so much ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know naturally , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
