<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA heard illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA had literally handed over drafts to Iran for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has determined against Risen and urged him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistle-blowers and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous that they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government leaped in Risen, he did something that many brave Reporter did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of a sudden, although they say for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped on Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and risings to make statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, secretly obtained his telephone bill,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit meeting, and even travel tips with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary convicted more than all U.S. governments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional commitment because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">They can do so from the moment they get in touch, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet been published when Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmitting system for whistle-blowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation at which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer obtain information, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole, in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spionage technologies that endanger us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have the chance to bring out misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the nearest environmentalists who alarm the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect all of our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the biggest data publisher of the history was published.] [the Panama Papers reveal that rich and powerful] [huge sums of money] have hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were informed of news about a leak of 11 million documents from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a little insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say:" "" "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox firms in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, via a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agency riller or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is that when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that applies to all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are being used by some few to hide and veil their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matryoshka.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these giants.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there have so far been no prominent Americans who came up with this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But thanks to the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples of connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states, less information is needed to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has permitted cheaters to rip off particularly vulnerable struts.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "" "" "our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">We were really shocked by the fact that everyone up to one lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anyone. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as isolated cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to do this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound suspiciously as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years we have seen proposals for more transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has been registered in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to provide more transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who get up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and advocate this kind of transparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the transparency which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after finishing my design studies, I made a sale of the farm.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me enthusiastically how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It became late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Ah, please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh, man! what did I get in there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is mad?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, slipping on toes to the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something for it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and breakfast each morning.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattresses and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham omelettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all over the city. when we left our last guest and the door fell into the lock, Brian and I stared at us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Bleaching czyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website that people publicly share images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms - the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to detonate.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still very consoled would invest in a business which permits foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on things you can do well. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your mobile phone to your left neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet approach of panic that you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read their SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who is actually Al Gores cell phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is canadied for the President's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first presented himself with his name? if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 ratings, all say: "he can really stick to very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed over their assessments before we presented them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are about age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust people most of all who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation evokes common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you spend on yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">You tell too much, for example: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- -- the request is not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimum degree of openness, for example" "" "Great artworks in your apartment! I make holidays with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which issues you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who did not allow parties to celebrate or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than those calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays were only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, there can be a wonderful thing.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests was on holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save lives, even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They let one stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it simply" "" "rental industry" "" "does not do justice to the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in every place one visits, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and show one at a pub bar that you have never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would shape apartments from the ground up to the other?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume the thought of sharing a common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In Seoul's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a residence,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were mediated to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even a host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has it just worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">"" "" "" "I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me." ""</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay when check back at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">"" "" "" "studies show that the Americans think most people don't know Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I'm introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagulator fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">"" "" "" "I decided to do so." ""</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to oust myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I chose the Hijab to wear my head cover.</seg>

<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">It might stop a few parking spaces, but don't stop terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque lead to a more tolerant outlook on people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">When first the person is cut off from their congregation, even from their family, so that the extremist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or disliked by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if they recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they allow these things to be read into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said that the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists, who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and His church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways of a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show that if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are more likely to accept authoritarian governance, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows that if people report messages that have a negative impact on Muslims, they are more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you look at when the mood of Muslims pushed upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in the context of terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective guilt it is not only about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, the most generous person whom she knew.</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we rode silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, drew my shoes, went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely full.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions around the world.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet delivery came into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre-high tower of 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flight units, they reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-reliant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulences and generally react to nature laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to transcend the limits of possible within the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands can be found on the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called hedgehog,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starfish, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a flip side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flight machine no matter what position the optimal position can be achieved and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. that's okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote controlled plane. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and crossbars, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical simple, very much happens in the inner life so that it can fly stable, and can move anywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern-starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right properly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of just throwing it right, if all of you watch me is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the bus with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way, it receives the ability to have the full capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is turned or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are representable in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they have to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller drops, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further, though limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this now by flightless half of the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to become a flying shade of lamps on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy; they transformed the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">They lightened this short moment brighter than all the stars along in all galaxies of the whole world known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational waves that are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser-interferometer-gravitational-wave-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is now called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the Detector was commissioned, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes occupied through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector itself.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my todsick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational waves of black holes and their through observatories like ligo measurable signals. what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravity is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When moving the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">For illustrative teachers in courses on relativity theory often lead to a really alpine dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched during the arrival of the waves. the stretching of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. hence, one explained the Ligo-staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength far smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, as you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">Sounds are different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually, impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now is just Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob breaks her." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "dumb Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies lie in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has worked very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirping simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same chirp with an additional key change. this sounds like wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender sound] No one who knows what to listen to knows this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-times solar mass, which turn around as fast as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's briefly consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 uns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times a second before colliding.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the All and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I'd like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe from them.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen in the core, hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is covered by its own night-light.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that is most important: I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, in the first run, Ligo found things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, such as ligo it observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, age-old bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes, so to speak, are the sauerknoons for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of what is happening in space, the emergence of the stars, and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories, a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago, I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say," "" "Yes!" "", "before I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to" "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Do I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Do I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social fear -- phew, gone.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the least, calls all" "" "kittens" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I've been swayed to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the" "" "yes" "" "to play with my children saved my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think of things, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No, no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each stream offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four times four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV shows run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts I have created myself, and not just produced, so on top of that. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that are burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a store or a household, take me seriously if I talk about work, so you understand that I'm not just around the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dream job with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened into my work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">Like a high sound, you run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, arduous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best part is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzzing begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could go on her forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that when I explain to them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work and to make, create, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a humming, then you can't aspire to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of being unable to aspire to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps ego is called.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I know only that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more work there are, the more work there are, the more things look at me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this hum. I love the hum.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzzing. I am the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzzing?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, overstated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The hum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single work-stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum won't be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titers.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the humming ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours of work, openwork weekends, no regrets, nothing to delegate, a Titan does not sleep, doesn't give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no hum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a flagship Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you are doing is suddenly fading away the work you love?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "havent you, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you are working, you love what you are doing, being a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you simply love someone else and that gives you the buzz when you know the sums already when the sums stop, who is one then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart ceases, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out late, late and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me" "" "kitten" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she doesn't call anyone more" "" "kitten" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"" "" "" "I miss it when I am Titan and I'm betting my humming, and here everything changes before my own eyes." ""</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of summing, I can't do anything except watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I'm focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons, and the song in which it is going to go, or whatever the girl is releasing in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost enters in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The totals slowly come back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a humming.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the umbilical sum, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I complain about shows and TV-hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The hum is not strength and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The hum is the stream that comes from lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">True sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't like playing as much as work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person prefers to be than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well yes, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We are speeding around in the garden, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totals of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you think me naïve, for a daydream woman.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes, a ladybug or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talking my teenage daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more does not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everybody can take 15 minutes, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the track!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no washing, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my feel-oasis, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to play" "" "Play" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it.</seg>

<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to do more and more." ""</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The hum came back in my spare time. the buzzing seems to go back when I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy pours in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the hum but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzzing, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sums of work are part of me, but just one part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snowing to me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan going to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer is my head.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the other, the right sum: the sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, dying, naked and new feeling of being alive within me becomes broad. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel the same, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things like that, I awaken you to life.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the best known, the "deep brain stimulation." this implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in emergency reception.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in skull-brain trauma the brain is swinging and the internal pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save lives, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to quite small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts by Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells which can transform into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, weird cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we got our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color, in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we reimplanted them at the removal of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we reimport these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we passed the motor motor range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hands.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it happened in people, they spontaneously rejuvenated to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the aid of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who spontaneously recovered.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to the injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see, when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the maturation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant them in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely do.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials in humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill about two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then this study must be carried out with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We see democracy not as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to regard them as unchangeable appropriateness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy is waning with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was misunderstood as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programmes implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my soaked friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if they were to change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, will be mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are murmuring, our future is darkened and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of untapped cash, which belongs to the wealthy economists and corporations, which, however, are too afraid to invest where it would be productive and income that could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3,4 trillion dollars have been invested in the USA, England and the Eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion US Dollar accounts for a lot of money until one compares it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time circulated in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did nothing at all except to inflate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand which, like in an endless loop, advocates the pessimism of investors who would not invest in it.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwillingly causes the circumstances causing oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hate with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly extravagant art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy ended too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">It would be a mistake, however, to reduce the importance of the Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they granted them the right to political participation with equal vote weighting in questions of state affairs.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "the Athenian democracy did not last long --" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of the corporations -- became a democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle took place between the two, gradually eroding politics and empowering them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays you can be in the government and still not in power, because the power is migrated from politics into the economy and the divisions are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hate with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that so sustainably decimated the animals from which they feed, so that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has cannibalised politics so far that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, inequality falls, the overall economic demand falls and the corporate executives are too scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, just as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste of sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we need to re-create the economy and reunite the business and politics sectors, and take care that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a disease-like monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the movie "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or something similar to that of society in "Star Trek," in which machines are used to serve people, or in a high-tech version of the ancient "Agora," to indulge in long discussions with the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it need to look like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues from capital and revenues come from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="964">No more distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees working there, which the company does not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please introduce yourself that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "keep in mind that the entire world trade is traded in this currency - we call it" "" "the Cosmos" "" "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund invests in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested at the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is simultaneously liberal, in which it favors privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will produce such a massive decline in macroeconomic demand, which Larry Summers describes as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, that is why I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and therefore I am also completely weary.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you said very clearly what you think of the West's view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is happening -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say so provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill -</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">Now pretending to do what the West did in the 19th century, China smells powerfully after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as the Finance Ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">That is to say good-bye to us and the persevering denial that a massive fault line passed through the eurozone, and continues to threaten the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial -</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to choose denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes are you looking for?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister who, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders' side to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring down our government, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that were running through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than during the" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "nobody from the troika who imposed this policy on us confessed:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive sound of the talks, you seem to be still pretty pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not outlived." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the liberated escapees will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to adopt the path of a post-modern 1930 what it seems to me, it will be equally detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you so much that you were at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studio,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an actual hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right hand side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where after you have seen a relay, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price is not concerned about the left side of the curve because I think one needs special intelligence to offer "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean balancing, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he stops a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight Candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online, where everyone can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And when Amazon makes things out for free, you access, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know they're being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these dates the show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that many people cannot remember this show because it wasn't so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7.4, and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About at the same time another manager placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix viewer, i.e. the reviews they give to the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom more than four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, now the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is the reason?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so it is a bit scary because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. if you come into contact, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Medium TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that data analysis can predict outbreaks of flu, a bad way -- through data analysis of the Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the" "" "Nature" "" "magazine." ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people are inconceivably using a lot of data to make serious choices as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years, I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful decisions. this pattern should be propagated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you will mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items; as a second you put together the items together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is possible to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision on how to put all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they made a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions first, competing for TV ideas, then selecting "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "that is what the data says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to avoid this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Thank you so much...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a hunting or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, and I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know naturally, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
