Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an asylum institution , where young people are supposed to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small farmers cultivate the former ration@@ ale of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone knows that , which had to be exciting , because the car @-@ navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a circum@@ fer@@ ential road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavarian State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - but that is why it is very insi@@ ghtful .
especially if you compare them with current online tickets .
then it becomes clear how towns and villages have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria at@@ las is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet that one does not recognize as such .
in the great overview map , detailed maps , so @-@ called &apos; ur@@ l &apos; leaves , were incorporated into towns and villages .
these were created according to the Bavarian surv@@ ey@@ ors &quot; administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first sur@@ veying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria for military purposes - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally pulled off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a surface @-@ covering Bavaria @-@ map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying management . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ posi@@ tional Sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Munich origin@@ ates from the year 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comparison of earlier / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings concentrate around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording , &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no more farmers today - but small farmers in the facility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sonne &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is marked north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 , was the scene of the October Festival , in the 19th century was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the pamp@@ h@@ let , in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; on the host &quot; or from the height of &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße people once locked up people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based County @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the Ank@@ le of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel from using violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; said Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity did not suff@@ ice - the reason for the construction of the County Council in April 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , is located there .
in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
West lies the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in accordance with the original construction of the asylum facility , which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre .
a large one remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ track will take place .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group publishes travel warnings for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into force by 28 August 2017 , invites af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and will be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent law passed by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , dispro@@ portion@@ ately targeting minorities , prompted the Group to issue the warnings , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are hal@@ ted or killed because of their skin colour , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited events like rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel while travelling through the state and was put into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report from Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i Office , which shows that in the state , black mot@@ orists are stopped by 75 percent more often than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring a deposit money or let the relatives know they &apos;re travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report programme , which classi@@ fies the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
earlier , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further race profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately , interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ de@@ fence Project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac gave a picture on the spot .
representatives of the CD@@ U @-@ local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the wing court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially gave insights into his farm , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals looked after and accommod@@ ated in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exclusively regional comes to the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also chairman of the B@@ L@@ H@@ V , he described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot achieve profit@@ ably on such steep faces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the green area care for much work , much has to be mach@@ ined with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pointed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if it does not produce any bio@@ gas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could be withdrawn for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often critici@@ zed for funding
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were f@@ enced by eleven participants via the electric fence .
the storage area therefore amounts to 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be aff@@ or@@ ded by at least 20@@ 23 .
as a result of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders were promoted , a quarter bearing the village of Fisch@@ bach .
this means that the farmers had to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of wheat fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers it is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Poli@@ cies ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg will enable the state support of pasture f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the area to be f@@ enced should not be smu@@ g@@ gled economically ( inclin@@ ation of more than 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by for@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s electric fence project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , which would like to build a fence almost 16 kilometres , is currently underway .
the conservation area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 1,000 euros .
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ a Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restrictions on legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ers would have laugh@@ ed him if he had done so .
but he took on its importance , and in particular the meaning it was attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta de@@ but@@ ted , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem that you relate to which has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is obj@@ ectively correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s stirring words , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , / your crowded masses , who lon@@ gs to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about America &apos;s importance .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that she took a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classic depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ ile .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the significance of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atism to bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is progres@@ sing .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh has encountered quite unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .
and this is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever wish to recognise .
their torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite hatred that is their sole source of power .
world championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black praised Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
the performance director of the United Kingdom Ath@@ le@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the world championship cad@@ re will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London in 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special in Scotland is developing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ fi - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that sixteen Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the spre@@ ader Mu@@ ir runs along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
it will take part at the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that one should observe after a great season , which included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell team .
the crew captain says that she is &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of her fellow country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases will also be included in the med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb on po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers beat him because of everything , from domestic policy to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the criticism , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons , who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compla@@ ined about it at the beginning of this week .
the governor dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a repub@@ li@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary hot @-@ head .
he has shown a strong hand in guiding his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful in using Facebook as primary means to connect with his elec@@ tors and to play his hair@@ less head for chemotherapy on his side .
that is why the blocking of people coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum , which is considered official and dangerous and ultimately dangerous for employees who are paid with public tax dollars .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokes@@ woman , A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse , defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people speaking with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not professional .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , and they are perceived by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff called as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical gro@@ o@@ des or to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but this is exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to be critic@@ ised for insul@@ ting Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable portal had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters hit his lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led alongside the Arch@@ er@@ field left to the final round before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how it achieved its fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I gained it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who returned to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on the home floor .
this event will be the first Scottish performance ever since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more if you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer people have died because of the passive smoking of lung cancer .
scientists from the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( U@@ KE ) are invited to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths can be attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there were still 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße is in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat at the time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the director of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which repeatedly hin@@ ders construction work , is a major problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z of St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .

poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Reg@@ ent in the uns@@ ett@@ led Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a , &quot; directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the stolen tu@@ ber is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example washing clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a can@@ opy room is used as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be dangerous late to work : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ land of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua , the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
the city , with a population of about 19@@ ,000 , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fen@@ cing , and out of corrugated sheets transformed by rust into various yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Indonesia , Indonesia is the poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst childhood mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has de@@ composed gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua has wood resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost 20 million US dollars to local military and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ ian demands for greater autonomy threaten those golden go@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we campaign everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is up to 83 % Christian , but the demographic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants are coming from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local businesses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local who went to work in the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ M@@ um &#91; the women &#93; from Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that it will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their spot@@ lights .
one of the soldiers fired on their tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their gun pist@@ ons , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby governmental commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young people , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bu@@ sts and performed the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - continuously and im@@ itating a bird song - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started hur@@ rying stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says an official TI@@ ME document not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threat of danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on the porch of his mot@@ ley @-@ painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the assembled soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ oe , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua New Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ Police Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ ay@@ yo in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the following day after Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate talk in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he had an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ ies and beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN was accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua were already settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such alle@@ gations with fi@@ ery un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked for me , &quot; he says .
the shooting didn &apos;t stop .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has appe@@ aled to take account of the officers involved and withdraw the police from the area &apos;s mobile bri@@ gade .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a resting place for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua @-@ Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Jews by raising spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never dive up again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each of which can process four or five fields of the sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over the years , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the indigenous people of Papua and the new immigrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
they rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribe of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions in reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua with rare permission for filming .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is were not realised in order to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia &apos;s most un@@ troubled provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take this into account .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and urged him to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Chief Council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that maybe they will never give them justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to escape from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire that takes place in just two years by the high @-@ rise building , which is coinci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the people scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who called his name George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s Civil Defence authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said that it is working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the security of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its brand in 2015 showed that the largest part of the damage from the covering , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the pro @-@ revolutionary suggestion for this sport was to play Davis Cup single only on two swe@@ ep@@ stak@@ es , not spar@@ sely supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the five @-@ set classics , which are often very long , but also therefore highly valued five @-@ set classics , remain so preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will continue to work on improving the applications .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal had already come to carry out the final in a neutral location .
new from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right next year in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs of the organizers , the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers take prohibited items on the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey of flight passengers found that more than 20 percent intentionally or un@@ consciously prohibited items from the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration were sne@@ aking up , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they accidentally wore prohibited knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed that they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had gone ast@@ ray with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Charter Inc . , also stated that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules .
of those surv@@ eyed admitted that they know@@ ingly attempted to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X .
the most common objects that were pur@@ pos@@ ely passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent said to know@@ ingly carried valu@@ ables with blades carried through security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gled smu@@ g@@ gling goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely to smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - wear safety , those who are most often flying .
the company suggests , however , that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while , people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods .

electric @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys a huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far , he has under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already re@@ trac@@ ted their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the constantly triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a different , less gl@@ amor@@ ous number for the first time in announ@@ cing the latest quarterly results : the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months Mus@@ k has often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just started .
now Mus@@ k has dre@@ amt : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn .
critics have always pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay 1000 Euros ( in the US $ 1000 and in Britain 1,000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations required that Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be merged - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1,@@ 800 reservations per day .
if you order a Model 3 today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never @-@ before @-@ tested production lines without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum occup@@ ancy .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there is too much delay , then the non @-@ binding reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g caused air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of governmental environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline passed on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for o@@ zone close to earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt announced that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or interfere with economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of severe environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly gone over to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ e regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply reinforce the EPA &apos;s willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not adher@@ ed to deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set an appointment for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take fri@@ dges seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EP@@ O statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re @-@ assessment of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York general prosec@@ utor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had su@@ cked the EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - after our law@@ suits - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York connected California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ e &apos;s surprising course changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cru@@ x of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government to tackle environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche the old grav@@ ey@@ ard area in Tum@@ lingen am Sonntag , July 16th , at 4 : 30 am invited to a seren@@ ade .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius park is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens a concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel was first mentioned in the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer Ur@@ qui@@ ery : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the bai@@ li@@ ff Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the document of the document , besides the former parish church , the Tum@@ linger mountain was also a marvellous courtyard to which the Church or the patron saint was and not the other way round .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt district of Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still recognizable now in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; is the third , the man@@ orial population centre of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
in doing so , the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Lar@@ ger of the two collap@@ sed on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 @-@ 16@@ 48 ) the windows were pil@@ ed up and the bells were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from hearing schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hil@@ ary was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and the half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as success@@ ors of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
the organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gen on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old grav@@ ey@@ ard to the St. Hil@@ ary Chapel .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the closing word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
the admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers show the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade is only held in dry weather .
the organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system , which is of great importance for tur@@ mo@@ il and radio schwei@@ ler .
the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to have permission from wind turbines to be checked
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has prompted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration camp existed at the outskirts of Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration camp , the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion from wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind @-@ force concentration camp in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette only a few days before - but it did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a shape failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval notices should still be illegal and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state of the art : before the summer break , the town council has once again decided to use the wind concentration camp in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a licence from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there@@ with the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writing has gone into the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them on the occasion to check the matter again .
however , they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle decided not to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; on Thursday .
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans the construction of four wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the city Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs to be met by around 11 400 households - that is roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity requirement of all four @-@ se@@ ater households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind farm in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashed together : woman dies at terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured mort@@ ally .
two more people were slightly injured .
the state road was closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 year old young woman from Bor@@ n@@ ch , with her passenger car , drove the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion .
city and tra@@ der plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping in the city centre in September .
the trade association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to l@@ ure the inhabitants to the shopping spre@@ e to the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket commodity .
according to this , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , says Christian König .
the city administration and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this the Trade Association and the City are going to another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive city centre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ established Sunday , talks with all businesses and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re @-@ opened or re @-@ developed .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping out of sight .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ve the city - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that partly spread , king had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , said that Germany &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thür@@ inger cities .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign led by the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his buying behaviour .

tr@@ ump bets after si@@ ghted tran@@ scripts from telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leader of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump urged En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to , to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president im@@ pover@@ ished him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and unveiled a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that trade for the United States was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would let him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford massacre : activists drive rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge from Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates were ho@@ vering in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this one --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger &apos;s seat .
luckily , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only one night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens have returned to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really in@@ conceivable that in all these years there was no single person arrested - even though we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post@@ ures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the State of Georgia and a life @-@ long citizen of civil rights .
for him , it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we obtain justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays a sheet on the body of one of the victims of Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI agents , which were obtained by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one was ever accused .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the open for decades , citizens rights activists say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , the Supreme Court &apos;s decision enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com had a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or was in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed from prison and came closer to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a ly@@ n@@ ching mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy involving state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and fal@@ si@@ fying the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping , and is based on a kind of deep racism that many people would like to believe that it no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch and even more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - were forced into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
he has played the role of the boss @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor Her@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cries out and push@@ es him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , he , get away from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers wit@@ t@@ ingly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly as the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona speaks the N @-@ word , he says sharply and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , clothed with a grief , stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind , a group of about four dozen people caught silence and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song end , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse .
children sit in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per to each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and breaks down in her arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joined together with the actors for dinner .
a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ ats on a table about the rep@@ lication with a black pair they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that left the performance behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like yourself and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds farm at his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rep@@ lication is in some way inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful and fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of gigantic , six @-@ story scen@@ eries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including the wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of it , an open Mercedes classic car park is par@@ ked in which the Rhein@@ thal man is pos@@ ing as a rock yield , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels resemble Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that moves through its &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ gold daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as well as in &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
K@@ ess seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood style a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully fi@@ esen Ha@@ gen , which surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ box .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe it .
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with a strong applause .
in stor@@ my times , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bly and hum@@ bly bow their hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated stor@@ my .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat in casual leisure sports@@ wear .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
in 2013 he had to let go of a gl@@ itter@@ ing Pfei@@ f@@ konzert , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown up with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also has grown an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive summary .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I work here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked in the open whole day at the school .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does this come about ?
lot : I did a high school diploma .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself , what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe also , really .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably do a social worker education in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you can be FS@@ J .
you can do it from the old home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that prov@@ oked me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; unlike in civil engineering studies ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lot : sure , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ ati@@ ks .
one always has other people &apos;s head , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a youth who has been fet@@ ched out of the family - one must always deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and they had no reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives you a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
job cuts , which Director General John Fall@@ on announced by the end of 2018 and early 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 points have already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May a third cost reduction plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that has been hit by the fast pace towards digital learning .
the company , which last month sold Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged after the first half of the year saw an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ b@@ ings
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , told Nato .
according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
bombing is the last violent act that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of NATO it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had occurred when a common pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive device carried by people . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan because US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government , their policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay The Smo@@ g Ru@@ le By C@@ ats To Del@@ ay
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , according to which states are obliged to contain smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states accused the agency because of the cr@@ ot@@ ch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced the decision late on Wednesday to press ahead with the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt in June announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to delay more stringent air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a broad range of environmental regulations that the former President Barack Obama has imposed on as part of a broader agenda , which , according to Tr@@ ump , aims to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and nature reserves who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the website of the EP@@ O states that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and enhance respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for example asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : with two votes , the council of flu@@ ori@@ os @-@ win@@ king decided to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land section was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it will take a long time before the church is still owned by the church community , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be undertaken by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters floor space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council flo@@ ats that such a common area should not be seen as a meeting point only for residents of sen@@ i@@ ent living , but openly in the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , will be missed by funding opportunities .
the construction is in the rehabilitation area .
according to T@@ j@@ aden , the establishment of a common room would be supported by 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed resolution provides to signal the investor that he does not want to throw a bil@@ l@@ board between his legs in this respect , the fact that saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding building - as well as pul@@ pit roof - which reduces the lift height and makes the construction more economical - all possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer doesn &apos;t just mean this additive .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , it happens to the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which you don &apos;t get along so well , but now you lean out of the window at the common room , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really doing it with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger does not necessarily speak for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
she sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface there is no surplus , but receiving a real counter @-@ value that is market@@ able in the case of doubt , is the opposite .
Sta@@ ig@@ ner &apos;s request to obtain the proposal accordingly finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises : &quot; if we sum@@ mar@@ ise the decision , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
at the crossing of the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was severely injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from direction Hil@@ den on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction gave him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the opposite traffic .
he joined a car , which controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a rescue truck .
Bayern Munich must ren@@ ounce on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to sau@@ te@@ y the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the winner of the Cup .
the personnel provide the German football record master Bavaria Munich before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 a.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to ren@@ ounce David Al@@ aba in du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the Mün@@ ch@@ horns Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory season of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed by the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the resin in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the Verein Stern@@ warte St Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet route exists in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes against the need for information of many resin visitors , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question boxes St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ ei@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the panels is to be supplemented by internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a part in selecting a location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ tup train will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path the viewer experiences a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more light than any other although it is far further away .
it is also possible to medi@@ ate in which con@@ stellation a selected star is found and when it is best to be seen .
the association has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently , from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 there is something similar to the planned star @-@ life - the planet route - at the initiative of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet route leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ ground &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( congregation of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a ball of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact 75 meters distance of the sun still measures 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet route is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would still take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a potential show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN &apos;s offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down the hall to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super @-@ suspension body@@ guard .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visi@@ oned World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former Feder@@ weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not that big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to come down to lightweight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko was right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko had to fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interested in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23rd September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later expressed himself openly to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he value Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injuries to tire bur@@ sts
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the outlets of the market just before the outlets of the market .
the car rolled to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the North for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane was passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann , after 2 : 2 , hopes for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optimi@@ zing the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , wouldn &apos;t be the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must fit better in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain is to be further optimized .
and a gate after a kick @-@ off , the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to catch any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one will stand alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope better with the three @-@ chain preparation than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will act in au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just finished in the three @-@ chain of Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not have so many errors in building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if we stand at four points on Sunday and can focus on the trop@@ hi@@ es , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight seasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped early because of an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players out of Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 % where they are at present , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Fort@@ una &apos;s inner defence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are a light favorite on Sunday to meet at last ( almost ) finished sta@@ di@@ ums of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away , only because we have the right to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record in only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s chief coach .
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new findings from the Swedish asylum @-@ age assessment test published
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden submitted to a new method for medical assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( medic@@ ament sales ) commen@@ ced the tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Department ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged to be 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly under 18 years of age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been steady during the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged for more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det investigated the 5@@ 81 results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age evaluation , where X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see if they were usually preceded by pu@@ ber@@ ty earlier or later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to assess a child as an adult is small . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in that case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the country road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are proceeding well .
a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete section on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very well in time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three renovation needed bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long respectively .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning on the north side got a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border for@@ tification , which is also used as a way of operation .
on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to proceed .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of cables by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires a special touch of intuition .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs on the project .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard and the collective farm towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by traffic lights .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed .
the costs for the three re@@ group@@ ings amount to 700@@ ,000 euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties move on one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties represented in the C@@ U ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the loud poster &quot; Great Elec@@ toral Campa@@ ign . &quot;
and well @-@ known names start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the top duo for the parliamentary elections on 24 September , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les , but to demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city @-@ pick@@ nick under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the well place , but now takes place on the parking lot below the rear - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that is there .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which also the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered a lot of police officers to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports about the Af@@ D volcanic Ei@@ fel , he tried to get such an event and received the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there are not enough parking spaces available .
so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pe is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ person Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate to vote for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can move away - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tro@@ mb@@ one encounters trumpet
a meeting with the Wolf@@ man Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte morgen , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have sole positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
this is Pet@@ kov &apos;s solo trump@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross boundaries on their instruments , but also to blend the boundaries of different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach works with the two musicians as in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music , &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz pianist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games combine to form a fascinating synthesis of art .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was Robert P@@ att@@ inson &apos;s &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague who ultimately dealt with bitter feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ ess ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with whom I have requested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation Kri@@ sten told them that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but during school times when she rather dressed like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to act in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the Party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thought ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in rejo@@ icing .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 counts , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states , and his father inherited a coal business .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement in which it said : &quot; the change of the Party of Gover@@ nor Justice is a further blow to a Democratic party which would rather prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; said the Chairman of the Council , Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel , in an explanation to the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed again .
Russian athle@@ tics chef D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were taken away with gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized for itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force recommendations that it is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still working free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral ceremony for soldiers dispat@@ ched in Mali
during a funeral service in the north Hessen town of Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash occurred in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Minister of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the un@@ resolved cause of the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the mour@@ ners laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the fallen soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operation of the fight @-@ helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; if this occupation failed to a@@ vert the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen , did not show : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country that we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave near his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard has already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and took the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the leader of the Danish King &apos;s House , declared .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old finally will be , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , was born in 1965 .
at the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
while his later wife always listened to the sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand during his almost 50 @-@ year reign in the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed his criticism of the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked in place of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had the reputation to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP of possible majority in Lower Saxony
after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday he spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before that , the surprisingly ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating Gre@@ ens from their Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen justified her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants his group to welcome them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
to date , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the Land@@ tag quickly resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament chooses trust and chooses a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be checked legally properly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in silence if they are legally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ life@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a char@@ tist of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the de@@ pu@@ dent de@@ pu@@ ties to return their land of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that she returns her country @-@ day mandate , which she received via the green list of countries , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Gover@@ ning Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests exceedingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I deliberately decided not to conduct any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no contex@@ tual differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transgres@@ sion of the Lower Saxony party members El@@ ke T@@ westen on the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) &apos;s decision to quickly elect the Parliament .
the leaving of T@@ v@@ est costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her ver@@ itable vanity and fru@@ stration of her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony carries this dirty in@@ filtration and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lower Saxony &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed T@@ life@@ jackets to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 Parliament election with personal care@@ gi@@ sts .
at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD and the SPD and Gre@@ ens had a w@@ afer @-@ thin majority of one vote in the Land@@ tag .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from greed , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) Spe@@ ech and Ans@@ wer .
Herr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from contaminated eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder will provide the latest information on the eggs @-@ Char@@ gen concerned .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , according to all we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has turned up@@ side down and since the announcement of Germany &apos;s sad@@ ness , it has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessments are available for the consumer .
as well as the manufacturers , the trade has to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual sugar level of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded with eggs , these are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
as far as knowledge is concerned , the production plants do not meet immediate guilt .
on the contrary , they have to expect economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , in the case of serious cases , there are too few controllers .
is it missing only at the staff or in the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were , however , the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out as 100 percent .
precisely for this reason , a consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the public prosec@@ utor in cases where criminal off@@ ences may be present are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ ting really necessary for food and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and traffic @-@ free foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pan@@ de@@ mic means that manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
at all levels it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure .
I expect from all the relevant authorities that the facts will be clari@@ fied spe@@ edi@@ ly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the financial rules of the football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expenses of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will still come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that supervis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched by the UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G will have to prove at some point that N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can surely make the money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring it to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich mi@@ stress family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be controlled with legitimate means of revenue enabling them to break even the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the clubs debt to monitoring their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen out of favor by the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out @-@ clause by N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing on the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Cat@@ ar@@ usi@@ an enterprise could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Championship will be ambass@@ adors and that such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that the PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot@@ ics .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature has been signed .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s leaving , claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country owns an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for the Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is ready before a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order .
Swiss @-@ speaking spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request from the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products are reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packed sho@@ cks distribute 14 grams per year before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss didn &apos;t want to give any information about the costs .
insi@@ der insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders according to &quot; Northern Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
the Swiss will not want to reveal how many applicants will be involved in the new tender .
however , only Swiss manufacturers will come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract over spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
Swiss Life Holding has distributed chocolate bars on board its flights since 2006 .
before Swiss Life concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
Swiss made the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class with treats of the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli are p@@ am@@ pered , in Business Class nas@@ chen passengers Sho@@ gg@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distri@@ butes both business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the eigh@@ ties , for the 90 @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; turned for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a pleasant can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow up - nevertheless they managed to win back the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his adults now playing adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the casting technique principle , among them a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at one point , a character clas@@ hes with an Apple Power@@ book , some Inline Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there &apos;s another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious plot that Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good idea by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s mu@@ sta@@ che of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old ro@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of random del@@ u@@ sions that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches what I assume as its logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its east @-@ west @-@ west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , is to be a bound TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lica , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching TV watching TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de the voice out . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rade det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was edited on a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , because Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef constantly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do anything for food for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian authors were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and thei@@ rs .
impact on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in hitting the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ Kreis , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office announced on Friday .
at the same time , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials made larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros .
at the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects of Italy , there were German warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore likely to be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has established const@@ ancy against organised drug traffi@@ cking in Southern Germany .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Tor@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
that is why the large @-@ scale deployment on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nationals with close relationship to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
way lam@@ bs large gaps in the foreigners register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to partly grave mistakes in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Affairs of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out a media report to large gaps in the country @-@ country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the register , ten million people are registered with foreign nationality , including approximately 5.@@ 7 million out of non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by some 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data had not been adequately cared for , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data input can considerably slow revers@@ ing processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on a sufficient number of people , EU citizens are also included who do not have to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these false attri@@ butions , however , resulted in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distorted debate on the use of tax@@ pa@@ yers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. , in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they are travelling from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper therefore reads that the BA@@ MF leads such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement it is responsible for refugees from the EU state which they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to its territory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy gave guarantees for the recording and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other EU states would also send back refugees to the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ul , who has now donated 50 litres of blood to his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome how our body is designed for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the circle preparation leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;

at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher talked about the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K circle preparation leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the spec@@ ulations about a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates down to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members striving to increase in this month as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 , to 1.6 % , and warned that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alized that in the coming years interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation that was heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that the cost of credit would probably have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus package published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - at 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the rate of interest , it was repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for cooling inflation and a &quot; slightly bigger &quot; scale than the markets would expect .
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts revised down@@ wards for this and next year are 1.@@ 9 % and 1.7 % compared to the forecast predicted in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound dropped after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on any change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest income and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening first becomes worse before it becomes better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which is compensated for by lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote which caused the decline of the fun@@ nel .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to complete the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest income increased because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers in July called for an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has fallen from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will be tigh@@ tened again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; given the recent down@@ turn of the swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive once again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those with which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with due @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment as early as September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ exposure pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pre@@ p ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being provided by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed last year a ruling by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to facilitate registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ occupation pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in risk of infection .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications may be taken every day or so already two hours prior to intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable candidates are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also sign up for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive sourcing .
the study will assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted specifically to vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS funded effort in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individual controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Ter@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now has to be that the study is quickly done across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p testing has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and termin@@ ate the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt gives us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study will be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people infected with HIV and that they will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have converted these little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , turned out to be an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively in order to solve the task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel mill is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but laying the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area for the mezzanine .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge mou@@ th@@ el lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we offer mirr@@ ored units space for all cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ wei@@ ghted so that if you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square footage of something as standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a confrontation over one of Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s largest real estate empire worth more than $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict of separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have acquired 38 homes worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a store at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the family founded the West@@ co Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - of Paul as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the family De LU@@ TI@@ S describes about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s property has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed negotiations .
the brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - what Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases in the case , with hundreds of pages with monkey da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held lawyers .
Ms. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950s and bought a store in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first den@@ im of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started in West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , where Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ drew even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted with Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ ling@@ backs of new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
others tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reported that the White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House Chief of Staff , met with senior staff on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that got into the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Candi@@ date Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep t@@ witter habit under control , according to six former electoral officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady rise of praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . that &apos;s okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that the Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials do not know what others do not know - that Tr@@ ump T@@ we@@ ets would have included more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep his anger away from him several times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently aver@@ ted it that Tr@@ ump has prov@@ oked controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the advis@@ ers to give the President dou@@ bt@@ ful information to the president for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with humili@@ ating le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously accused the President of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief secretary K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has sold false accus@@ ations in the past , and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work and document the pump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective as a Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked to pray and hope .
this summer the police in all of Europe sends out postcards to dangerous criminals .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after severely disabled people are not known , references from the population will be hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action following the winter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting at holiday destinations were hiding , it was called Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanting , more than 2.5 million times , has been viewed .
36 of the online applications could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to references to the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are once again with some resol@@ ute travelers at war @-@ foot , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn from the congregation to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road called Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire Series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were ej@@ ected until May , but without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their failures .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travelers were there in May , were moved on and are now back again .
more came last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area . &quot;

in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by invo@@ king 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambi@@ ence Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH as of April 13 , 2014 approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not un@@ disputed in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald , defended the hotel location , and at that time spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els , Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has already been standing in front of the entrance for a longer time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations will take place .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with about 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , says Sch@@ erer .
the noti@@ ons of the city were identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the external installations are also placed on the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : U.S. Special En@@ voy sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ ers Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee accepted the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling for people familiar with the business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N reported that there were already first members of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to pur@@ pos@@ efully interfere in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were discussions between the campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focused on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took a closer look at more and more Tr@@ i &apos;s private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump has personally moved to the centre and investig@@ ates whether the President could not obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges are to be charged .
the Grand Jury , therefore , are also called indic@@ ative bun@@ als .
they are usually turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the committee can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in order to invite individuals to act under oath .
according to the CN@@ N , invitations were already issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ ump consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his brother @-@ in @-@ law Paul Man@@ a@@ fort during the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the translation show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary he would act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
nevertheless , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of new revelations , the President on Thursday evening made use of a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the setting up of a Grand Jury .
but this also usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that ha@@ sten@@ ed the special promot@@ er &apos;s work in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey had said three times that not against the President .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed because of this , that it continued in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this failure , accus@@ ations against tr@@ ump were loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump urged him to set up investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would be released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the pres@@ idents of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of repub@@ li@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday that the special agent could no longer be dismissed as easily as possible .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ c@@ tica
in West Antar@@ c@@ tica a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has settled from the ice shelf .
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , which weighs over a tri@@ l@@ lion of tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , now dri@@ es to the north and will probably need two , three years until it is melted .
with a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered in the past three decades .
it is not a danger to people .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ outs in the region for some 30 years , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now abor@@ ted col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this gul@@ f , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was disturbed some years ago .
A@@ WI scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen writes that a complete shelf is broken down there .
there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never moved as far back as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key place .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and ic@@ e@@ berg does not raise sea level because they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it results after melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a lesser extent , the British research project writes for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ts is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters .
it breaks regularly there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra will now grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers do not rel@@ inqu@@ ish the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many ice ages of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have collap@@ sed in recent decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ c@@ tica stretches in the direction of South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees over the last 50 years and therefore counts to areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants to use Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at personnel
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U asks to step out of the employers &quot; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs were drow@@ ned in administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants are working for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now again 17 trainees have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips at the circle are obviously highly sought @-@ after .
some 6@@ 20 applications were posted for the places to be sold this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 non @-@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration .
together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , the CD@@ U would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration should develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , highlight concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who ex@@ crete absen@@ ces due to illness or age due to age .
so high time for action so that not even more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter races , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he took care of a bad surprise already in the circle of the district , when he publicly questioned the c@@ apping of personnel and the other parties were amazed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be checked , which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should strive for a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better for employees and officials than to actually see the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly dict@@ ated , increases or more money are only available if one changes to a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself on professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ rik and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone of NGO migrant lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Secretary of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Save &apos; because their team had worked together effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has been in operation only a year ago , refused to comment on the detailed alle@@ gations of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio &apos;s Italian prosec@@ utor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our highest priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations currently being raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that the crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are supplied to them by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board , who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not ent@@ ail any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
recei@@ pts and tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine wis@@ er bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome feature .
the first tour led to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .
observation points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were always longer climbs for the long tri@@ bun@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
again , there was a look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected with &quot; fla@@ gged &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breathe healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pal@@ at@@ inate woods from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of law@@ ns - Bundes@@ liga ass@@ esses itself for e @-@ sport
are sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium lawn by wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has also been recognized by the first federal authorities who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire very new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is sure that there will be a lot of clubs coming up on this train . &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
apart from Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advis@@ ing an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal particularly with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that the young people will continue to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially Asian .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga team to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the FIFA simulation FIFA will be cont@@ ested at a competition level .
long ago , as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and for the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also needs cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid responsi@@ veness .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise their body and mind nutrition not only on the console but also on their body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems with ac@@ rob@@ atics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
the players are on the road internationally , it &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
turnover is expected to be at 130 million in three years .
this is not enough for the almost 2.4 billion Euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
however , e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte couns@@ ell@@ ors write .
many countries are already on the move .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez take part in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in Europe , things are happening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a subject , &quot; says F@@ rob@@ bing .
in the Netherlands and France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ associations , according to D@@ utt , are meanwhile obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany la@@ gs behind in European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to decay only in nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is not enough today .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but at the same time al@@ ig@@ ning the company on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to that only in football everything stays as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy pushing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free up to his vocation .
she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter was standing with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and looking down eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find out that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , saying that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where I don &apos;t feel the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I surround myself with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this only person with whom I have been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; get up , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is shift the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter to pay attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the event by any press .
the case has the legal opinion shared .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder of her British co @-@ mate in Italy in 2007 before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ my of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ i was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern won a big season for the Con@@ fed Cup winner - an extra motivation does not hurt there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ my and also no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he took the rush to the arm .
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian master .
good , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i also could interpret the sign of the coach .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was made up of young players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from the holiday , but he .
sugar cane is best distributed to those who want to have a lot of ingredients to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to compete in the inheritance of Lah@@ my can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ mir affir@@ med : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ ck@@ ered as mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
to the right , that is his position , the white bond on the arm did the rest .
and Kim@@ i worked in this starting formation as the one who can take the ru@@ dder best into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated trou@@ pe .
he had a view of the whole , while many others were engaged in themselves .
in his first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ ko@@ t , Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not neg@@ ate neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked quite well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ i , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both of them acted confi@@ dently .
the nam@@ i@@ ously occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le tried again a few times in the game @-@ up .
his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mitt@@ edly admitted that the result was &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also taken for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ usually this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one saw afterwards the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not give in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but certainly six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i said goodbye to a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more .
Al@@ aba Moti@@ ves O@@ F@@ B La@@ dies
David Al@@ aba believed in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has reported on Twitter shortly before the game and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wished all the best .
the Bavarian legi@@ on@@ aire is a club colleague from Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and plays with our La@@ dies .
the twe@@ et of the Austrian football club of the year and Champions League winner was to be a special motiv@@ ational sp@@ lash .
maybe our ladies might need the famous Bavaria @-@ Dus@@ el as well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ sing Tempo
it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year , in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old ministers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest down@@ turn sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap closure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 will be the construction law .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ circum@@ vention of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal traffic route plan .
the aim is to take the course in operation in December 2020 , says Minister spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
in this , nat@@ us sees a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive enterprises .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , aims at the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports bag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , pra@@ ises the Chamber of Industry .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euros is provided for the passed champion examination and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves independent within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
however , the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is quick to provide facts , and at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Industry of Trier .
up to now , only 29 vac@@ ancies have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to employ Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Industry calls for more contracts to be assigned to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U Group Vice @-@ President , points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 less than suggested in the receipt of state roads .
in addition , Frank nat@@ us is expecting a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is also the current broadband expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies rated net supply in an I@@ HK Survey only with a rating of 3,@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ outs .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still sitting on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they had already cleared the field after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Chairman said that the company believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itting diesel engines are regarded as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alizing exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles also makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plot@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back under normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in engine development by Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to Volkswagen &apos;s winning over propor@@ tionally .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft runs through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
if you go to Is@@ ar again on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that &apos;s not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Construction Department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large Inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter .
it shows a Müll@@ berg .
the launch of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen as a protected game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los bil@@ l@@ n@@ oses and laughter against sorrow
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most published carto@@ ons carto@@ ons , the no@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
also at 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an records and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he worked as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artist has always been inspired by cities .
large , round Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning he is still sitting at the drawing table today , working nearly ten hours a day .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , cu@@ dd@@ ly toys and watches , his funny figures still find widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a cartoon and TV series with his figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main character in the movie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack of thousands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they &apos;re going to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
this is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is reproduced verb@@ ati@@ m .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and due to diseases that transmit diseases , which makes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the ag@@ ro @-@ research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is highly endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ des , a micro@@ bacterial that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary .
the highlight of the festival is Saturday and Sunday with a Medi@@ eval festival .
shop@@ keepers , guil@@ ds , traders , vag@@ ants or a landing camp should be in the city center on these days .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the Week@@ ly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting about the latest chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they have been told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room : enemies , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and gut feelings range .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government or cart@@ els &apos; pay@@ roll list , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break of violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has been in office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and until now , there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .
among the latter is their editor and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters during the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ent and even though the terrain is even more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to go a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el controls the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first there was in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival box fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this release may have anger@@ ed the children , presum@@ ed gang@@ men bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without pushing for the toxic@@ ity problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising grew .
re@@ porters ende@@ avor@@ ed to publish harsh investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take over the task that comes to you as a journalist - either you or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing ways to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , keep away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that spy@@ ware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a central @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who the governor said to themselves as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has written three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known speaker Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to state expendi@@ tures focused on the city &apos;s home town .
and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducting a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , who dominated all political levels almost throughout the century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were charged with high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this area , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers would have watched the Val@@ dez column as the most informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff became something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ bbed a few characters and the next morning he went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der than they have written in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of sp@@ ying journalists and letting them be killed because they told the truth .
she has since been asked to re @-@ divide it from the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has allocated more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mur@@ ders obviously have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ set lay beside her separate head .
several branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addresses the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for danger .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , acknow@@ le@@ dges that drug traffi@@ cking does not frigh@@ ten him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to h@@ um .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the spa of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as it was promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they have released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ l near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were willing .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the same day , when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to avoid enemies
at first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so well received that they even realized that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of an &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r examples in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has start@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed to be out of place from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ ump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you b@@ link only a little with your eyes , you can almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , is probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter@@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed mixing better into its surroundings and do@@ d@@ ging its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arms about his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprisingly , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted with enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong car@@ ni@@ v@@ ore behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r shows how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs predat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to look at the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including his preserved bow@@ el content , in order to find out what he ate as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern Florida today , and rivers and oceans are likely far more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k @-@ time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just put a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the King of them , Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six @-@ ton@@ ne monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal of Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta drow@@ ned after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the preserved ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that were prot@@ ru@@ ding from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept away by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater world of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste still cover still b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &quot; rare as winning a lot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers crossed upwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at its sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
a heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are many wounded , kilometres long St@@ aus and G@@ aff@@ er .
around 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on Thursday afternoon .
after the first indications of the police there were about 30 vehicles between the jun@@ ctions of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm , among them trucks , including trucks .
the exact number of injured persons initially did not provide any information .
a police spokesperson said that it was light to moderate injuries .
a great supply of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , an approximately ten kilometres long back@@ log was formed .
as an A@@ Z journalist reports , it also occurred on the counter @-@ road to massive handi@@ caps - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade noted the characteristics of the vehicle hand@@ le@@ bars , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is clu@@ eless in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a genius idea .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and ar@@ ouses one uns@@ af@@ e or ri@@ ps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the road@@ worth@@ less ticket control .
one simply confirms by a mobile phone that one takes his seat and de@@ valu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the offer comes , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trains the ticket de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you must have booked an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers .
it is also necessary to buy it via the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the test customers , a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears .
the train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that Pass@@ enger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train driver arrives at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already dispos@@ ed online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel without ticket control by our train crew , the DB navig@@ ator simply checks for yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s Marketing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to their individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who train often know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because of@@ ten@@ times , however , one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , resulting in poor sen@@ timent in the evenings or large spaces and delays in controlling one &apos;s own tickets and the conductor will take the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that applies only to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; et Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only a day after she had arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed live by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she stopped her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people crying out and from a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father , who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman said his ri@@ fle and scre@@ amed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll kill you ... animals all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have gotten used to and which we can typically call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened over the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence , which consists of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown , the two talked a talk , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people need to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she was saying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed not only to know activ@@ ism and organization , but also to know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to get free to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would have a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has totally changed after August 9 , &quot; she said and noted that she was President of the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l to the point : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was fed by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their ability to resist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other natives , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brown &apos;s shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader but a community coming together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the de@@ human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ de Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
black gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is truly held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film based on her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman there is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared long ago , but the racial ties between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people even though it is not yet built .
but the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been out@@ dated since the first presentation in 2009 in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents .
there is hardly any cold on the subject .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one at the bit Galerie says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , as the rest of the business also benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian prec@@ inct is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds where the farmers market hall stands , where 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the start of the construction work will be finished .
the Gallery M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with the possibility of sitting outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; for many years now , we have been shopping in the farmer &apos;s market hall almost weekly .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ladies always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ ch@@ ery for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing says : &quot; whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should probably not be too low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s the shopping palace in Bit@@ burg ?
be it clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores , or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is already enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a good weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see , shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the rentals there are often not tra@@ dable for a retailer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; too bad , special transactions almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together for me .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall go on during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run , when the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming .
or does the ghost bit @-@ gallery manage to distribute all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that stands empty .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall there is no place thanks to the incredibly many - as I think - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg .
once the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence after she publicly sponsored diplomatic reports about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2nd is a resem@@ b@@ lance to A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
by algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data might look like , a sharp , albeit some intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted for 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just returned from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not attend this time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal e@@ ye@@ witnesses who changed several letters during the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic &quot; Supp@@ lies Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future where the president would convert the judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , calling Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually remedy .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her over@@ sized signature called ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ fold of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people hopefully will take with us is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories so that &apos;s 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic amend@@ ment .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free speech in the hand of the disciplinary tables of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they place your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ators , who assemble like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that stuck behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of murder .
a country@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on July 27 .
officials got a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene and det@@ ectives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ itt , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail explaining that La@@ them had now been assessed and excluded from entering the campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ itt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explaining that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in touch with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something had happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was not clear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
security cameras confirm that both them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ establishing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ing &apos;s words were consistent with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov stated problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one intends to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA dop@@ ing sc@@ andal in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als in Russia .
however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli told R@@ US@@ A@@ DA to move &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
these were divided by the groups of companies .
it was a purely precau@@ tionary measure , it could not be proc@@ eeded further from any health impairment , it was stated in the message .
from now on only eggs are likely to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lice .
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency in his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s did not work .
responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called for help from the outside .
a new Human Resources Start @-@ up Race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to perform surveys , to provide special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T won .
in addition to the S@@ nap poll@@ s and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance what units have the most complaints and which leaders have low con@@ s@@ ents - so you can drill down why .
companies come to see that at the forefront of workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next U@@ ber involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the Finance Website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
U@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
and when the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion has recorded regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , &quot; Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the enterprise uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by managers who sit in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group by Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment law@@ suits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter@@ ing secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es .
the employees want to have the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that owns their votes , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors gain yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough or not at all , dis@@ appointments can be raised and employees can dem@@ oti@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , employees wonder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you concerned about this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to take action the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on the campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it actually prolon@@ gs their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the breaks have shifted the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood have done practical exercises .
20 before the start of formal game preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they continue to plac@@ ate , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think , as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already cleared a protective net behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task .
brother players are to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook aims to intensi@@ fy facts check in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties fac@@ tual audi@@ tors and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fac@@ tual audi@@ tors that may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the major distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to be punished by social media networks if they fail to get rid of hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in English that a test of the new facts check was launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to the recognition , which stories are challenged by third parties fac@@ tor@@ ed parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970s and 1980s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Bew@@ are River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opolitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steer ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ y May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found un@@ expectedly emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s that worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thumb print !
and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome &quot; ) this all seems too nice to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena pots on the walls and the bottles that had been spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive that he described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer &apos;s uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &quot; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex , &quot; Rho@@ des says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rol that the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century depicted his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite a guest , always making debts and spending money for things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men sol@@ ed their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent for recru@@ iting land@@ lady . &quot;
Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences after the end of his work in the castle .
he has taken a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle envel@@ op@@ ed in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the closing of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a celebration at Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the cul@@ mination of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too nice for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the poster at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website that was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , she stands in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost an average five @-@ digit amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Turkey &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts about reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting took place no longer in the headquarters of the general staff , as before , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of Government , the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and External Action took part in the consultations under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of Government .
thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ population .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the army , the air forces and the na@@ vy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 16@@ 9 has fired 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire educ@@ ator of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people allegedly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean up the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ ease in the Military headquarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the General Staff , there are concerns about increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among other things in the lifting of the head@@ gear prohibition for female soldiers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the great deal with the army and the security forces goes on .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan dispat@@ ched another 73@@ 95 civil servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they lod@@ ged their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeting an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an especially not@@ e@@ worthy officer was waiting for asylum from persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave Nato cold .
in any case , after cleansing , there are doubts about the Turkish army &apos;s readiness to use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law shall be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will l@@ essen poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens are being dealt with in other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English that have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media .
Ministry wants to san@@ e track for race ticket shuttle
over the past few months , over and over again , the future of the race car sh@@ utt@@ les has been cont@@ ested - now it is supposed to go quite fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before the end of the year , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourist train &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built on the ailing track . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to secure the future of the race car sh@@ utt@@ les in the long run , construction work on the route should be started this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to order and san@@ e the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country ad@@ mits to this particularly important link for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Minister of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it cost about 2.5 million euros for the repair of the track .
from this sum , the country takes over 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , will be finally agreed , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operator are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race platform shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017 .
the race platform shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the course of a pilot operation in recent months , it has been tested whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to regularly order them again in the future .
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought it could not become even cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , emer@@ itus professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a st@@ eppe @-@ woman progres@@ sively look . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they are appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
she also has her m@@ oods in the course of the day - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female features , the allu@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , rest@@ less a most .
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is said on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
its emergence and its increasing sophistic@@ ation point to somewhat darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men , of course , will not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their rising popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what sick@@ nesses out of the fr@@ ing@@ es can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not stran@@ gely or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
there is , however , a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has been bo@@ ther@@ ing to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most app@@ alling aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the out @-@ out eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words : they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : ma@@ ids
do pumps deliver great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump Er@@ a that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the hor@@ r@@ ors of tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we all preten@@ ded to burst into our filter bags .
less has been noticed the power of bringing together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist den@@ ser who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone he knows , including the repub@@ li@@ can kin@@ ship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same page .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but I notice in a wider context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the imposing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and &quot; tr@@ ump , &quot; we refer to the gru@@ es@@ ome possibility that his bi@@ bs will no longer be rep@@ elled .
there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards .
I find myself coming from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump are indeed a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump passes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels in the New York car park , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ led and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the music @-@ per@@ ing music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have all a great time .
if I could have scored the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this does not only lead to slow@@ ing down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically bur@@ sting while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts to his hand@@ lers , which he suffered from prison authorities after a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to the first death sentence because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to take this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ el , from which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Prosecutor said that it was lod@@ ged with the Supreme Court of South Africa and the acqu@@ itt@@ al could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the last of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Blum@@ berger schools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; school pupils from caps and don@@ ors have been dischar@@ ged to school holidays and secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three of the graduate students will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , the school manager An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 pupils of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young eagle , who grew up in the chickens yard , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lower Sch@@ ar performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chickens yard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of chickens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of turning a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , and the eagle lifted its wings on a high mountain and disappeared .
after that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tail .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les that bore cylinders to make the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished for every four @-@ person child that he felt accepted in his new school .
it was followed by a thank@@ fulness to the colleagues , former head of the school , Michael Müller , who again and again came in with teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks and the parents &quot; representatives .
the cooking time was over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher announced .
after two years of teaching , she was very reluct@@ ant to leave school because it had been a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door si@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end all students let a song of summer time and holiday fade away .
with the children , great joy broke out .
eight first @-@ class students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on TV , spoke with .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal refugees was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camping and suggest to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they should improve the emission behaviour of cars from the emission categories Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives evaluations :
is the new promotion obligatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates are only valid for vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
its retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Motor Transport Authority ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a quick implementation over the next few months , but not yet called a precise date .
Daimler communicated to each affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the scope of the inspection .
how long will it be possible to move retro@@ fits altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen that car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the topic of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ace is waiting for you to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would prefer to follow S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat to a massive drop in price of Euro 4 cars ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
so far there is no loss of value for older dies@@ els in rural areas .
the ace advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Award Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
as announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and take part in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the prize @-@ winner Le@@ ar , announced with progressive TV series , already announced that he would refrain from attending the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even to ev@@ ade them - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tr@@ ump to make clear her views .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
the former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , reti@@ res in retirement in the coming year .
the place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister since 31 years .
and the work still makes him a lot of fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks , which await his successor .
at the same time , he is surprised that no application has received the requirement profile so far .
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - considering the regular period of notice - shall be enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach is acting as a sub @-@ building authority for the administrative community , the applicant must demonstrate corresponding degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would no longer be able to fill it out , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and to it , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated to look back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure of the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , diverse projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking place are encountered .
the kin@@ dest bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still subject to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a master builder of great le@@ e@@ way .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener you can react very flexibly to many things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town is listed as a monument protection ensemble , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city building master emphas@@ ises .
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of experience : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for the past ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .
if you would like to bury Roland W@@ acker , after information from the town of Has@@ lach , you should have a completed academic degree as a diploma engineer or bach@@ elor with special@@ isation in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and planning law .
the Municipal Building Authority is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , construction management , underground estate management , municipal property management , urban courtyard with building yard and urban gardening , as well as the Building Law Authority , including the protection of monuments .
bicycles suspended on lines : southern railway line blocked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and look for them since the night hours .
close to the crime scene , a rose @-@ foot@@ man sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver had been seen by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Lus@@ ati@@ a coup , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators would have put themselves in great danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ oti@@ ves and the system , as well as the delay @-@ minutes and the cost of rail replacement , P@@ ön@@ als of the railway customers could also come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the speaker said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a significant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern run@@ way could be run without obstruc@@ tions .
just under ten passenger trains arrived on Friday morning , two of which were on the road .
freight trains did not fall , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ urable condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal system .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues .
if the balance tends to get too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice bearing a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an food intoler@@ ant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also works in humans .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was but separately accommod@@ ated , did not have this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given to the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , the researchers let L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
as the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by around 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice , and most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a genius to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a genius , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday commen@@ ced and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the pre @-@ preparation Asia tour of the blues and achieved only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho promised he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI to start the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made three more commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fulfill three of its four priority new obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association for that , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great pains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the US , which is several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertisement earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel still was the SPD leader , social @-@ demo@@ crat Prime Ministers still looked for Berlin with a certain concern before the elections .
only no stor@@ ks from the party headquarters , but no head@@ wind from the federal government - was the most important wish of the electoral fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House observe with a growing horror the events in the regional capitals of the SPD .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds .
they were deep @-@ hits .
and one by one .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green is simply not reliable to go@@ vern , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the S &amp; D Group &apos;s surprising escape from a Green Party has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Federal managing director Michael Kell@@ ner called on the rebel@@ li@@ ous low @-@ Saxon @-@ Saxon @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen immediately must res@@ ign her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German president and election campaign leader of the Green Party of the German Editorial Board ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election fighter si@@ gh@@ ed when the new hi@@ b message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the Social Demo@@ crat of the Social Democratic Party of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority following the passing of the green MP El@@ ke T@@ westen there .
it is the preliminary cul@@ mination of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD &apos;s state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery began with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , the comrades were re@@ ass@@ uring at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this was done - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to maneu@@ ver , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ d beat the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ gged back in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just dar@@ ed new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit of Hamburg arrived .
and with him came the next deep beat .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nim@@ bus on that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in crisis communication after that , what can be done wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
and now Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been in criticism for some time now .
additional survey results were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Wei@@ l always tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former Mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also remained un@@ concealed in Martin Schulz &apos;s environment .
they allowed him to grant him a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite might occur .
at the same time , Wei@@ l does not blame the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , the comrades attempt to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian , T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen presented her own career fairs on the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M. Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party leaders in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. T@@ westen is not elected as a direct candidate because of her person but on the country list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens , so the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische legislature on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony Social Democratic Party into the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career path of a future CD@@ U negoti@@ ator distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to know if there has been more or given further commitments from the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
subsi@@ dy funding for local people III
those who want to be able to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
on Wednesday , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of STE@@ G urban development were informed .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what has been happening .
since 1991 , there have been areas of re@@ development .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the area of refurb@@ ishment from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , previous renovation is a &quot; success project &quot; - it is also important to promote interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that it will be a rehabilitation area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 euros are from the country , the rest from the municipality of sens@@ ations .
what is the result of a rehabilitation area ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to investigate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is interest at all to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the territorial boundaries could be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening the STE@@ G represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal @-@ country programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the renovation would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out in an object @-@ related manner , that is , per plot .
the rehabilitation area would eventually be set as a stat@@ ute .
the grants period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September of this year , however , the inventory should only be carried out in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , as far as possible , the order intake is to be carried out in order to start renov@@ ations next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann concluded that each commun@@ e had to carry out the above @-@ mentioned preliminary examinations .
the aim is to evaluate and decide on the urban planning , when san@@ iti@@ sed and to what extent .
for the respective land I will also register a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um in the register .
once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
that is why there will be questionna@@ ires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and plot arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where it is concerned with the structural condition and renovation views among other things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and Home Office &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , division and residents of a residential space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Operating Bo@@ w &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be completed if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it should be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of resources according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , grin@@ ds first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is no need for funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to conclude , some photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Plac@@ ement II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to the medical standard .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am would like to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now fitted at home as well as with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology that begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yer thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American production last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military that has been left to TI@@ ME magazine up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice @-@ President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all over the world .
the helicopter produced in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was exhibited beside a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire engine and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi fork lift truck .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only wanted you to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the H@@ MX @-@ 1 commander on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy commander of the aviation industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3@@ pm and so long remained until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 in that evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second crew will be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security guards stayed on the ground during the time on the plane .
from the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the destiny .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but demanding their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the president &apos;s plane served against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to dep@@ ose US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 exercises in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was one of the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a be@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential missions . &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden on none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement percentage for the V@@ H @-@ 3D amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
the unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wal@@ ters said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates involve personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , ref@@ itting rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the White House press spokesperson , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss faces tri@@ cky job
leading the runner @-@ up of the second tennis league joins the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 : 00 in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
in spite of five games still imp@@ ec@@ cable record , the leader of the Second Tennis League has made sense for reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that is always playing in a very similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
imports from the high North ensure a class and stability at the S@@ V district .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to stak@@ es in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas B@@ jer@@ rot@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as always difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is convenient .
Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four could give his debut for blue @-@ white .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man active at the Chall@@ enger event in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man does not join the Bundes@@ liga Game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament will be at his first use this season .
the hitherto un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo , with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky , was still playing at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el .
he should be present in Kiel , but also like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on the last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , also Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again move into the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , someone from the trainer stor@@ k around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump really did not feel happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his capacity to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the congress contained a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Moscow reaction was as sharp as it was expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the U.S. offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft fores@@ ees to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors from the local O@@ MV are al@@ armed , which co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian east sou@@ l@@ lion North Stream 2 together with other European companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dr@@ one is huge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump should even bring the sanctions to life by an executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has viewed itself which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

scroll for@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city re@@ organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with solid contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centers the watch is turned back .
on the 1st of September Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in own control room .
for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , deputy director of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooked is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooking .
the city runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
last year there were 28@@ 00 children seated at the tables , and the demand grew steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are taken care of 45 hours of the week are eating in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita zu lunch@@ time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in 35 @-@ hour care when children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen service starting on 1 September : they warm up the supplied food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , leave the meal off , rinse , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ group , as well as seven @-@ group@@ ed facilities - decides on the hour &apos;s circum@@ ference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen workers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for hospital management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also why it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of kitchen performance also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in the cost comparison for the city as the most economical one , it is from the Press Office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for around 750 people in the field of education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ on , acting head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women vote in the provinces in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ pres@@ idents and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , elections for the first time will hand the power peac@@ efully from democr@@ atically elected government to the next elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ on said a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women from total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
according to the police , the men were talking about the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2 : 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone with the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the cell phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed .
without a prey , the duo fled .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to make sure that the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow is assured by Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s managers .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company talked about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which in addition to other products hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ in said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s urged to &quot; express concern that funding for modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workers focus strongly on the local community and the Glasgow area , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the prospect of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ in said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it , as we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we like all the companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , continually scrut@@ ini@@ ze our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga is interested in showing her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
in her pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the record of the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about how N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside although a source near the Catal@@ ans board insi@@ sts that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prices for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter turned and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown killer has intentionally revers@@ ed a roller in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the estate number 30 and so on the cl@@ adding of the vehicle repaired material damage of more than 200 Euro .

the police witnesses are looking for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to ev@@ ade him and tou@@ red the guard rails .
on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au to Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the location of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to turn right .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report acqu@@ ires Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse is reli@@ eved by Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is believed by author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , speaker of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after the publication of the former Regensburg Bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the dis@@ counted Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand critici@@ zed the fact that there was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the reporting of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regards to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ af@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis also commented on Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &apos;s interview : &quot; you &apos;re going to go to the church and this is a fake &quot; Fres@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows were a quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of the mis@@ use cases , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely un@@ ju@@ stly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who auth@@ ored the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the report report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report published by the lawyer Ulrich Weber of the dioc@@ ese Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990 &quot; s with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of aggression , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in the final report , it is said to be Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it can be said that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students could also be more violent .
however , in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even associate positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took on his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre@@ ferences of Viol@@ ence Ex@@ erc@@ ise at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister George R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many pupils emphasize his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who has become tangible for the latter , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name George R@@ atz@@ inger is common at all .
he has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school took place outside of its sphere of influence .
one can at best repro@@ ach him , learn from it too late or have not taken the first indications seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz grammar school , which he worked on , was perceived as literally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presented an excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; intel@@ li@@ gible , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy and was &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which sometimes led to wre@@ ck hat@@ ching .
the fact that he did not only kne@@ el with chairs and threw the key@@ ring on the floor , but also spread ear cow@@ ard@@ ly and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he has already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his honor , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s , both parents and teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think every one of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state high school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violent exc@@ esses at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are certainly dre@@ ads .
one asks oneself if it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media just fell on him .
at the Bavarian pop@@ e many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report weighs on Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , much about the issue of abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen has been reported in connection with the report .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also accused of any involvement or complic@@ ity in sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : definitely no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the afflicted on behalf of the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ ligh@@ tenment of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators in a professional sense .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role be assessed in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able disciple put it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and would have been able to stop the respective perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it seems to him ... Bu@@ ben more urgent and clear or even more open than in relation to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... is un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report concludes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the run @-@ up to affected students and / or their environment , it was not possible to confirm in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free to speak of any co @-@ knowing .
neither can he be accused of having prevented or brought him to an ad .
therefore there is no reason to associate its good name with these contradictory crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media there was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; View &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
namely , it is separated clean@@ ly : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the domain @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , let us say , other alle@@ gations .
the report also covers incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Cathedral .
the whole horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were regularly har@@ assed and painted , and among them horri@@ fic , all took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister George R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz @-@ Gymnasium .
on this , as most witnesses emphasized , the subject of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o .
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz grammar school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even associate positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , at most , the repro@@ ach still remains to have looked away .
but in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported about the conditions at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as a witness ) did not want to hear , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger concentrate on the states consistently ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz grammar school , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool the testing penalty will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test pen@@ alties in Bavaria were long forbidden .
before that , they occurred in a legal gray area , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate where those affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible border had been crossed .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the testing penalty was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis stated that it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time of that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging the past according to contemporary moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was disgu@@ sting at all times and also not for what has been banned in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence to innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that at that time .
that &apos;s all horri@@ fic and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work up .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his ways of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. ear cow@@ ard@@ ly and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his time in Regensburg has shown Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing penalty also available ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , as the cats only played a side role .
nevertheless , I do not at all conc@@ eal that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world @-@ class institution , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and candy you alone make your un@@ ru@@ ly boys not a great singer and stand before every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something in a fly .
I regularly receive with him how many former head @-@ cats still today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who do not forgive him today that he once was stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of them are grateful to him today for en@@ riches their lives and bringing them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect person , to which they still look and ad@@ ore them .
and please , once again clear : all that is accused of him are educational methods which were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
but it is most unfair , a man only because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him .
now the An@@ war would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
