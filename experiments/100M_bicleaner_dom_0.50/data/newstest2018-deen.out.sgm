<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An asylum institution, where young people are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small farmers cultivate the former rationale of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that, which had to be exciting, because the car-navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a circumferential road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavarian State Government, are anything but up-to-date - but that is why it is very insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and villages have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria atlas is a patchwork carpet that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the great overview map, detailed maps, so-called 'url' leaves, were incorporated into towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveyors "administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria for military purposes - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally pulled off with the peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: it was the present neighbours who created the idea of a surface-covering Bavaria-map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying management." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "the" "" "Urpositional Sheet" "" "for Munich originates from the year 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of earlier / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered pieces from the so-called "original recording," from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no more farmers today - but small farmers in the facility" "" "Land in Sonne" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is marked north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810, was the scene of the October Festival, in the 19th century was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the pamphlet, in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "on the host" or from the height of "Auf der Lüften," but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße people once locked up people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based County-Irrenanstalt" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the Ankle of so-called" "" "Irren" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel from using violence against the inmates, "said Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity did not suffice - the reason for the construction of the County Council in April 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, is located there.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in accordance with the original construction of the asylum facility, which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing raids.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main square" "" "in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allies bombed many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-track will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes travel warnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will come into force by 28 August 2017, invites afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in the entire state and will be noted here," "" "said the Group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law passed by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to claim discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the Group to issue the warnings, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are halted or killed because of their skin colour, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard before." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited events like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel while travelling through the state and was put into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report from Missouri's Office of the Missouri Office, which shows that in the state, black motorists are stopped by 75 percent more often than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be willing to bring a deposit money or let the relatives know they're travelling through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report programme, which classifies the state in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further race profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately, interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weidefence Project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac gave a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the CDU-local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the wing court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals looked after and accommodated in five apartments Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">Exclusively regional comes to the table of the Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also chairman of the BLHV, he described the" "" "elementary" "" "project as" "" "elementary" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "I cannot achieve profitably on such steep faces." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for much work, much has to be machined with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with topography," "" "pointed Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not produce any biogas.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the land could be withdrawn for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often criticized for funding</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants via the electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="85">The storage area therefore amounts to 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be afforded by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">As a result of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders were promoted, a quarter bearing the village of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">This means that the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of wheat fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers it is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiss also stated: "the best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Policies (LPR) Baden-Württemberg will enable the state support of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be fenced should not be smuggled economically (inclination of more than 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by forestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fishermen's electric fence project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, which would like to build a fence almost 16 kilometres, is currently underway.</seg>
<seg id="96">The conservation area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 11,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fira Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller didn't handle the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imiters would have laughed him if he had done so.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took on its importance, and in particular the meaning it was attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta debutted, "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem that you relate to which has been added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is objectively correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's stirring words, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your idleness, your poor, / your crowded masses, who longs to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about America's importance.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that she took a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exile.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early Neoconservatism to bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is progressing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh has encountered quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever wish to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the way, but ignite hatred that is their sole source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">The performance director of the United Kingdom Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member contingent of the world championship cadre will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butfi - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth World Championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that sixteen Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The spreader Muir runs along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>

<seg id="151">"being so special about team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the papers beat him because of everything, from domestic policy to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the criticism, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 persons, who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hot-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a strong hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as primary means to connect with his electors and to play his hairless head for chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">That is why the blocking of people coming to the Governor's side is a public forum, which is considered official and dangerous and ultimately dangerous for employees who are paid with public tax dollars.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people speaking with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not professional.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," "" "she wrote in the commentary area of the news broadcast" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject, and they are perceived by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's staff called as" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical groodes or to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portal had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters hit his lead.</seg>

<seg id="425">Now Musk has dreamt: of the total of 518,000 pre-orders 63,000 had already been withdrawn.</seg>

<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production site.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be merged - 500,000 will be one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of Smog caused air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of governmental environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is about a deadline passed on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ozone close to earth." ""</seg>

<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of severe environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>

<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prue regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumour celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche the old graveyard area in Tumlingen am Sonntag, July 16th, at 4: 30 am invited to a serenade.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius park is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingens a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 the St. HilariusChapel was first mentioned in the Württembergischer Urquiery: Graf Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the bailiff Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the document of the document, besides the former parish church, the Tumlinger mountain was also a marvellous courtyard to which the Church or the patron saint was and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Freudenstadt district of Freudenstadt from 1858, beside the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still recognizable now in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "Berg" is the third, the manorial population centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The law of patronage arose from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">In doing so, the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Larger of the two collapsed on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the windows were piled up and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from hearing schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the church of Hilary was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and the half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem take care of the "creative pensioners" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius system.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organisers invite the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade on the old graveyard to the St. Hilary Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with words from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "Hartmut Romann" "" "says the closing word." ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">The admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organizers show the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade is only held in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius system, which is of great importance for turmoil and radio schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and sponsors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirmed.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to have permission from wind turbines to be checked</seg>
<seg id="505">"Boisheim defends itself" does not see any legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Councillor.</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim defends itself" "" "has prompted Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration camp existed at the outskirts of Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration camp, the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion from wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones should prevent" "" "savings" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">The city Viersen had decided a second wind-force concentration camp in the Boisheimer Nette only a few days before - but it did not approve the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a shape failure.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval notices should still be illegal and therefore also to be taken back," "" "said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of" Boisheim "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="513">State of the art: before the summer break, the town council has once again decided to use the wind concentration camp in the Boisheimer Nette; a licence from the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "Erkens:" "" "therewith the granting of approval for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "the corresponding writing has gone into the circle Viersen since last week," "" "said a spokesman." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them on the occasion to check the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle decided not to comment on the argumentation of the association "Boisheim" on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the city Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs to be met by around 11 400 households - that is roughly one-fifth of the electricity requirement of all four-seater households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind farm in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="532">Bath Langensalaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The trade association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September in order to lure the inhabitants to the shopping spree to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should sensitize customers what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket commodity.</seg>
<seg id="535">According to this, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places.</seg>

<seg id="538">In doing so, the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation, commercials are on the radio, an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend, says Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">The city administration and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">"" "with this the Trade Association and the City are going to another stage of the project" "" "Attractive city centre" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offers such as the first "active day" to the well-established Sunday, talks with all businesses and hosts, in order to move them to active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potential is to be re-opened or re-developed.</seg>
<seg id="545">This includes spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping out of sight.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end everyone would have to contribute to revive the city - up to landlords, the factories of the whole city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that partly spread, king had said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, said that Germany's third "home shopping" day, for the first time, took part in five Thüringer cities.</seg>
<seg id="550">In addition to Bad Langensalza are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.</seg>
<seg id="551">"" "the day should" "" "promote appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities," "" "says Streich." ""</seg>

<seg id="719">The British educational group Pearson said on Friday that they will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut their dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces.</seg>
<seg id="720">Job cuts, which Director General John Fallon announced by the end of 2018 and early 2019, in addition to its previous restructuring, where 4,000 points have already been lost.</seg>

<seg id="728">On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="729">In an opinion of NATO it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had occurred when a common patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an improvised explosive device carried by people. "</seg>
<seg id="730">The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital on the Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qaragh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan during the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.</seg>

<seg id="734">The Taliban said they had done this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadliest militant attack of the country, since the US-led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="736">Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan because US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country.</seg>

<seg id="748">In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes, the council of fluorios-winking decided to set up a common room in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing land section was signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>
<seg id="750">Although it will take a long time before the church is still owned by the church community, there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be undertaken by a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common room.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - about 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters floor space for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the Municipal Council floats that such a common area should not be seen as a meeting point only for residents of senient living, but openly in the congregation.</seg>
<seg id="755">"" "as an example, the word" "" "Strickcafé" "" "made the round." ""</seg>
<seg id="756">The decision, which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, will be missed by funding opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="757">The construction is in the rehabilitation area.</seg>
<seg id="758">According to Tjaden, the establishment of a common room would be supported by 60 percent of 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposed resolution provides to signal the investor that he does not want to throw a billboard between his legs in this respect, the fact that saddle - which is leaning against the surrounding building - as well as pulpit roof - which reduces the lift height and makes the construction more economical - all possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer doesn't just mean this additive.</seg>
<seg id="761">When it helps: unanimously, it happens to the body.</seg>
<seg id="762">It is not as easy as the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "Daniela's call refers to the many own buildings with which you don't get along so well, but now you lean out of the window at the common room, she says," "" "I'm really doing it with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger does not necessarily speak for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">She sees behind it a covert subsidy to wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">This is not the case, because with the purchase of the surface there is no surplus, but receiving a real counter-value that is marketable in the case of doubt, is the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="767">Staigner's request to obtain the proposal accordingly finds three proponents.</seg>
<seg id="768">So it remains with two counterparts in the original program that Stefan Haller summarises: "if we summarise the decision, we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of the football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenses of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars's world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will still come to Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the guiding organization that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched by the UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can surely make the money loose for Neymar to sign and bring it to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich mistress family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must be controlled with legitimate means of revenue enabling them to break even the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini according to his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the clubs debt to monitoring their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen out of favor by the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, opposite The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out-clause by Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing on the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catarusian enterprise could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was inflated by Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar World Championship will be ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the current sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that the PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with sales of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricotics.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature has been signed.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars leaving, claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for the Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet co-operation is ready before a possible end: the airline will rewrite the order.</seg>
<seg id="1161">Swiss-speaking spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request from the news agency sda an appropriate report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1166">The Swiss didn't want to give any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Insider insiders estimate the volume of orders according to "Northern Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious order.</seg>
<seg id="1169">The Swiss will not want to reveal how many applicants will be involved in the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">However, only Swiss manufacturers will come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract over spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss Life Holding has distributed chocolate bars on board its flights since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before Swiss Life concluded a contract with Migros's daughter, Barry Callebaut has delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">Swiss made the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>

<seg id="1194">And there's another crazy-vicious plot that Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good idea by Michael Ian Black).</seg>

<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's mustache of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old rocker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random delusions that could heat up this franchise as a sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until it reaches what I assume as its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band how to visit the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>

<seg id="1199">The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, is to be a bound TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulica, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>

<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Public Prosecutor's Office announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">At the same time, 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and had already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officials made larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">At the time of the same raids in Italy, two people were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Against the two suspects of Italy, there were German warrants.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are therefore likely to be extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the Great Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have converted these little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, turned out to be an Earls Court apartment in Knightsbridge in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in Knightsbridge with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">"" "" "" "Erfan had to think creatively in order to solve the task." ""</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel mill is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but laying the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">A classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area for the mezzanine.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge mouthel lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we offer mirrored units space for all cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is counterweighted so that if you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"" "" "" "at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," "" "said Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">They have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you do not love the electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by good design and increased square footage of something as standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a confrontation over one of Victorias's largest real estate empire worth more than $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict of separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have acquired 38 homes worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a store at Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the family founded the Westco Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De LUTIS now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">"" "after an agreement with her late father Colin - of Paul as" "" "main operator and the dominant personality" "" "in the family De LUTIS describes about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third." ""</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin's property has a value of $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The allocation of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">The first hearing of the Supreme Court took place last Friday after several failed negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - what Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with monkey davits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De LUTIS and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen from the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first denim of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started in Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, where Colin claims that Mark has paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are, Paul" "" "has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin withdrew even though he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from the year 2015 by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted with Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I really can't say much," "" "because the case was before the courts." ""</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reported that the White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House Chief of Staff, met with senior staff on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that got into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Candidate Trump was angry because of unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," "" "said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady rise of praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. that's okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that the Twitter habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials do not know what others do not know - that Trump Tweets would have included more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep his anger away from him several times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently averted it that Trump has provoked controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the advisers to give the President doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with humiliating leaks, and that he can find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">This was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused the President of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief secretary Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has sold false accusations in the past, and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "he read the article and started asking employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork and document the pump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be more effective as a Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambience Betriebsgesellschaft mbH as of April 13, 2014 approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time the decision was not undisputed in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's Mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location, and at that time spoke of serious interested parties in the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels, Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it to a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special promoters Robert Mueller should have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the committee accepted the work over the past few weeks, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "calling for people familiar with the business." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN reported that there were already first members of the committee in connection with a meeting between the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to purposefully interfere in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were discussions between the campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation focused on several men who acted as advisors to the republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took a closer look at more and more Tri's private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump has personally moved to the centre and investigates whether the President could not obstruct the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine present evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges are to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">The Grand Jury, therefore, are also called indicative bunals.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are usually turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee can also be turned on by the public prosecutor's office in order to invite individuals to act under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN, invitations were already issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. there were also Trump consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his brother-in-law Paul Manafort during the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the translation show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary he would act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of new revelations, the President on Thursday evening made use of a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates all measures that hastened the special promoter's work in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey had said three times that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed because of this, that it continued in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this failure, accusations against trump were loud, he wanted to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June of a Senate Committee, Trump urged him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>

<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In West Antarctica a giant iceberg of the almost seven-fold size of Berlin has settled from the ice shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was confirmed by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus, which weighs over a trillion of tons and 5800 square kilometres, now dries to the north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered in the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">It is not a danger to people.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakouts in the region for some 30 years, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now aborted colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeits lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this gulf, the balance of waxes and abruptions was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI scientist Daniela Jansen writes that a complete shelf is broken down there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is some evidence that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never moved as far back as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate stands under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key place.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not raise sea level because they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it results after melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a lesser extent, the British research project writes for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeits is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks regularly there.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">"" "among scientists is disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeira will now grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added:" "" "our models say that it will be less stable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not relinquish the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice ages of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctica stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the last 50 years and therefore counts to areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are still 50 non-occupied places in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration.</seg>

<seg id="1563">The overall concept should focus internally and externally, highlight concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>

<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly dictated, increases or more money are only available if one changes to a higher level, which orientates itself on professional years.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Save' because their team had worked together effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has been in operation only a year ago, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of Ambrogio Cartosio's Italian prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our highest priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in a statement on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only assess all accusations currently being raised after collecting all the information and assessing the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that the crew will take dinghy migrants on board, which are supplied to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting occurred allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of exposing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board, who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1627">In e-sport, computer games like "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the FIFA simulation FIFA will be contested at a competition level.</seg>

<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobbing has dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>

<seg id="1737">The Handwerkskammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new Master Bonus, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.</seg>
<seg id="1738">A premium of 1000 Euros is provided for the passed champion examination and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves independent within ten years after the master's training.</seg>
<seg id="1739">However, the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">The planned road construction is quick to provide facts, and at the same time the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Industry of Trier.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are regarded as carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of the car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralizing exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles also makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plotting the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back under normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former Head of Thermodynamics was arrested in engine development by Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes to Volkswagen's winning over proportionally.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and due to diseases that transmit diseases, which makes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agro-research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is highly endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small cicades, a microbacterial that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting about the latest chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They have been told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room: enemies, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings range.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government or cartels' payroll list, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break of violence, and while the corpses accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto has been in office in December 2012. 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection and until now, there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their editor and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Feodoce building. two reporters during the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder Federal Attorney General was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodocice they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolent and even though the terrain is even more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to go a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel controls the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First there was in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival box fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This release may have angered the children, presumed gangmen bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without pushing for the toxicity problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising grew.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters endeavored to publish harsh investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you need to take over the task that comes to you as a journalist - either you or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you tell what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodocice team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for routine destruction?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing ways to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, keep away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodocice met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a central-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who the governor said to themselves as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"" "" "" "it is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control." ""</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has written three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to state expenditures focused on the city's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor, conducting a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who dominated all political levels almost throughout the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were charged with high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this area, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers would have watched the Valdez column as the most informed source of abduction.</seg>

<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was devoted to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the staff became something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and the next morning he went to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"" "in the whole country, journalists have become louder than they have written in organized protests" "" "SOS Press" "" "on walkways and buildings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is gone away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them be killed because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since been asked to re-divide it from the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arms about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprisingly, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that dinosaurs were hunted with enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong carnivore behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," "" "Brown said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to look at the animal for clues about his life, including his preserved bowel content, in order to find out what he ate as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern Florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely far more widespread than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "" "Brown said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chalk-time." ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just put a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the King of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11,5 m) long, six-tonne monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal of Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta drowned after death in the sea and mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the preserved armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that were protruding from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swept away by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater world of the dinosaur preserved its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the Hautreste still cover still bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as "rare as winning a lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right foot rests on his side, his five fingers crossed upwards.</seg>

<seg id="1972">A heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are many wounded, kilometres long Staus and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Around 20 people were injured at a mass arambolage on the Autobahn Stuttgart-Munich (A8) on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first indications of the police there were about 30 vehicles between the junctions of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a storm, among them trucks, including trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The exact number of injured persons initially did not provide any information.</seg>
<seg id="1977">A police spokesperson said that it was light to moderate injuries.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A great supply of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of travel in Munich, an approximately ten kilometres long backlog was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As an AZ journalist reports, it also occurred on the counter-road to massive handicaps - through numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle handlebars, which now have to be reckoned with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a passenger car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: nothing is clueless in the train and sleeps.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you must have booked an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to buy it via the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "because the" "" "comfort check-in" "" "works like this: one gets into the train, calls his ticket under" "" "My tickets" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">For the test customers, a button for the electronic devaluation appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that Passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train driver arrives at number Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already disposed online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "if you want to travel without ticket control by our train crew, the DB navigator simply checks for yourself." ""</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who train often know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are one of the biggest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because oftentimes, however, one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents needed for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passenger, resulting in poor sentiment in the evenings or large spaces and delays in controlling one's own tickets and the conductor will take the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that applies only to the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2021">Only a day after she had arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>

<seg id="2040">What happened over the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, which consists of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge by Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has totally changed after August 9," she said and noted that she was President of the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food-justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "everything has come." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2060">"" "one question came from Ferrell to the point:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt occupants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives, the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.</seg>

<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and for the dehumanisation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferris's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayde Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves the people even though it is not yet built.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been outdated since the first presentation in 2009 in proponents and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">There is hardly any cold on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one at the bit Galerie says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, as the rest of the business also benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the grounds where the farmers market hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year custodial sentence after she publicly sponsored diplomatic reports about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2nd is a resemblance to A Becoming resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">By algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone with these genomic data might look like, a sharp, albeit some intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted for 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just returned from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg in a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not attend this time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal eyewitnesses who changed several letters during the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Supplies Images," which foresaw a future where the president would convert the judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, calling Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually remedy.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning with her oversized signature called (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfold of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take with us is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories so that's 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic amendment.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free speech in the hand of the disciplinary tables of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they place your speech cold, then they have won," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "so never stop your mouth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"" "" "" "it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," "" "said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia." ""</seg>

<seg id="2159">A countrywide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who are looked for as suspects after a man has been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the District Court of Cook County.</seg>

<seg id="2208">She called for help from the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resources Start-up Race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to perform surveys, to provide special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases Whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-suite executives and to turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap polls and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance what units have the most complaints and which leaders have low consents - so you can drill down why.</seg>

<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the Finance Website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>

<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee turnover and complaints, "Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the enterprise uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden by managers who sit in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.</seg>

<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to have the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that owns their votes, and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors gain yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough or not at all, disappointments can be raised and employees can demotify.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data." ""</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become even crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a steppe-woman progressively look." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they are appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there's the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">She also has her moods in the course of the day - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, restless a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it is said on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Its emergence and its increasing sophistication point to somewhat darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, will not hold sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their rising popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what sicknesses out of the fringes can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strangely or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is, however, a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are emerging at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has been bothering to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most appalling aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the intricate body and the out-out eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words: they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the language of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Do pumps deliver great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump Era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horrors of trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all pretended to burst into our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less has been noticed the power of bringing together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist denser who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone he knows, including the republican kinship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely strange on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but I notice in a wider context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the imposing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and "trump," we refer to the gruesome possibility that his bibs will no longer be repelled.</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario, normalized in the trump republicans of the right wing, which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself coming from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump passes, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels in the New York car park, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growled and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the music-pering music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as two-year-old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have scored the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This does not only lead to slowing down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologetically bursting while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was hospitalized due to the treatment of cuts to his handlers, which he suffered from prison authorities after a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to the first death sentence because of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to take this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appel, from which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecutor said that it was lodged with the Supreme Court of South Africa and the acquittal could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is at risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, retires in retirement in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been the Stadtbaumeister since 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him a lot of fun, as he mediates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied, but also demanding tasks, which await his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, he is surprised that no application has received the requirement profile so far.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - considering the regular period of notice - shall be enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach is acting as a sub-building authority for the administrative community, the applicant must demonstrate corresponding degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would no longer be able to fill it out, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But closeness to the city is important to the city and to it, says Wacker, who reports about a good working climate and a good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "says Wacker, and the design of green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">Since the old town is listed as a monument protection ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the retiring city building master emphasises.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the Stadtbaumeister bears high responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is a builder," "" "in the end everything runs over my table." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2560">With care and coordination he can count on many years of experience: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for the past ten years.</seg>

<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further development of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">If you would like to bury Roland Wacker, after information from the town of Haslach, you should have a completed academic degree as a diploma engineer or bachelor with specialisation in architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of construction and planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University discovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal system.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance tends to get too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have shown that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell is found in mice bearing a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an food intolerant to tryptophan promotes less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also works in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was but separately accommodated, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomas of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given to the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2672">Those who want to be able to renovate his house in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">On Wednesday, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development were informed.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information session, Schindler once again gave a review of what has been happening.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been areas of redevelopment.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the area of refurbishment from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, previous renovation is a "success project" - it is also important to promote interior development, and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe received the information that it will be a rehabilitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros are from the country, the rest from the municipality of sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2681">What is the result of a rehabilitation area?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "you will continue to investigate," "" "Schindler" "", "where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is interest at all to rehabilitate.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial boundaries could be postponed again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">On Wednesday evening the STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "cellar presented the contents of the federal-country programme" "" "Social City" "", "where the renovation would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out in an object-related manner, that is, per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would eventually be set as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The grants period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September of this year, however, the inventory should only be carried out in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, as far as possible, the order intake is to be carried out in order to start renovations next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann concluded that each commune had to carry out the above-mentioned preliminary examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The aim is to evaluate and decide on the urban planning, when sanitised and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">For the respective land I will also register a memorandum in the register.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Once again, Pietzschmann will come again to sensations and get a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">That is why there will be questionnaires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">"" "the yellow questionnaire is the" "" "building and plot arc" "", "where it is concerned with the structural condition and renovation views among other things." ""</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>

<seg id="2865">In her pursuit of Neymar, Paris Saint-Germain will not leave Neymar after giving an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the record of the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president before this prospect?</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report acquires Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse is relieved by Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is believed by author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, speaker of the reform movement "We are Church," declared after the publication of the former Regensburg Bishop and current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the domain master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the discounted Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand criticized the fact that there was" "" "double standards" "" "in the reporting of violence at the Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regards to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful deeds" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scarafia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarafia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also commented on Bayerischer Rundfunk's interview: "you're going to go to the church and this is a fake" Fressen. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows were a quite normal pedagogical means" "" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of the misuse cases, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely unjustly, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes, who authored the book "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the report report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report published by the lawyer Ulrich Weber of the diocese Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990 "s with high plausibility" victims of aggression, 67 Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to be Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister was used in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the students could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, in contrast to numerous other defendants, many victims underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger took on his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Preferences of Violence Exercise at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "reports a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister George Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many pupils emphasize his" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as choleric and perfectionist, who has become tangible for the latter, when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name George Ratzinger is common at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the excesses of violence at the pre-school took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can at best reproach him, learn from it too late or have not taken the first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatz grammar school, which he worked on, was perceived as literally" "" "salvation" "", "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presented an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "competent," "sincere," "competent" and "intelligible," as extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and was "always surrounded by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which sometimes led to wreck hatching.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only kneel with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor, but also spread ear cowardly and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he has already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widely used in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violent excesses at the preschool, these are certainly dreads.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One asks oneself if it is not more likely to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">At the Bavarian pope many who have never understood him are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report weighs on Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, much about the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen has been reported in connection with the report.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: definitely no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to be entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk to my father or mother," "" "said one of the afflicted on behalf of the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a professional sense.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role be assessed in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable disciple put it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and would have been able to stop the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it seems to him... Buben more urgent and clear or even more open than in relation to their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... is unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this is how the report concludes:" "" "that in the run-up to affected students and / or their environment, it was not possible to confirm in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free to speak of any co-knowing.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Neither can he be accused of having prevented or brought him to an ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate its good name with these contradictory crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media there was much of" "" "violent excesses" "" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former domain master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "View" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent excesses and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, it is separated cleanly: between the pre-school and the high school of the domain-cats, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, let us say, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also covers incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were regularly harassed and painted, and among them horrific, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister George Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already at the Domspatz-Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On this, as most witnesses emphasized, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatz grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even associate positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most, the reproach still remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported about the conditions at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as a witness) did not want to hear, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger concentrate on the states consistently?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz grammar school, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out," "" "that in the preschool the testing penalty will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as test penalties in Bavaria were long forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal gray area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible border had been crossed.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the testing penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis stated that it is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about" "" "pitfalls of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger of judging the past according to contemporary moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was disgusting at all times and also not for what has been banned in the pre-school of adversity and violence to innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all horrific and I'm glad that it will finally work up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His ways of disciplining and punishing, i.e. ear cowardly and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he has also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his time in Regensburg has shown Georg Ratzinger in the talks with you for the book" "" "My Brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing penalty also available?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, as the cats only played a side role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not at all conceal that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy you alone make your unruly boys not a great singer and stand before every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heart-good people from whom you can't imagine that he could do something in a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive with him how many former head-cats still today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him today that he once was stern to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of them are grateful to him today for enriches their lives and bringing them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect person, to which they still look and adore them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clear: all that is accused of him are educational methods which were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unfair, a man only because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which has just been published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the Anwar would command a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
