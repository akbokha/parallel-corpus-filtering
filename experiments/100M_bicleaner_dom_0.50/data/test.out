28 year old cook found dead in San Francisco mall
a 28 year old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local grocery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the victim &apos;s brother Louis Gali@@ cia told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank initially lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly each day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has any information about the case will be asked to call the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always plu@@ gged in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston needs not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star clear in an interview now un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or stuck out from the outside label , who have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are more s@@ nu@@ g to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is regarded as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
the act@@ ress most likes to spend her time at home , in front of TV with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white glu@@ t , she brings the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all@@ uring mother of two sons .
the film runs with us on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Py@@ ramid of Sports
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses came back to their holiday , they hun@@ ted home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this speed , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and with that the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he let himself run with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even shoot himself for photographic purposes .
it was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German sports aid handed the man from hausen as part of a small gala the Golden Py@@ ramid of Sport .
it does not lack the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ ra@@ vine , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner of the sport pyramid is long .
in Aachen , on Saturday , he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements but also for social engagement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been fo@@ stering offspring for decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the founder Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ ball of Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the price of the Lav@@ azza was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and S@@ ling@@ backs Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are not at all about tax and energy policy , as well as in a basic question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamentally philosophical distinction .
this , on the role of the State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep this small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate to death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , asser@@ ts Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely return regul@@ ators , and he is committed to a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , states : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich are being increased , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
that must be invested , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost equ@@ als .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government @-@ critical wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump , party @-@ internal discussions could also come .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more significant .
tr@@ ump plans to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive back coal mining in the USA .
oil extraction will also be possible in so far protected areas , he wants to announce the Paris Climate Protection Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to explicitly extend the renewable energy with its investment program and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ ed trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time , however , both the US do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , Clinton calls for .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation wages .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump does in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ushed , then he says that he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump confron@@ ts the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics point out that the budget deficit would only be larger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fled woman experiences sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Executive Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as hope @-@ makers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the flight out@@ weigh : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many are secretly ste@@ aling it because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have had experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ ours , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , that tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever believes that when they arrive in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even here , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior or ab@@ used in the worst case .
this leads to the fact that around 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , she appreci@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodations are needed for them , challenges B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
some with no answer to the question of whether or not they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction .
in Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia only fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or their own houses in some common shel@@ ters or their own homes only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central properties exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be lod@@ ged separately by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are har@@ n@@ essed separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is lacking or men and women are gathered together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is available in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read from the crowd that is waiting for the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance Doc@@ tors Stri@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : demands for new work combat measures &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deputy doctors have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work campaign measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work for action starting at the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that ministers had ab@@ used ministers to deal with the concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistance and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members released on Thursday evening on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; had problems , which led to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and solic@@ it official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today filed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labour campaign measures which began at the beginning of September .
the con@@ ten@@ tions led to the fact that this year assistance in@@ mates struck six times , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A assistance physicians , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident physicians and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for physicians in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite player in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be narrow@@ ly and radiant , even for his restra@@ ined conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan on the other hand spoke repeatedly about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper compla@@ ined that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything worse .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten anything .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at that time was burning .
Putin den@@ ounced him and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia .
the offen@@ se was even greater , as it was done by an alleged friend .
to rebuild the c@@ ous@@ ins becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , state @-@ controlled media launched a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
the serious accus@@ ations led by senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are clearly obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after spending the last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the State TV projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were again allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ da@@ sti described it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West , as it looks at its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won in Ankara with certainty that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep fear of regime changes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the summit in this splendid palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that are viol@@ ated and treated badly by the West and are now al@@ lied .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposing sides .
it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents stated at the press conference that they would not even have stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State should at least speak with one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available to Scotland customers
according to the CEO , the R@@ BS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sing and rescu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at this time brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end @-@ users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , decentr@@ alized head@@ quarter and stock exchange listing are to change to Nat@@ West .
Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customer business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand as well as to the brand under which our employees will be busy as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
now I say that we don &apos;t pursue global goals , but local targets .
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customer among these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to become a bank of the brands , for how do we focus internally ( we have asked ourselves ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; said the Chief of the Board .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which was trained by John Gos@@ den on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey to reach the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who before won at G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori quit his che@@ ers when he clin@@ ched victory at Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ ter had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career perspectives
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone which few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it &apos;s his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , which differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enth@@ r@@ alled fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6.000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and Grand @-@ tur@@ ni@@ r jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has been ri@@ dden almost 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
flying from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the UK flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a number of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Seven , 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a ban on drugs .
three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and return to his best form .
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin fire Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly fired his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s close trust for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed special en@@ voy for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that without stating reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s was ordered by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been the deputy since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born 1972 in Tall@@ inn , Est@@ onian capital , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it means ( in Russian ) that he was later a log chief and chief of staff of the staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it &apos;s the main task of the government to support your activity as head of state on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow a mystery .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ d@@ ants Vladimir Putin for a long time and works like he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ns at his own request .
but despite the smile on the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a sort of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president , suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; it is true that I asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - exhau@@ sting posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin a former member of the State Security Service ( K@@ GB ) .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin reached the power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted most .
it was believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as Putin &apos;s third term would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally taken by Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination of the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced their termination in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al on Thursday .
on set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details such as Gib@@ son &apos;s character from the series that follows a team of FBI agents will probably be released at a later date , according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season will be scheduled for 28 September .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a villa@@ ger called for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be about 75 f@@ ishings for sandals that were picked out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives approximately 500m from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ on Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the project is to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of the Que@@ ens@@ wear cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ a@@ duct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 be@@ vel ropes .
the project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ wear cross@@ ings .
we are all witn@@ essing an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge decks at their place and the last section of the deck now get a concrete finish in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this fantastic project , the closure is the trend@@ setting high @-@ rise and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck in the extension , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or south side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3 % .
as the toler@@ ances on which the team worked , they were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being thrown off fishing boats before fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men strug@@ gled to swim in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat rotating around us and introduced us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we left to water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boot @-@ engine had an emergency stop , it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man stab@@ bed to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police informed yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcohol @-@ alcohol perpetr@@ ator cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he twice stab@@ bed her to her .
the 44 year old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 year old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
this triggered the alarm of his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companions .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life partner .
when the two women re @-@ entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds good @-@ value apartments from Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : in the future , investors should be taken much more seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 inexpensive apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a provision is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can also be built on stock .
the big point in the town hall , however , is that Brat@@ mann says : &quot; how can we deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that Brat@@ mann says : &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make as few rules as possible for investors .
the left wants even harder supports for investors .
no matter how viol@@ a , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is growing .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which were to be built anyway .
but how can we offset the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 affordable housing , whose extraction will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , according to plan spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , current bonds should now be bought from the city .
in addition , we would have to think about getting apartments back to the price .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
because in the west town Fri@@ sts are running out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again , the aim of so @-@ called mixing is to be removed .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged people in just a few parts of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be in the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
teenagers and children can no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been compla@@ ined by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones .
so it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest decreased slightly prior to the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon based on a GPS and , once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the ma@@ iden and jumped for the search of the sofa .
in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in incre@@ ments that the &quot; average &quot; person puts back every day .
cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of pursued people who train every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance .
many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to take &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to come &quot; from the sofa &quot; and &quot; being active every day &quot; met deaf ears because many public messages for health are boring and come from people looking miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they enjoy .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine plus fun .
some people even close friends on hunting .
as always , there are lac@@ ri@@ rical gam@@ eb@@ ies that always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even though smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
however , because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , helping many people hunt more actively , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ur@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breath taking on the ground .
brilliant on the whole line .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast drow@@ ned the title of the campaign on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American woman Sim@@ one Bil@@ es will draw on the ho@@ vering bar during the solo campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ le is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American who wins a competition title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport of the last three years , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescu@@ on from her said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awaited her last examination in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between cheap and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the Spring , Texas family would be considered a disappointment .
the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in a single campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ al took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell celebrations of retired man @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clam@@ ation mark .
although Bil@@ al insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during their long absence , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - including their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost a competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ ina was slightly led by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
bri@@ m beams and ground floor - in which Bil@@ le holds the world title - lou@@ der .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the suspended bri@@ m - and sat on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her grand@@ ness - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on fine red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collective book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , called &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Boden@@ worsen@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she threw away the audience from the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in series mur@@ der@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while chat@@ ting in the car and listening to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ gun while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , because the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said the sho@@ ot@@ ings led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were linked to four previous attacks .
a total of seven people were killed and two more injured in His@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months in nine attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincol@@ n .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which aimed at an empty Pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball out of the seat as well as ball fragments out of the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his anti@@ quity , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has insi@@ sted on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to run with the help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund conceived for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please tell me something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund invented several characters on his own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a number of causes : genetic like in Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the zi@@ ca@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Spi@@ ka@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
I haven &apos;t been wondering about the pro@@ g@@ nosis since a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect anyone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful suggestion for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ ca@@ virus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
severe ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives cause to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to call on the emergency stand on Friday . it is expected to have more rainf@@ alls all Saturday .
numerous rivers in the south east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded their banks and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards told that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , said that the requests for floods , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had claimed tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service allowed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels after the weekend .
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream in@@ undation in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as it will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the tro@@ dden rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , arrived on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded .
rescue teams still got people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ ver on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and f@@ lowed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years where she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ be , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said the floo@@ ding had &quot; spread quickly , &quot; as there were still severe rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the rain has been considerably out@@ weighed due to rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities reported that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and L@@ ess@@ on in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the WW@@ F C@@ BS subsidiary reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa caused 200 pre @-@ flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , both flooded .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were r@@ ins@@ ed by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported in@@ und@@ ated on Thursday , but no reports were reported on Friday .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; smoked by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police reported that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a six @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot bre@@ aches , including in the loin , leg , arm , and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , approached the crime scene .
it seems that this was a matter of an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were sleeves .
it seems that several armed comb@@ at@@ ants were involved here , who were actively involved , &quot; said police officer Anthony G@@ inal@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she is re@@ covering and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I set up at the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ning and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I &apos;ve been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who had an inspiring effect on many young girls from other skin colours .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally mirr@@ oring the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one of the female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America rejo@@ iced .
now the world has been able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , but master@@ ful gy@@ na@@ ecological routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this kind of sport , but so do gym@@ n@@ astic classes throughout the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gym@@ na@@ sts first and foremost in private gym@@ n@@ astic associations which are maintained by parents who pay for the training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily .
the majority of these trainers are in prosper@@ ous suburbs to support the business .
in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained their athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics .
we have to provide the communities with inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access gym training .
I founded my gym@@ nasi@@ um of 20 years ago .
in my events , we have offered free and affordable prices in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high quality gymnas@@ tics to the young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this fantastic Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks to Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you , so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance Doc@@ tors would like to organize more strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 resident physicians voted in favour of a vote refused .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans to forci@@ bly introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and would be harmful for the staff and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first resident physicians will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the maintenance of the watch times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistant Doc@@ tors reported last night in a message stating : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance doctors have taken serious concerns on the proposed treaty , in particular that it will heat up the current occup@@ ancy crisis and admini@@ ster it properly to address all the doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time is running out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by argu@@ ing have met with the government for reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes in de@@ af@@ ening silence .
it was one of the promises that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made over the last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift the vibration and address the concerns of the resident physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the Assistant Doc@@ tors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out additional work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors at the stri@@ ker chain .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
BM@@ A would like to offer a better weekend compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 resident physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance physicians to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work campaign measures do not achieve anything but put strain on teams and service providers already over@@ bur@@ dened and prepare patients , nur@@ ses and their families with only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we have spoken to the Advisory Committee of the Assistant Doc@@ tors and have responded positively to the concerns regarding the guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ stle b@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional time to training , mutual recognition of the curriculum , education holidays and the Ministry of Health regarding compl@@ ying with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medicine is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
N@@ ICE &apos;s N@@ ICE regulator has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE &apos;s N@@ ICE regulator has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people each year suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls which form layers .
when the base breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that c@@ aches the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more impro@@ b@@ able .
N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered heart attacks have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
thanks to a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture revi@@ ves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year due to corruption coming from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities how a devastating government report today revealed .
Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , acc@@ esses the police , election observers and Rath@@ enh@@ ouses for ignor@@ ing evidence of abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Minister of Integration and the municipal government , who is now a slave @-@ king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of election boo@@ ths to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should have an identification card to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er must only name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger when they leave their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial betra@@ yal culture that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral sc@@ andal in the east of London .
last year , a special selection court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of cor@@ rupted and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; His campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding sp@@ outs to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... State institutions ignor@@ antly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sensi@@ tivities regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric outlined 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit mail@@ boxes to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has delivered her voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for an automatic letter selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban on political activists to edit complete wall@@ ets and envel@@ opes from local elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have the authority to set up barriers for election stations .
a change of law facilit@@ ating an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation by the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entative Act 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in poll@@ s .
requirement that only English can be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the workers enforce the rule that voters are entering the bal@@ lot box by themselves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no criminal complaint . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared l@@ ut@@ to Rah@@ man and his deputy to be un@@ fit for corruption and illegal practices due to a lit@@ any . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ down controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Rathgeber &apos;s electoral registration departments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous double @-@ ge@@ ese of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio this week have come across the French bicycle rac@@ er Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proved to be an impressive dual predecessor of Cambridge &apos;s Du@@ chess .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic athlete is by far not the only athlete to have gold fighting athlete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one should believe the social media faith .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , on the left , has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
apart from Kate &apos;s double @-@ foot@@ er on the racing track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street star in a sc@@ ary way .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not see any simil@@ arity , except the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I guess that is a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point : the re@@ aring simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes will be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American vo@@ cal@@ ist Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another persistent comparison was drawn between tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who shows similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ v shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face and face .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which shows her own beautiful , wide smile similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis of the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m free style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron emp@@ tied spectators of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ischen games on Wednesday
Canadian television station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; went down , &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he had to leave his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m open @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; color , &quot; one could say : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as he called M@@ ief , he died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ es the C@@ BC comment@@ ator say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Schwi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not capit@@ ulate that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai @-@ Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old chin@@ ese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard , in which many put him at his address
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s commentary and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in people responding to Twitter via Twitter
the comment@@ ator Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and published a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was allowed to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said is very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by stating that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was referring to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not to her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman with@@ drew their clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
in order to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed her how she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf .
she went on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ garments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rose again and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own trousers and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , pulled herself off and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had tasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how contradictory to think that someone would take home pants that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the staff tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and left her and she wasn &apos;t washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were drawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself from weapon attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach yourself from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your predat@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you approach yourself from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get out of the firing line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then beat it with your knee in the gro@@ in and twist the weapon out of his hands while the attack@@ er is comb@@ ating from pain . hit him with the run and move backwards while holding the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , seize the weapon and twist it , so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
store at the same time the weight on the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its handle before moving backwards and pointing the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y it is best to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a gu@@ ide@@ book his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and th@@ row@@ er of a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k switched his course on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before leaving each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought of removing the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be totally re@@ pul@@ sive but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey across Europe Mr W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
from public rail to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task put his immune system definitely under a rehear@@ sal
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample scre@@ ed showed a lumin@@ ometric number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after her lumin@@ omet@@ ry figure of more than 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the worst thing I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I &apos;m not going to lick here because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os Senior Vice President for Snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we caused crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let us call Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had to lick him , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to dock them and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these fil@@ thy goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 84 percent of all lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of gastro@@ intestinal and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their homes after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a damage amoun@@ ting to £ 50,000 because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ on and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ vis@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , the owners of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had pla@@ stered holes , wooden boards were torn open , rub@@ b@@ ish was spread on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for housing management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment could no longer be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , as this property is likely to be considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror inflic@@ ted by the family , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ fe and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances , old garbage was found
in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn open
neighbours said they had to face it on the street and police had to call the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ ated her and her partner this week by force after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ me was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t bother anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived for 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it would have ab@@ used the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ grown site of the Municipal House tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the r@@ enter agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a dele@@ tion is always the final step taken into account of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information they have provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the dele@@ tion on the floor .
workers from the house administration now have to evacu@@ ate garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police passed a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by was given a fine after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial for@@ bear@@ ance .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who was killed in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will deleg@@ ate tenants who do not comply with the house rules
Angela C@@ row of the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed that the dele@@ tion was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal in panic after a flying military jet flies to the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of air forces placed an incredible crash
the air forces admitted that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety risk .
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless jet crashes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they started understand@@ ably to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ e@@ rieb@@ stein , without first seeing what came through the clouds on them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today stated that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby surface fires , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk .
land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people died on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which restric@@ ts his vision .
the airplane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step towards the first title win in the new football season .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup towards FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash is rising three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inner must ren@@ ounce the champion of forces with the defeated cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing European league champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who will compete in the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
he also lacks Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the first question at Bar@@ ca was clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo at least for the time being .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been competing for status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from making a clear decision so far and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the remaining Candi@@ dates res@@ ig@@ ns .
before the first mandatory game of the new season there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool to 0 : 4 .
also at the 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid to di@@ gest and asp@@ ire to the second triumph at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in its own league to ping @-@ p@@ ong gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; title defender &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) .
the World Cup first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and the Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ th@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title together .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would catch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no c@@ aches with them .
they pulled back on the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ é@@ g@@ és on one another in fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches up to here for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists with the China flag posed .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he determined the speed on the plate and left Z@@ hang as there were only a total of 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
nevertheless , there were still plenty of breathtaking ballo@@ ons to be seen .
Mi@@ di@@ ani won the bronze game against the 40 year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ Russian had contracted a ri@@ b injury , after that he was in medical care , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle with tin .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become an Olympic champion in similar high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump sums up &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now weaknesses of his election campaign in U@@ tah &apos;s Republi@@ can strongh@@ old .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed such concerns as concerns expressed by correspon@@ dents .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the battle for the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , before evangel@@ ical Christians , whom he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt was false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media sm@@ iles .
repub@@ li@@ can strongh@@ olds are shaking
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ l from June , Tr@@ ump and his competitor were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not with the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as to how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if at the end for him , for reasons of political correctness , it would not be enough , be al@@ right , &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump Party is said to have threatened to strike funds to support its election campaign , it should not be able to present better results .
instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans will attack the Congress more strongly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Olympics : three &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in dop@@ ing test &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
Ken@@ y@@ as athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee voted to immediately set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported by the team leader K@@ eni@@ as of the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
the IA@@ AF World Federation has investigated the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokesperson said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er , released and signed the rehear@@ sal , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing &apos;s World Cup @-@ fourth in 2015 over 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan doctor of athle@@ tics Michael Rot@@ ich was dra@@ fted by the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed the athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
in the IO@@ C , Kenya has been under special observation after numerous dop@@ ing contracts for a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya benefited from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of television reports , alle@@ gations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing means are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar study in Kenya as he had employed them in the Russian athle@@ tics industry .
it has been proven that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically supp@@ ressed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Salzburger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece .
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary a childhood dream .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with pride in her car@@ ess with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says in her song : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is clever , of course , na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with it .
it is an enormous human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly topical : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same issues , and today they are as meaningful as they were at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
according to reports in Syria , Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year , died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family heard about her death some weeks ago in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the Group in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday .
sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then to a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain the candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of an electoral victory in Gar@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Pres@@ i@@ dency candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expected from Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d said later that he hadn &apos;t talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he would spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clin@@ tons Team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court of the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Republi@@ can block@@ aded the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can Pres@@ i@@ dency candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants neck calendar for &quot; Women and for Men &quot;
Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to publish a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people they would like to find the next generation of models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Kal@@ endar for 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine distinguishes from Old@@ school Play@@ boys as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play@@ boy for men &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , he believes that the calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the portra@@ yal of timeless and classical hair@@ lessness where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the release of the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and praise Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kur@@ d municipality of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of asylum seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term , with some hundreds of thousands of prot@@ ectors from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already sur@@ passed Kurdish strongh@@ olds with criminal charges a few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were on the run in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the defeated coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start re@@ pressing in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that takes up refugees themselves , in their own country refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association depl@@ ored the targeted res@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Ala@@ wit@@ e cities .
that means that Erdo@@ gan may increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the German government to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s Cri@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len pendant destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mi@@ cians the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever adap@@ ts himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the Kem@@ alist and Sä@@ kul@@ tz@@ ar , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as reported by the paper , calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks set up the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , this amounted to 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey are not those of war , poverty or lack of prospects .
the right to asylum in accordance with the Basic Law is exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually pursued .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia may not vote on the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood .
2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for more stup@@ idity than hitherto it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who want to be convinced by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not natives , so you can &apos;t choose the land day .
there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on the end of votes , only lab@@ ori@@ ously apply .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has yet to pass an election campaign just close to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly new@@ bie Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end co@@ ali@@ tion @-@ du@@ sty .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distributing roses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as his legendary former predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel is bl@@ aming for the blo@@ om of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its top candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced what it is like to make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time .
she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale talks twice ; Merkel federal elections are located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Sax@@ onia than the Mecklenburg and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it too regre@@ ts nobody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual campaign conditions on market@@ places and in front of shopping centres with suns@@ ha@@ des and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that means co@@ king , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country you have to brush the ground@@ water so that it is very hard to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any left in the sides of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the advice of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner co@@ king for his co @-@ workers is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats last reached 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election in 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party , with seven percent in poll@@ s , is likely to make the leap into parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the need of vacation and transfer their electoral campaigns largely into the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise green suff@@ ra@@ cists go on trail search for local vocal ch@@ ords among the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , wa@@ ving straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it still beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election vac@@ ations in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and ending at about 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there is always praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff tells of the jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super @-@ team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site was scheduled to be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready .
the opposite will also be given to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up accommodation .
since the construction site has mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the closure of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg continues , the traffic situation within the place has eased .
the citizens can now drive on both sides by O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the ev@@ asive movement through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some serious complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment .
the residents of Bach@@ hof@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the sig@@ nage .
what led to the fact that some trucks were hiding in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the congregation joined forces to ampli@@ fy the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable exc@@ esses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have already been bitten two to three per minute .
the Fast@@ est was on the road at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
but since the construction site has moved on , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg , the street is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales breaks with them leaves every one you ask .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has little consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most popular are the bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him but all the restaurants have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil are missing .
we must be happy about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue is based on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road refurb@@ ishment has thrown off its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his associates .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President @-@ President Jörg Schmidt , on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , asked if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from refurb@@ ishment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much was handled .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
it can be understood that other regular guests are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic guidance .
if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also very nice somewhere else .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family @-@ list returns to the end of the re@@ development work .
in spite of the crises with BSE and a bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on his customers for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s brutal .
laws are constantly being scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what does it have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the conci@@ li@@ atory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all of his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t persu@@ ade anyone .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior , he was on the basis of results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has brought a little time to pass before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some have already been announced , announced , filed : that a new security agency should take care of the attacks of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and arms law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère leaves a second run for proposals that have not been made with the SPD : he wants to raise sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts out of the German passport with dual citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , he thinks this is reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that doesn &apos;t have any chances with the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have in themselves : it plans fast methods for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees that are targeted to the country should check their smartphones in advance and reveal social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of D@@ ul@@ ings for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to obsc@@ ure their identity .
some of these are politically and legally sacred .
some of them still seem ou@@ tri@@ ght and leaves issues open .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks from Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about security in view of the high number of refugees .
and things that people were deeply concerned were not cl@@ inging to election campaign times either .
the inner security has moved enormously .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
the European Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly taking a position on the issue of inner security .
in the past few days there was a great deal between the two parties .
only a violent argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some of the Interior Minister , in which the department heads also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he thinks nothing of a return from the double pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we called for a temporary discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ plen@@ ish it , do not make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitutional and whether it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot inside what could cause stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is also trying to profile itself in the issue of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first cau@@ ti@@ ously sign@@ alizes the willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen still got off lightly .
despite diesel engines , delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it does not run smoothly in all markets .
in the recall action , there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen starts cau@@ tious in the second half of the year in the event of deliveries .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July the VW @-@ based brand weak@@ ens above all in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the total sales , as announced by the company in Da@@ x .
in July , the VW brand sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide to 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
deliveries increased by almost one sixth in the home market Germany .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of sales , led the weaker figures from July , above all , to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there was a reluct@@ ance to buy in some core markets through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , a minus is also to be found .
the Chinese market is a major support for VW .
all in all , the princip@@ ally affected brand of the Nieder@@ sachsen brand continues to get off lightly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an export minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is recorded .
from January to July , group sales leader Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales increase .
at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ating exhaust gas tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling some 2.5 million vehicles to be converted into the workshops .
in the course of the re@@ armament , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars had no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer fores@@ ees a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate for the customer after ref@@ itting , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as was stated on Friday in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now granting its German customers a guarantee for re@@ configured diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have been confirmed last Monday by VW Repres@@ ent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not deterior@@ ate after ref@@ itting , and that all typical vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was stated in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen clearly sees the possibility that for example , customers come into a workshop for half a year after conversion , for example - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even when it comes to customer interest it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal has resulted in uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was stated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see now demands pen@@ al interest from rich savers in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and does not see in it a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not have to worry about paying pun@@ ishments for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as of September , Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund will charge this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on sight deposit or daily cash accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 euros in the future will cost 400 euros per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he kept 40 million euros for some time , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and generate 0.@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bank Chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million Euro 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , the cost is now further reduced .
to leave the cash in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be far too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bayern pronounced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not economically viable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bench @-@ Fili@@ ale 2014 made head@@ lines with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay the fees for deposits , for this the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is more lav@@ ish with wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if they guard for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
famous actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; currently no other banks are known to the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which charge a substitute for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold of going into neg@@ atives vis @-@ à @-@ vis private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be able to accept this in terms of breadth .
destination Records : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged loving plates .
before you rush to the comments section , in order to sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ iter@@ ate men &apos;s middle age with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ birth of vinyl records is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Mid@@ life @-@ No@@ stal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght , between 45 and 54 .
indeed , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group .
it is also not hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers prefer their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest grey suit and gra@@ zing wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and say something better than : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though Soh@@ o &apos;s heart is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers are located - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such businesses and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I wonder ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4000 records .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dressed the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and buy objects he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably were a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records tend to be intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy back their old records .
from the conversations I led , people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would explain the boom to followers of the record revision of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received an impetus on the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound plate sleeves , of objects that wake up happy youth memories .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a sort of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is the case with me as a collector so I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an employee of a panel stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not own record players .
at that time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I smoo@@ then through a stack of bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just came in here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead gram@@ ophone record so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ consuming , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts newest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ t@@ packed Pop instead of experimental jazz conc@@ iles from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but serious mental trauma is hard to det@@ ectable if one stands beside someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ shopping as a big shopping .
it does not deserve much , therefore collecting plates is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she drives off with a de@@ ar@@ ted si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I &apos;m preten@@ ding to have a pair of jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers might send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most for luxury objects such as plates .
even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are correct , they don &apos;t take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with the b@@ um@@ ming through record shops of the Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets by records , while they steer clear of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French court re@@ jects offer of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional businesses , in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , sell hair@@ dres@@ sers or buy tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said the food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the rain was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp which is operated by a community and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum items for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to keep the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants were estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the Jung@@ le camp increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance in the Olympic timer , cycling prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep watching the World Cup , remain confident and cont@@ erc@@ ise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has no explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s driving , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in peace what reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the World Championship in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed over the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , new lightning devices will be tested , which should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic appearing reinforcement tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident areas , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , at highway construction sites or to clean bridges with temporary speed limit , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that there is a steady speed limit for compliance with the speed limit .
but a permanent mobile construction may be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days in un@@ interrupted measurement mode , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as passage prohi@@ bitions after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , according to the manufacturer , the trailer can be connected with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
so that it is not simply st@@ owed away , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also van@@ ish @-@ safe outer cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested and used by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France ordered 100 units to be ordered , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class wins gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is in the final on Thursday evening , when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ stit@@ ching , back @-@ up , line and ro@@ her strength to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation price of the silver medal - Great Britain fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the obvious defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it could be a comfort for GB - but it is not likely that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England of Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , she lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they only lost one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and pushed the attacks of G@@ Bs for fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell an and Co . , as if you were running into driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au turned off in the corner .
with only four minutes of playing time Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB has hardly touched the ball .
a tight T@@ ack@@ le by Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , Y@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a points out a Touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the second kick and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ides by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while still learning the UK .
this is how it is .
GB introduced basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was running through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an experiment for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the southern sailors whose fans sang , flags wa@@ ved and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and GB ki@@ cked down cr@@ ush@@ ingly in the law@@ ns .
earlier this day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant , late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by combat with the coach &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that will mean something .
from the first strokes to the last 220 hard p@@ ieve that go into history Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ ations found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was present at the moment when she joined the second Olympics in a second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports , which made such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 3@@ 9th non @-@ beaten work , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female ath@@ lets gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of triumph@@ al go@@ ose .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and nobody was more instrumental than the coach who didn &apos;t know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer at all .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that was operated and that was what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads out everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if this is the right term at all .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing to itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ riding morning doing something more than anything else , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , which was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much that means to me , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be anyone , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked a better person for coaching or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close up , p@@ anning and glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very trapped at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency procedures on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an outstanding event , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) and the re@@ purchase of water pipes .
there have been no stand@@ still and there have always been innovations , because water is the most important food@@ stuff and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and proper service for over 31 years .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association , as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ keeper and he was a faithful companion .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view , he described the construction of well and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the rup@@ ture at the elevated tank at the church lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so that the towns could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water sports association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other concerned parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed she had to die .
but the now eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago was well forward and now ler@@ ne privately in New York where there are the best therapists .
&quot; to give an example : when I ask him something which lies two years ago when I sang at La Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; Net@@ reb@@ ko said .
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the bass bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .
she is now married to the tenor Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship Ad@@ dress in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man Sh@@ oot at Risk of Life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at his partner in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n County ) and mort@@ ally wounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself to us and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him become public .
now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown burnt and has a bald .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
in the meantime , the man has a bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , such as the police .
who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police are talking about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the police in Lü@@ beck initially did not want to provide information about the Ta@@ vern or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but it confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a murder crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of crime .
steel - German steel industry view
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity production are from the table .
it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Survey at the existing facilities for so @-@ called self @-@ flow production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations tough after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works fall into an EEG @-@ envelope of 20 percent .
but even this is not obj@@ ected in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely as@@ cer@@ tained .
particular importance has been given to the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a significant price pressure .
last year , the situation worsen@@ ed when the world &apos;s largest producer country , China , faced massive steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers acc@@ use Chinese steel companies price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , the import duties imposed on import steel show effect ; on the other hand , economic prospects in China have spread .
it is not clear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have been stagn@@ ating .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
finally , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel producers are cau@@ tious .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Economic Association Steel announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been by two percent below the prior @-@ year figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all his life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt @-@ Studium , she occupied the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall livel@@ ier , she says .
by the way , she does something good about her health and spirit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most sen@@ iors are singing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and nur@@ ture social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp made this experience in her choir : &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
because of this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of the pu@@ ste in everyday life as well .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
in older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Sen@@ iors Organis@@ ations .
in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens a lot of memories , often combined with positive feelings of her adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ denied people dec@@ eive themselves on long @-@ rec@@ alled events .
in singing , a special performance is demanded for the head , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone do not only focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced by singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise something for a long time , I will be better and wa@@ xed more than myself - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start singing are enough .
if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - for 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound comes next ?
looking for the right offer , Sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces sings in a senior choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who would like to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react sensi@@ tively as tom@@ cats to scre@@ ams of k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hannover , what effect the rowing of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ ch@@ ew also did not let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the level of arous@@ al of cat bur@@ ies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , such as scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Hanover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males react also to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance for the males , &quot; said bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams differs with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
altogether nine adult males and eight female males were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a pack of small ones , taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no offspring yet , responded distinc@@ tly to the cries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned around faster to the loudspeaker , when this ru@@ ffle was played by the more excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be either heredi@@ tary or develop@@ ped with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males did not react at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noises in humans .
also , some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski gra@@ bs with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
in front of the Du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between the Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual . &quot;
the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be affected by the suspension of the state of emergency after the crash test in July .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len responsible for the coup attempt .
it will not stop even before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
according to this , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kü@@ r is said to be supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
it is true that the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact it has no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country , Erdo@@ gan declared on Wednesday for an end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the &quot; Bes@@ ic@@ ta &quot; workers &quot; club are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what the Turks unite in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ts .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ic@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will arrive especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne Cathedral proved its sporty value in the past season : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the top sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the round @-@ out kno@@ ck@@ out in the Champions League , the &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; leave early in the Europa League .
in the South per Li@@ g it was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ic@@ ta , the year of the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who provided the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasons of the season as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the 31 year old .
at the time of the coup attempt at AC Florence , he had announced only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to not return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must say it only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to do this , the stri@@ ker would have to be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his estimated annual rate of 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man made it clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als at Olympia in Rio
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin , 34 year old , was already twice locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio to med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing still remains the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who after a dop@@ ing block compla@@ ined about her start right before the games , was mar@@ shy and ki@@ cked out at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : with a set smile she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was fixed that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a jam @-@ storm .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who start the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he has been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its ban , the 2004 Olympic champion and ex @-@ world champion has been running even faster than before , he is over 100 metres in 9,@@ 80 seconds number one in the world and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to reti@@ re in 2010 after taking the pain@@ killer Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European championships , was tested positive for the banned stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic rebu@@ ked the scientific in@@ takes and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and closed 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible , eu@@ ph@@ oria entered .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is more than 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ sti@@ el , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete has been awarded many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having been determined by testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had also had to release the 2004 Olympics because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the Euro title in 2006 for testosterone mis@@ use .
the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games was rejected by the International Sports Tribunal for the CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record physician and gold favorite was tested positive only in May but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , clu@@ es were found on taking a forbidden supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered from wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but had already left it .
she planned her journey home at the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as rub@@ b@@ ish .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sions went up again , and a further person was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
during the det@@ on@@ ation close to the popular beach resort Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police instructions .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the he@@ el was blown up in a flower bed in front of the re@@ vier of the coast police .
finally , there were several injured det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ western coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the Sou@@ theast Coast several injured .
from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ eth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect it to be a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to manifest itself to possible motives - probably it is a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize in the attacks a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs have been placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
in recent days , the authorities have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and places .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce the security of important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely smaller bomb attacks , but mostly they are not directed against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between the security forces and the Muslim populations , there will be no need to travel to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta CEO and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability , improving economic conditions and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , resist@@ s itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
over 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t assault of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several offices , the constitutional guards in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see indications of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional executive Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist fashion .
this is why we are now observing the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ tur@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional guards in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - are already observing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that his authority was closely aligned with the offices in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Vice President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak to them with a more you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as legal extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a solic@@ ited advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
last but not least , reports on contacts of the &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; to Af@@ D politicians had been reported from several federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
possible contacts of this type are only relevant for the constitutional protection only at a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - changes its target direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , and becomes extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not identi@@ fiable .
with a view to the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation , Ma@@ he said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have found that there can be a right @-@ wing terrorist structure .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it can be quite clear that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or groups of small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee trage@@ dies or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed his concern that many offen@@ ders went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying factor .
many of the susp@@ ects in case of attacks on asylum accommodations have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that have never been associated with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example , CD@@ U , the SPD or the Left , who , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic games and world records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the margin@@ ally important s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia swa@@ m so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently turned into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his course with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and reserved the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
because most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , I just wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the rounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ ub@@ les of the whale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; referring to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English bou@@ levard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ metre @-@ free style , played no part .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to travel alone over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle on his own .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the lo@@ oming electoral defeat so narrow
Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
should there be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative video .
then he will go on holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately it will either fold or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the U.S. television transmitter CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if at the end it would not be enough for him for political correctness , be it fine , &quot; Tr@@ ump said .
he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
in the end , more and more resistance was formed within his party .
post is moving into trading with electric v@@ ans
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter also .
the Group will soon start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post wants to offer its electric vehicles also on the free car market in the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they will be delivered to their own developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to sell to other establishments .
post @-@ executive Ju@@ er@@ gen Ger@@ des had said that there are always some questions , such as tra@@ des@@ men .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will soon enter the mass production of the vehicles .
in the post @-@ factory fabri@@ cation , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete shift to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we outline the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership decreases after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges the head of Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K has indicated that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will become even more uncertain as the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : following again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the world &apos;s number five is facing a new start in personnel .
GF@@ RP chief executive wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect on 12 September .
as early as September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board takes over the former board member Gerhard Haus@@ geräte , informed the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy orientation as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company spokes@@ man did not want to mention details on Friday .
who will lead the market research company in the future , is still unclear .
in An@@ ger circles it was said on Friday , at the shareholders the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures initiated years ago had been great .
Hart@@ mann has been at the top of the Gf@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recent bad Gf@@ K business figures , any shareholder will eventually become uns@@ atis@@ fied at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this were the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop its loss journey in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable period of the previous year .
in response to the first half of the year , sales declined by 3.4 per cent to EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1,2 million .
earnings in the second quarter were primarily imp@@ acted by the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the Consumer Experience business unit , which had become necessary in the Consumer Experience business area of EUR 139 million , resulted in a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps into a cro@@ ok in dit@@ ch : eight injured
in an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ Hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , informed the police .
according to her specifications , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to give her information to an opposite truck that was partly on the counter @-@ track .
the bus arrived right off the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the passengers .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency medical car came to the accident location on the state road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ Hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ all .
there , they should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amounts to 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ tho@@ ahl , 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros . for the supply of Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.2 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the sewage charge will increase at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a succ@@ essively sleep@@ y calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when the budget was approved by the Council of the Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , under@@ cover was established for these sewage systems .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effectively .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from World Bank , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to dig deeper into the pur@@ se .
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Administr@@ ative Director , Herbert Schmidt explained to the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the se@@ wer systems of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period were also to be compensated .
Schmidt explained that there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack on all three sewage systems , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing .
furthermore , due to their old age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses were incurred in a considerable extent in all three plants , not least due to their age .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for World Bank , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt informed that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in Az@@ endorf sewage plant due to damage .
the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led in the pumping station of the world . after nearly 20 years operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be evacu@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation possibility was installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses incurred the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; fully sm@@ ashed &quot; in the three plants .
according to Schmidt , the market community has remained spar@@ ed from major entertainment costs in the se@@ wer systems over the past 20 years .
according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the mentioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious in the long term , as one cannot expand the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater utility company in order to avoid these facilities because they are defici@@ ent .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first about zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the average annual fl@@ ation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10.@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase was observed in the following groups of consumer goods : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1,7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances , and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained unchanged as in the pre@@ mon@@ ate of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged .
sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian cartoon
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is un@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ un@@ tly , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ carri@@ ages arrive to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when it proposed a filter to a couple of users , who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and che@@ eks , some critics called it rac@@ ist cartoon of Asi@@ ans - &quot; Yellow face . &quot;
they asked themselves whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely spread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended to pay tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely distributed over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fragile and sal@@ eable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian cartoon and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face was drawn into the bot@@ tom@@ ing extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters generates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much harder that such things stay un@@ noticed when it was the case before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that rac@@ ist controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the modelling practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his staff , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a personnel officer focusing on sub@@ divided population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said they would leave their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership of false IS@@ IS intelligence , re@@ jects the Committee of the Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions were permitted on site , an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Members of the Dis@@ ci@@ dent Committee , Secret Service Com@@ mit@@ ee and the Ar@@ med Forces Com@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , in short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence @-@ related information , typically enjoyed by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ de@@ urs , regularly marked a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on site had allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership mistakes in Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows in detail continual problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips have given instructions under Obama to alter the reports , it shows how analysts face the pressure of their superi@@ ors , a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , opinions and statements before Congress were considerably more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ s@@ sul@@ es could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from mid @-@ 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to play down the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports is being carried out by the Ministry of Defense &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; har@@ med the moral under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave excessive little space for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and the democr@@ ats gave no indication of an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts in regard to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who were in@@ gest@@ ed according to complaints made by Cent@@ Com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon press spokesperson , in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the alle@@ gations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a written reference about how the then government under George W. Bush had fores@@ een only a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these temporary refin@@ eries had been commissioned to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Com@@ rade Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel in the Central Command .

both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group from six teams .
the first place will take a little longer to the strong Dutch to guide the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years she had a hockey club in her hands ( her two older sisters were playing sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , became a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental shift and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ space in London that we now have .
we have been able to ro@@ b the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door ri@@ ms in the first half of the game with a back @-@ hand blow from the near area .
India had gone into play without any victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ aped the ball in the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the entire tournament for the US go@@ al@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday &apos;s outcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the Rio de Janeiro events are constant and in@@ escap@@ able , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ band to the swi@@ mmer to the gym@@ n@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s chat in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ aked or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could well be among these well @-@ known names being sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV commerci@@ als if he was a swi@@ mmer , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not highlight any event .
further from the center , some in the shadow are the sports , which are not generally accepted : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it reign long .
but if I should be modest in arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had their debut in Sydney , it was so spar@@ sely noticed the last 16 years that many who asked me did not know that it is an Olympic athlete .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , there has never been a medal in jumping on tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 they had an athlete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal this year from London .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast .
it has a humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending boun@@ cing - but also the gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and pi@@ geon , the two kinds of sports that are essentially united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to official Olympic programme , they are rated according to the design , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts need to go further , faster , up and down in their quest to gold , sometimes to the finish , sometimes down and back , up and down on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the exit wall , but also a further highlight in television transmission : the world or the Olympic cord .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers an resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces down , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly up again .
there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the women &apos;s qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time , which the men on Saturday , also around 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his air rin@@ ding new fan base .
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia greeted the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses testi@@ fied that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police in the event of gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia having just collap@@ sed ?
in the last ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was un@@ merciful .
witnesses stated that police shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos on the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even harder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba capital .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was reduced , with dissi@@ dents effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or sent to prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are supp@@ ressing people and have no other options to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ stat Tes@@ at , a professor in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less in recent years to exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness gradually explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate through social media , since cheaper smartphones are becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies hiding where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians found that they were so close to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from a@@ edi@@ cs mainly to Christian high lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economics as they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this too is changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Z@@ ach@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fair@@ ingly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly interested in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process enemies and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such a tur@@ mo@@ il was 2005 after thousands of prot@@ esters prot@@ ested , according to claims by analysts seemingly fu@@ elled by the government and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal de@@ mis@@ e of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked businesses by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a strange position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently announced that she has closed this basis .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump declares his asser@@ tion Obama was founded by IS@@ IS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to sc@@ atter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by ang@@ ing that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ si@@ bly with the American public .
it also brings along its competitors who endeav@@ our to take it in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the particular position to have explanations that he could not have meant .
having made the suggestion of an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump called back on Thursday and insi@@ sted that he really did not intend to suggest that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was totally serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can candidate wanted nothing of it .
the last storm of criticism pl@@ as@@ sel@@ t down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to declining demand figures .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump again tried to return to this subject .
reporting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already advanced sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction precip@@ it@@ ates . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert observing the language of both candidates .
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of resol@@ ving the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an additional tone because his demand values have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is published on Friday showed a lead with a huge margin in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humour .
but while he is increasingly focusing on the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump sums up his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advoc@@ ates of Tr@@ ump , had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was asked to correct Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organisation , he called them back@@ bro@@ kers , completely false , and that is why it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in the Clinton Clinton as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out by allowing them to take control of the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
prior to the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being on each of his words and pre@@ occupied against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ologies as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once pushed over the market price , Café in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a bad café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only bar , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displaced .
soap Cher@@ ie , sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
indigenous people took it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is changing , it &apos;s also a new invention .
a rev@@ ital@@ ised verb café opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing member of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide money for a new branch , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of attention .
verb uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese on the menu and there are gar@@ ni@@ es such as cap@@ ers and aci@@ dic onions .
there are natural tear@@ drops .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers have also been displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the verb regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the closure had closed , she gave up the coffee t@@ ines for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb which I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended ch@@ ai tea instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the reloc@@ ation in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably always ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal still receives his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he didn &apos;t have a gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business had taken the old business area .
indeed , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for bre@@ wing with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll go into their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has preferred to make them out , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies at Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Water@@ tur@@ tle Sou@@ p .
its menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , local snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered hack@@ sley , this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinners .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first world war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the routes with which the country was going to no longer be the land of Sch@@ lar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e asked why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new diet was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ generating food resi@@ dues , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dry fruits .
meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rarely servi@@ ced luxury .
peculiar mix@@ tures were tried out , as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking .
during her research for the book , which includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this time , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - continued the country &apos;s eating habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household policies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to be able to meet the challenge of converting P@@ amp@@ e as creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ mich @-@ Cake @-@ Food @-@ attitude , are particularly tasty .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farming kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million@@ fold man of the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked a continental kitchen like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to take an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hire of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors made by Mrs Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting ones . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country got back on its legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on cal@@ orie and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to foods .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ ck@@ man remembered , &quot; They really made people sick . &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
after the plates were vac@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pf@@ lau@@ men@@ dessert that ate President Roos@@ ev@@ elt at mid@@ day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , and added that it was a nasty trick to give a modest name to modest recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ vul@@ ged a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a set@@ back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dev@@ ote his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save the lives of others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack on the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil protection group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people alive .
29@@ 00 volunteers attach their own life to the game , to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil protection officer , showing him during a 11 hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbolic figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , but he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die in saving life , I think God will see a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the recent bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters had four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture cited his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back into the sea following an investigation on board the Shi@@ p Shi@@ p .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks will only get up with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates at a full speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal &quot; Science &quot; at least one Greenland shar@@ k , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein comments from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist believed long ago that Greenland &apos;s hair could be st@@ oned .
only the evidence failed .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated areas of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in the winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
their slow motion measured them as they carried out six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
this sh@@ arks still make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
maybe they hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cad@@ aver that tor@@ ment from higher water layers to the bottom .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ i@@ dens , who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re was measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens evol@@ ves before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens @-@ core .
their birth , therefore , was to lie after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons hunt more quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the length of the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the l@@ enti@@ l core contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons experiments , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland ha@@ i@@ dens , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts in their l@@ enti@@ ls , generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length could assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res was probably at the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks with the increase obviously allow at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such Meth@@ us@@ al@@ ites live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland w@@ al , whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on tip was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us flame .
they then ri@@ pen later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources in a long life .
building reason in double pack
the council at the recent meeting focused on topics related to building construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the committee accepted the communication of mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of newly designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , plot and development questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) is no longer possible .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau attract young families and former sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , building will@@ s can register now in the Town Hall , about the awar@@ ding of the par@@ c@@ els , the municipal council is expected to consult in its September meeting .
in order to meet requests for the establishment of additional commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan , which was newly created in the spring of this year , in sub @-@ sections .
in the area of sub @-@ time lar@@ n , the industrial area has been extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
thus , the city on the River Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , admission to the UK has so far been sufficient .
the banks are currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs on the River Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is responsible for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk @-@ based ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg hides a large fund sector , it does not cut off the infrastructure as well as Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
furthermore , the city has easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Seine , rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition with good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer the city was ranked 7th , Luxemburg , No. 19 , Dublin in number 33 and Paris to 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers .
in London according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gets legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. magi@@ strate decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc. .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the infrin@@ gement of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by mer@@ gers , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts .
when charging the suit on Thursday , U.S. Secretary Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead was entitled to reli@@ ance on costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equ@@ ate Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claimed to acc@@ use each other and claim ownership on laboratory work , which included Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
United States supported troops say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left the town , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
according to the extract of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) currently have the city .
they have released over 2,000 civilians held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , Shar@@ on Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons Ear@@ nings 10.@@ 75 Million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton released their tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ ars ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax returns for the past ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind wrong exc@@ uses and rein@@ for@@ cements in reference to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , even though they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his refusal to conduct a tax audit by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons election campaign assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter regarding the publication of the democr@@ ats &quot; presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , special advis@@ er , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax audi@@ ts were not completed .
s@@ ling@@ backs Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal issues with respect to wealth , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business relations and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump calls for his tax return .
on Thursday , she spoke on the subject during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico reported that Tr@@ ump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that people pay the more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka last week , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industri@@ alized con@@ glomer@@ ate has his seat here , called Tr@@ ump to meet their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the elec@@ tors and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons campaign has been released back to 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % .
the 2015 Clin@@ tons tax return showed that only USD 100 of their income was paid as wage , unlike most Americans .
their main money investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues were tax@@ ed from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ powder , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into settlements inhabited by humans - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea for years ago , has intensified its promotion along with the US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is a world telep@@ hon@@ y day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we developed the ... tool@@ kit we could observe a change in attitude within these communities , with much more confidence that they can keep the eleph@@ ants off their fields without damaging the elephant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in one horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chim@@ e cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ree mixed with soil is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition coil .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ powder in the air .
a touch is usually sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option is a th@@ row@@ er who shoots a gold fil@@ let into the air while causing a loud , bright explosion .

however , the proposal for the construction of a new building on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine river currently under construction declined unanim@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally , we welcome new commercial operators , but at this location in an exposed position on the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director hits Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; appeal - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli election as it had claimed Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of Holocaust documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issued his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of countries in the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote lance to Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sent it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the worker was cited by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and dis@@ ma@@ yed .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in precisely this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the Internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ate the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had yiel@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged sum@@ mons of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a Synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel in the quick @-@ election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added .
police op@@ poses tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms to the public education system .
the police took tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disp@@ ose of the students , which led the police to use rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be converted to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional President Michel Tem@@ er spra@@ ying on walls .
the recent protests took place several days after prot@@ esters in crowds went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the commercial turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an , grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent year @-@ on @-@ year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been abol@@ ished , the interest in Russian companies in business in the country grew strongly , the ambassador ass@@ ented .
Russian companies are taking up existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports into Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran increased 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; goes out of a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the Russian foreign representation made about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Nag@@ old : playing and having fun at the summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the Kinder@@ schutz@@ bun@@ des Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer vac@@ ancy in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet surroundings of the hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first week of school holidays .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , we went to B@@ rescue with a visit to the stro@@ king zoo .
on the other side to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion took us to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group experienced a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and planning .
children and car@@ ers with their own cour@@ ty@@ ards , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ger Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese have been culinary .
in workshops , b@@ ati@@ fied , beautiful jewels of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the spare time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot;
on the day of departure , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the eye care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch ( St. Anna ) were on their way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were dealt with together .
in order to bridge the time to the next generation of Rom@@ ish stran@@ ts in two years , the minist@@ erial Round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided on the Bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where in this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , there was a special pilgrimage destination on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , of Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of the rooms of the saints , went their way .
in the evening before , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims at a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage church and shared the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved one , and so the Pil@@ gri@@ m &apos;s Way started from Münster .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is made a break at field cross@@ roads , chap@@ els or churches in order to sing together a song of specially made pilgri@@ m song .
for overnight stays the parish homes of the local parish were available .
at the stage guests Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller have taken care of a tasty and for@@ ti@@ fying dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after , the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , had to be climbed about 500 al@@ timet@@ ers at a mu@@ ggy heat and then climbed up afterwards .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the Pil@@ gri@@ mage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went on the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived in Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a small impulse God was given thanks .
at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the city district .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms at home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last evening in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int at Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 year old from Glasgow took the anchor , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y to E@@ igen . the J@@ PG pro@@ fan@@ ed the legend when he stor@@ med home to bring home a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in London in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a result .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement caused a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Scot@@ sman , which now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner scored an Olympic cord in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
behind his lap was slightly back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow him down and enable Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked up from his position as BBC expert and fell sk@@ inn@@ y , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ds when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the victory in 2012 on Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ y &apos;s side , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he deliberately dropped onto the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a superb victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole Great Britain flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that has won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle .
with the form Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of the possibility that he will repeat Ho@@ y &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in one contest .
that would for Kenn@@ y - who is exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be equal to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometre race .
they arrived at the target in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he argued with officials before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on its strong web @-@ driven team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
dra@@ mas took place in the background , thus the res@@ ignation of the technical manager Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ bbing vor@@ cers , as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its climax at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the abolition of the energy contract in question
the future of the aluminium sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supply contract and thus abol@@ ish all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , not to grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the enam@@ el consumed about 10 percent of the total power generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land will lose money and risk closure .
this step follows the long @-@ term speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and , last , due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium sm@@ elter with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , informed that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; AG@@ L expects the plant to continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt @-@ melt , &quot; said the company .
AG@@ L further said that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which would have come into force in November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the earnings of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual depreci@@ ation of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expecting a termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Al@@ coa that the decision to issue the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as ability ... to operate the melt or to ensure the supply of the enam@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not compromise &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said there was a 20 year contract signed with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which would have come into force from November this year , even though there is still an explanation of why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn because of poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume about 600 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year and around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the female manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coating of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , a critical reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n &apos;s most popular show bi@@ z and producer of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é act almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris forced her other girls to take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes having beaten the vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were looking to see it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference resem@@ bling an illustrated book as a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Acc@@ ording to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover @-@ stars is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine will still oo@@ ze before the official announcement .
women already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Models , the celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the former category , is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true for Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &quot; success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enny &apos;s position in the world of fashion has always been ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ sty pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were boiling up again when the news came out with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but riding around seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made images by C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her spare time she is in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
each year there are 160@@ ,000 people in the community centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 160@@ ,000 of the countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most urgent need &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the country are rejected by the community centres each year , while the industry is facing the impact of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly elderly , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and similar - are rejected by their solic@@ itation for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly util@@ ised , are ready for further reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year it is planned that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l Community Law Centr@@ es said that the last survey of the National Association of Law Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without the abolition of the federal government &apos;s decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically funded , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services that you need , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these mid @-@ cuts so that people can get the help they need for legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for right @-@ wing workers on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign charged after employees alleged weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ ft &apos;s Campa@@ ign was accused of alleged in@@ action after it was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a gun on an employee in February , while she was on a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in a bill of indictment , which was submitted by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i on Wednesday by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i admitted to have been waiting for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realised that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i charged in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ord@@ i stated that at least four more people had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after Republi@@ can candidate dis@@ b@@ anded a ri@@ ot when he said a crowd in North Carolina said that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People - guns and arms fans - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judges should appoint judges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps Campa@@ ign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made it clear that the media tore his words out of context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due di@@ ligence and from Philip for bodily harm and permanent psychological damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ ling@@ backs wasn &apos;t available for a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign .
no response was made to phone calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services .
the Republi@@ can candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far conducted a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of poll@@ s : SPD and CD@@ U lose
during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U are recorded .
this resulted from representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD pl@@ ung@@ ed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was just close to the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent again .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
despite an easy loss of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated again into the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
according to the survey , the SPD of the survey was only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 per cent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they were still lying behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 per cent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return to the pirates , contrary to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator launched the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good either .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would be sufficient for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was launched 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro lovers can buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could set a lot for standards at that time : SMS and emails could be sent and received , also via fax was the communic@@ ator .
even the access to websites was possible via HTML browser , albeit very slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could gu@@ essed in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile phone Division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market is dominated by providers who came a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that is today for very many people &apos;s everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around € 400 billion .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has since been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs on Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator to easily serve everything by touch screen .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al procession began , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the after@@ glow .
they finally van@@ ished , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
today , every German today has a look at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must all learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips for our local communities alone , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too big .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we &apos;ll be flo@@ cking on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ishers were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in wit@@ ty growth and a legacy of skills and jobs both to leave the airport as well as throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
the 2012 London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trading and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies who earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , try to b@@ ypass advertising blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would be ad block@@ ages on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block again advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop page would change coding with respect to its advertising adver@@ ts , to make it difficult to detect the recognition of which part of the page advertising is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blog post the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her conflict between the Open Source Community and the hang@@ ers has been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying advertis@@ ers have become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook &apos;s advertising revenue .
the company refra@@ ins from delivering ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers do not have an impact on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social networking and inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a big share of revenues so Facebook seems to be worthwhile to invest in such a step .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its ad preferences tool to give people more control over their adver@@ ts .
on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block &apos;s new filters were wor@@ rying because they would also block contents on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man on Facebook in an email communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt instrument , which is why we have concentrated on developing tools such as ad preferences to gain more control over people &apos;s hands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman with presum@@ ed suicide to drive on Swiss highway &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was on the highway in the middle of the night .
the police call for witnesses , after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 motorway in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman , at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , who , as well as every witness of the incident , promp@@ ts them to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter told the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that the drivers are not being held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing , after having crossed a man and killed a man lying on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 year old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , taking the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman - who had responded to an emergency call -- drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus through tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine if Venus could have rejected earth @-@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still turned slowly .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protected from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , resem@@ bling the evolution of planets that had previously been suspected of planetary scientists .
although it was presumably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billion years .
her oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro @-@ gen dissip@@ ated only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy jumps back as a trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy coming back on Thursday as trainer and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will seek immediately after a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth than it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the coach &apos;s vision and vice president Of Ho@@ ckey operations must be perfectly matched to those of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ r , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick was informed today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams awards as the best coach of the league .
he took the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell back five points behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , put forth strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour disputes on wages for North Sea oil workers are exposed , while all parties sit down for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold several full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start early next year to address the problems anew .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contracting in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating is followed by a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore customers in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts have given the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dischar@@ ged thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
at the beginning of this week , the Scottish parliament members Dave Anderson met with workers leaders in order to discuss one of the greatest industrial disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared with an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars revol@@ ve around different rates and in which context the rot@@ ational periods are related to planet formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 years of light from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars that originated some 125 million years ago now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rotation rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars stum@@ ble in large amounts of con@@ stell@@ ations .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogn@@ ising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star@@ base -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive stars turn slower than a few massive stars .
ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereas larger stars turn slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still a lot to learn about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball Star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional release announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game Duel@@ ist of the major league bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league three times , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and a youth coach - with a full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 score for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be absorbed in the glory hall of the bas@@ eball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for as successfully Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was on the field , his appearance outside the square is so controversial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted that ster@@ oids were banned between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received funding for an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done me a favor for 2014 , because I &apos;ve played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said swe@@ eter then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball players still get the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relationships with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy @-@ confir@@ m@@ ations of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch @-@ riv@@ al Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2016 Olympics : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a s@@ wis@@ s athlete had almost won a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese Schwi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter steep@@ le runner in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , these messages come to an accident .
in Ch@@ en the di@@ ure@@ tic Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was already demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just by 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the courses over 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and requires full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news filtered through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to be the banned substance for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported his criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men are not pulling the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case called &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested three days previously positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had prohibited the entire Russian squ@@ ad except for systematic dop@@ ing , even the ir@@ res@@ nation Kenya made numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the earlier off@@ ences in China caused violent clas@@ hes also between the athletes .
this is how the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion , Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to commit myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was tested positive for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ mil@@ azi@@ din in 2014 , but only had to sit down for a three month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so Per@@ fi@@ de inv@@ ade hack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail @-@ malware attack companies currently - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey by the malware Ab@@ wehr specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 540 firms in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the goal of ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in company networks .
if they succeed there , the potential to black@@ out ran@@ som is considerably higher than for private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ cy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks took place in the past months in a frigh@@ tening manner .
Ran@@ som@@ ware operates according to a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for im@@ print files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and effectively del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail compressor .
to get the end turn code into the files , the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of the cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users have the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stand@@ still@@ s .
correspon@@ d@@ ingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware falls .
22 per cent of German companies reported losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to inter@@ rupt operations completely , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of acute cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always tell the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ z@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the hack@@ ers , on the other hand , know this and try to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user areas and contact with the black@@ ma@@ sts and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they account for their victims by chat@@ ting how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ code example files for free .
and if private people are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies will have to bar@@ gain hard negotiating and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming more and more professional and share their work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the present malware kits were created by installing malware on themselves , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ers are then looking for more hack@@ ers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you logs in one of the forums in the background , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .

&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ ammer to spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on rep@@ elling Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful deployment , the perpetr@@ ators are instead threatening with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ cy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that , depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators will also be able to completely new goals on the internet of things .
at the de@@ co @-@ conference of Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could gain a thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such blocked heating could certainly be a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work in any place .
the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the upper side of the cockpit is reduced .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l at elevated and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back seat can be folded up like chairs and offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
his work , however , should be somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
another engine is available : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steering , however , should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top version of the top version . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the city emergency braking system ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the ran@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent temporary controller responds to traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tle the speed as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; touch screen , navigation system , app integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI @-@ jack lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore a bit aw@@ k@@ ward to reach .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht ( Ober@@ landes@@ gericht ) of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only if there are dangers which are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff had broken down a knee .
however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of living , so the court .
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of illness : when does the Organ@@ izer pay
ill holi@@ day@@ makers only return money after their trip if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ lessly found in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests reported the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family suffered from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ mo@@ il .
she spent almost all the holiday in the room .
their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective wastewater treatment plant , which allegedly polluted the sea@@ water .
the family believed that the trip was poor - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizer only learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information obligations , so the verdict .
especially as no contam@@ in@@ ants were found in the water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people would have concerns about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and resol@@ ute to react at the same time to terrorist haz@@ ards .
one thing is certain : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we will not treat this triumph to the terrorists .
if the perpetr@@ ators would have to leave the country more quickly , this hei@@ gh@@ tens the security and strength also the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals until the parliamentary elections 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over several years in the Middle East order of magnitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy campaig@@ ning for terrorism must again be under penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the right to arms will be improved in such a way that the purchase of weapons in the internet is more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last much discussed tail light for physicians is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions to reduce the threat to citizens , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior spoke clearly against activ@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a cow@@ ard@@ ly for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka prohibition and the abolition of dual nationality .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ term wear under constitutional law .
you can &apos;t b@@ ypass all that you are rej@@ ecting , and I oppose the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talk about rules about traffic or witnesses to court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green @-@ boss Sim@@ one Peter said to the minister that he wants to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terror pack@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the act of action and action &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet adjustments and a tigh@@ tening of the right of stay bring people no more safety in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
it st@@ umps regularly on the stra@@ pping road - here a picture of November .
but this is to change : the right to do justice is to be extended .
this is good news for all the car drivers who stand in traffic on the environmental street every evening in traffic jam when driving over the highway to Zu@@ ro@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16th / 17th of August ) , road construction is extended by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ eler Straße .
drivers can then th@@ addle directly from the Hammer street on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is spread early , thus improving the overall sequence on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District &apos;s representative Münster @-@ West .
the driver &apos;s lane con@@ stri@@ ction on the feeder is annoying , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
the back@@ stage stretches up to the bridge across the Alber@@ ob@@ long way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason for this is the needle hole on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here the traffic is diver@@ ted only one lane above the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt a few years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge did not have the necessary load capacity to absorb heavy load traffic .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related work @-@ day traffic will last , the responsible state enterprise cannot say .
however , with years to reck@@ on , because the bridge has an official remaining usable period up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the state company deliberately chose to reduce the amount of traffic in the school holidays because of disability .
the traffic will be left on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years of age visited the staging at the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , according to the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg of Spe@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; goes on .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the Stern@@ schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern a line through the bill in the night of Germany on Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the heaven spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the star @-@ shed is Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour is one of the quick@@ est shooting stars .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep in the morning before the wake up ring@@ ing .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the Board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and S@@ leep Medicine .
however , what one understands by land@@ less is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , an in@@ som@@ nia and sleeping disorder .
it is precisely the sleeping feeling that many people perceive as uns@@ atis@@ fying or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
sleeping disorder is often an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and may start thinking about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disturbances become a doctor ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , advises you on the process .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten down , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
among other things , treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly any drop in sleep medicine in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin .
therefore , when sleeping problems , one should first contact the family doctor , advises the we@@ aving process .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for example , in the case of snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , in case of path@@ ological day @-@ fatigue , sleep conver@@ ters or if one does not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze says .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera draws up the sleeping person on the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of uns@@ cre@@ wing screws on which one can set for a better sleep .
the process counts : regular sleep and up@@ time , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV to fall asleep , avoid alcohol and don &apos;t look at night at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler turned on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the Short @-@ Railway World Championships in Doh@@ a , and at the same time presented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gains € 20,000 bonus and a jungle of € 150@@ ,000 no @-@ one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not so closely watch or even operate on dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be kept with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger , which meanwhile operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : bound by baggage
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
on Thursday civilians of the Düsseldorf police were able to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 .
as a gang , the susp@@ ects had committed several bags and luggage ste@@ els .
at 9 : 30 pm , civil servants in the area of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport recognized a gang of police officers from past rob@@ ber off@@ ences .
the two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and were involved in a collaborative , work@@ able and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the C@@ ID Committee 34 can prove four acts that have been lod@@ ged for off@@ ences of crimes committed to Germany .
in doing so , they had captured a total of more than 15.000 Euro .
old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between still a few cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not seem so at first sight , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by playing grounds , a fres@@ co @-@ painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumped on the facade of a gray house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite to a Li@@ dl , which is to be disman@@ tled soon , is already built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; articles about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , are , however , preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the inhabitants now have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , particularly the Berlin inner sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard police action against the project , called the area as a &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after having cleared the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers on the 22nd June , the police pat@@ rolled out official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , the building workers were renovated on behalf of the unknown owner of the house .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the evacu@@ ation had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers moved from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer after@@ no@@ ons the street acts peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who prefers three children here , is mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern about rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a &quot; Kie@@ z , &quot; who wanted a majority of police protection from v@@ and@@ alism on the left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police put up between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbors , does not exist so clearly .
Friedrichsha@@ in , east of Berlin , was actually a traditional workers &quot; quarter , which today has a low average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was swept under great police orders in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ s from around the world : they now share residents of East German times and former home owners their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on disc@@ arded slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have been disc@@ arded with paint @-@ bags .
no other street was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes like bodily injury are , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the biggest part of the criminal off@@ ences cause serious damage , which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years alongside the disputed 94 , there is no question of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is wei@@ ghty : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rig@@ a@@ er .
for the architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here you can help each other , live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved into the Riga road - and remained .
this is why it was also so important that residents get their way back : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all of them suddenly stressed the right of interpretation over the district .
however , in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former construction gaps which the old inhabitants are displac@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are actually con@@ domini@@ ums which are not interesting for many here - people tend to live here that are not as good as they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
there fru@@ stration arises on all sides , including the police and the residents .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for zo@@ oms , who fre@@ t themselves over colour bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who draw near should be aware of this - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area that can complain badly about noise .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be named with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organisation .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ghty wo@@ ollen mil@@ ks@@ a , which has above all a problem .
this meant some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ously than on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant when the administration wanted to leave the place .
we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an egg @-@ reli@@ ving wo@@ ollen mil@@ ks@@ a .
but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it fixed a 50 percent position on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time stakeholders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding issues .
soon there are new containers in the was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Board of Directors to the Commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not work so far as to rely on private dwell@@ ings , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
new containers will soon be installed in the was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ Euro @-@ jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who have to be und@@ et@@ ched or furnished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help hous@@ em@@ akers , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here too , administration and honorary officials jump here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
those who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority was motivated .
but there are problems , &quot; says customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing works . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are the two after the most recent events afraid of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small congregation like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer explains quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people like to call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins were bringing them out completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region .
in doing so , they always have in mind that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid .
it is actually unfair to put them on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , this would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the original version of the original version has already been utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
