<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>

<seg id="11">He let himself run with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even shoot himself for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO.</seg>

<seg id="15">It does not lack the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorravine, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Slingbacks Economic Policy Compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are not at all about tax and energy policy, as well as in a basic question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamentally philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">This, on the role of the State.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep this small in doubt and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, asserts Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively return regulators, and he is committed to a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, states: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich are being increased, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">That must be invested, say Trump and Clinton almost equals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump, party-internal discussions could also come.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump plans to build coal-fired power plants and drive back coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction will also be possible in so far protected areas, he wants to announce the Paris Climate Protection Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "on the other hand, Clinton wants to explicitly extend the renewable energy with its investment program and demands:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazied trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both the US do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, Clinton calls for.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation wages.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump does in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rushed, then he says that he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "on the one hand, Trump confronts the economy and citizens to boost growth." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics point out that the budget deficit would only be larger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the Executive Director of Condrobs, a supporter of social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs has set up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "in women, other reasons for the flight outweigh:" "" "many are secretly stealing it because they see no other way out." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have had experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honours, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "for example, that tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," "" "says Bahr." ""</seg>

<seg id="31">Even here, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior or abused in the worst case.</seg>

<seg id="38">Some with no answer to the question of whether or not they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in accommodations of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also in Swabia only fled women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or their own houses in some common shelters or their own homes only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central properties exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the committee" "" "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" "" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be lodged separately by men." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish opposite player in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to be narrowly and radiant, even for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the other hand spoke repeatedly about his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper complained that Erdogan had behaved as if there had never been anything worse.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at that time was burning.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced him and accused Ankara of falling into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offense was even greater, as it was done by an alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousins becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, state-controlled media launched a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious accusations led by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clearly obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after spending the last month in a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State TV projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedasti described it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West, as it looks at its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "this is due to the continued resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara with certainty that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "this is well-evident for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep fear of regime changes." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an "Alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described to me: two countries that are violated and treated badly by the West and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents stated at the press conference that they would not even have stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shot the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State should at least speak with one another.</seg>

<seg id="15">Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone which few have reached before him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellect, which differentiates him from the others in the weight control room.</seg>
<seg id="17">He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma enthralled fans for years for this sport.</seg>
<seg id="18">I told Frankie some weeks ago at Epsom that he had already gotten 6.000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and Grand-turnir jockey!</seg>
<seg id="19">Frankie has been ridden almost 30 years in the UK, which is great.</seg>
<seg id="20">He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but in addition he is an incredible jockey.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount</seg>
<seg id="22">Flying from Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the UK flat race for two decades.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was nerve wrecking.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fire Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of Putin's close trust for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed special envoy for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that without stating reasons" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs was ordered by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been the deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born 1972 in Tallinn, Estonian capital, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it means (in Russian) that he was later a log chief and chief of staff of the staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it's the main task of the government to support your activity as head of state on bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow a mystery.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was one of the closest confidants Vladimir Putin for a long time and works like he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile on the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a sort of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president, suddenly wants to lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in the beginning of 2012 in a conversation, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - exhausting posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin a former member of the State Security Service (KGB).</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was president of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached the power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as Putin's third term would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally taken by Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the Norddeck of the Queenswear crossings with the Viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closures of the" "" "ceiling blower" "", "which are approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bevel ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said: "this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queenswear crossings.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total bridge decks at their place and the last section of the deck now get a concrete finish in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project, the closure is the trendsetting high-rise and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck in the extension, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or south side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">As the tolerances on which the team worked, they were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and the Greens mean: in the future, investors should be taken much more seriously." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD proposes a" "" "living concept living" "" "at the next council session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a provision is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D vice-president Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can also be built on stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">The big point in the town hall, however, is that Bratmann says: "how can we deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "a new urban housing development programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem is that Bratmann says: "there is no agreement between the factions at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make as few rules as possible for investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder supports for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">No matter how viola, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is growing.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: the 1260 new apartments, which were to be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how can we offset the loss of more than 1,300 affordable housing, whose extraction will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to plan spokeswoman Nicole Palm, current bonds should now be bought from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, we would have to think about getting apartments back to the price.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the west town Frists are running out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased again, the aim of so-called mixing is to be removed.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged people in just a few parts of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">Teenagers and children can no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been complained by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people out of the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest decreased slightly prior to the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon based on a GPS and, once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the maiden and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in increments that the "average" person puts back every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of pursued people who train every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to take "30 minutes" to come "from the sofa" and "being active every day" met deaf ears because many public messages for health are boring and come from people looking miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that they enjoy.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine plus fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close friends on hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are lacrirical gamebies that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, because of Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, helping many people hunt more actively, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breath taking on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on the whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast drowned the title of the campaign on Thursday and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American woman Simone Biles will draw on the hovering bar during the solo campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bille is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a competition title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears, when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport of the last three years, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou rescuon from her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited her last examination in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between cheap and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the Spring, Texas family would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in a single campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Bilal took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell celebrations of retired man-ordinator Martha Karolyi served as an exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Bilal insisted on having never planned the future during their long absence, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - including their typical Tumbling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gym in which Boorman trained, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost a competition competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina was slightly led by two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Brim beams and ground floor - in which Bille holds the world title - louder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the suspended brim - and sat on the floor with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her grandness - a pure formality - and tears poured on fine red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collective book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team captain, called "grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "after her" "" "Bodenworsening" "" "she threw away the audience from the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful." ""</seg>

<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shootings led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were linked to four previous attacks.</seg>

<seg id="10">The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to their injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died still on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to call on the emergency stand on Friday. it is expected to have more rainfalls all Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the south east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with widespread flooding after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards told that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, said that the requests for floods, boats and sand bags increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that alone the commune of Tangipahoa had claimed tens of thousands of sand bags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used for large parts in southern Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service allowed that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it was still raining in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels after the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream inundation in Ascension Parish is a danger, as it will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas via the trodden rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, arrived on Friday at 09.00 the highest level ever recorded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still got people from the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued near Glover on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>

<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife said Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years where she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Globe, where they were accommodated until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said the flooding had "spread quickly," as there were still severe rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the rain has been considerably outweighed due to rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities reported that heavy rains and flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and Lesson in five boroughs.</seg>
<seg id="27">The WWF CBS subsidiary reported that a co-ordinate in Tangipahoa caused 200 pre-flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were rinsed by floods.</seg>

<seg id="31">"" "" "" "as soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the commune of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of roads were closed due to flooding and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part, hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"the last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.</seg>

<seg id="35">In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said that it was raining on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his data, a handful of houses were reported to have been reported inundated on Thursday, but no reports were reported on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I set up at the Women's Olympics in the Turning and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I've been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who had an inspiring effect on many young girls from other skin colours.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess, and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally mirroring the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one of the female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America rejoiced.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world has been able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, but masterful gynaecological routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this kind of sport, but so do gymnastic classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to get it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympics will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts first and foremost in private gymnastic associations which are maintained by parents who pay for the training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in prosperous suburbs to support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to provide the communities with innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-access gym training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events, we have offered free and affordable prices in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international victors.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high quality gymnastics to the young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this fantastic Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">NICE's NICE regulator has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people each year suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the artery walls which form layers.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the base breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that caches the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clot triggers, it can flow through the flow of blood and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more improbable.</seg>
<seg id="13">NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered heart attacks have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>

<seg id="16">Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Thanks to a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>

<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year due to corruption coming from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities how a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, accesses the police, election observers and Rathenhouses for ignoring evidence of abuse due to "hypersensitivity regarding ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "the former Minister of Integration and the municipal government, who is now a slave-king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of election booths to protect intimidated voters." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he recommends that voters should have an identification card to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter must only name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink on a person's finger when they leave their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial betrayal culture that goes along with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral scandal in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special selection court ruled that the incumbent mayor Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupted and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way," and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman is said to have led" "" "His campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to elect him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation, in which one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">In particular, he voiced alarm on the fraudulent choice of letters - in which the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding spouts to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "as proof was appropriate that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="7">Then beat it with your knee in the groin and twist the weapon out of his hands while the attacker is combating from pain. hit him with the run and move backwards while holding the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot, seize the weapon and twist it, so that the aggressor cannot shoot.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and thrower of a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk switched his course on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaving each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," "" "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of removing the rinsing button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe Mr Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public rail to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task put his immune system definitely under a rehearsal</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample screed showed a luminometric number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometric number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after her luminometry figure of more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "That's the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to lick here because it's disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios Senior Vice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something fascinating to look at while explaining the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we caused crazy brainstorming that ended up saying" "" "Let us call Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had to lick him, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to dock them and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these filthy goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015 84 percent of all lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of gastrointestinal and intestines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing attached lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="5">The artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary a childhood dream.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.</seg>

<seg id="18">"she is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as Römerin," laughs Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not vote on the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">2021 will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For more stupidity than hitherto it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who want to be convinced by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not natives, so you can't choose the land day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count on the end of votes, only laboriously apply.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has yet to pass an election campaign just close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newbie AfD cuts off and what remains at the end coalition-dusty.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributing roses and chatting a little with the people, just as his legendary former predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and chancellor Merkel is blaming for the bloom of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, their" "" "We create the" "" "accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale talks twice; Merkel federal elections are located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxonia than the Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it too regrets nobody from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Northeast CDU largely renounces the usual campaign conditions on marketplaces and in front of shopping centres with sunshades and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that means coking, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union also noted that in the country you have to brush the groundwater so that it is very hard to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any left in the sides of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the advice of the CDU campaigner coking for his co-workers is also self-exposing:" "" "they must go where it hurts, namely, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats last reached 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election in 2011, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the Green Party, with seven percent in polls, is likely to make the leap into parliament." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30 a.m. and ending at about 20 o'clock in the morning, there is always praise.</seg>

<seg id="5">This is a super-team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The opposite will also be given to those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has migrated to the south on Monday and also the closure of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and the connection to Rottenburg continues, the traffic situation within the place has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive movement through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some serious complaints," says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachhofstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were hiding in residential areas.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breaks with them leaves every one you ask.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and the half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President-President Jörg Schmidt, on a request from Göhner, asked if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regular guests are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's also very nice somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his family-list returns to the end of the redevelopment work.</seg>
<seg id="43">In spite of the crises with BSE and a bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on his customers for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its many years of history.</seg>

<seg id="22">In the case of Dulings for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than so far - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers to obscure their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are politically and legally sacred.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them still seem outright and leaves issues open.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks from Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, many people worried about security in view of the high number of refugees.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Records: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged loving plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comments section, in order to sow it under the pseudonym non-alliterate men's middle age with harsh insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the rebirth of vinyl records is not due to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects but to Midlife-Nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight, between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers prefer their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and grazing wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something better than: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers are located - there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such businesses and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men, one woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4000 records.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dressed the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and buy objects he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably were a little too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records tend to be introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I led, people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the record revision of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers received an impetus on the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound plate sleeves, of objects that wake up happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a sort of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector so I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "said an employee of a panel stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I smoothen through a stack of bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came in here and said:" I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead gramophone record so I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-consuming, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts newest Synthesizer- and sextpacked Pop instead of experimental jazz conciles from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but serious mental trauma is hard to detectable if one stands beside someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-shopping as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not deserve much, therefore collecting plates is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways but the beauty of records is..." "" "she drives off with a dearted sigh." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I'm pretending to have a pair of jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouped for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers might send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most for luxury objects such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov are correct, they don't take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with the bumming through record shops of the Berwick Street and the sheets by records, while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator who raises nothing of middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional businesses, in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energydrinks, sell, sell hairdressers or buy tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and the risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups informed the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were absolutely comprehensible. "</seg>

<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the rain was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp which is operated by a community and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum items for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis in the final on Thursday evening, when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, side-stitching, back-up, line and roher strength to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation price of the silver medal - Great Britain fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The obvious defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but it is not likely that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England of Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lost one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and pushed the attacks of GBs for fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell an and Co., as if you were running into driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau turned off in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With only four minutes of playing time Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he walked.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB has hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A tight Tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Yasa Veremalua points out a Touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the second kick and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presides by further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while still learning the UK.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Tuisova was running through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an experiment for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the southern sailors whose fans sang, flags waved and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis embraced and GB kicked down crushingly in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier this day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-finals match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant, late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, secured the winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than with these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last 220 hard pieve that go into history Helen Glover and Heather Stations found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was present at the moment when she joined the second Olympics in a second without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports, which made such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39th non-beaten work, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athlets gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of triumphal goose.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to incremental progress that make the difference and nobody was more instrumental than the coach who didn't know 30 months ago if he was diagnosed with cancer at all.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that was operated and that was what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads out everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if this is the right term at all.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>

<seg id="8">Rupert Göller, who has been working for 31 years in the Zweckverband employee, stands behind all this, 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are the municipalities Kirchuth, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairperson, Breitbrunns mayoral Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water-keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency procedures on weekends," "" "said the Chairman." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchases in the new well (1998) and compensation of farmers, the refurbishment of the elevated tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer controller (2004) and the repurchase of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no standstill and there have always been innovations, because water is the most important foodstuff and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation, she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and proper service for over 31 years.</seg>

<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Water wart Alfons Griebel who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterkeeper and he was a faithful companion.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view, he described the construction of well and the restructuring of the Zweckverband.</seg>

<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night, so that the towns could be supplied with water.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - German steel industry view</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Survey at the existing facilities for so-called self-flow production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really glad that we could finally reach the negotiations tough after two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works fall into an EEG-envelope of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not objected in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">As a result, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely ascertained.</seg>
<seg id="13">Particular importance has been given to the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "with regard to our campaign" "" "Steel is future" "", "this is a first step." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "even in the reform of emissions trading, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," "" "said IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and a significant price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation worsened when the world's largest producer country, China, faced massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, the import duties imposed on import steel show effect; on the other hand, economic prospects in China have spread.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is not clear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have been stagnating.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">Finally, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closing of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers are cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Economic Association Steel announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back to the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been by two percent below the prior-year figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increasing output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all his life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the Lehramt-Studium, she occupied the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall livelier, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good about her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives," "" "says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors are singing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and nurture social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">Ursel Kipp made this experience in her choir: "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because of this, seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of the puste in everyday life as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Seniors Organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens a lot of memories, often combined with positive feelings of her adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-denied people deceive themselves on long-recalled events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special performance is demanded for the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone do not only focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced by singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise something for a long time, I will be better and waxed more than myself - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing are enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - for 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound comes next?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, Seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who would like to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosions went up again, and a further person was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the detonation close to the popular beach resort Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani, on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the heel was blown up in a flower bed in front of the revier of the coast police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, there were several injured detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-western coast as well as in Chumphon on the Southeast Coast several injured.</seg>
<seg id="15">From a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," "" "said army general Danai Kritethavee Friday morning before journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we expect it to be a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is too early to manifest itself to possible motives - probably it is a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize in the attacks a pattern that is typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs have been placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days, the authorities have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce the security of important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are repeatedely smaller bomb attacks, but mostly they are not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace built over the years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between the security forces and the Muslim populations, there will be no need to travel to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta CEO and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs had been an attempt to create chaos while the country was moving towards stability, improving economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military junta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, resists itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to get a grip on the revolt of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">Over 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest assault of the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic games and world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center, the marginally important swimmers from Ethiopia swam so slowly that it was no longer visible in the TV pictures.</seg>

<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was subsequently turned into a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his course with a setback of 48 seconds and reserved the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special startright from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more well-known.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because most sportsmen are running in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something different.</seg>

<seg id="17">His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100-metre-free style, played no part.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the run by Eric Moussambani provided media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to travel alone over 100 meters of freestyle on his own.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically, Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of wastewater amounts to 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros for the sewage system Neudorf / Reuth / Welthoahl, 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros. for the supply of Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (up to now 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3.2 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf, the sewage charge will increase at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a successively sleepy calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the Council of the Council of Kulmbach, undercover was established for these sewage systems.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from World Bank, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Administrative Director, Herbert Schmidt explained to the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the sewer systems of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous calculation period were also to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained that there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack on all three sewage systems, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their old age refurbishment and repair expenses were incurred in a considerable extent in all three plants, not least due to their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for World Bank, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt informed that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in Azendorf sewage plant due to damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">The nearly 20-year-old conveying systems had to be overhauled in the pumping station of the world. after nearly 20 years operation the first sewage sludge had to be evacuated, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation possibility was installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses incurred the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs which were still significantly below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were "fully smashed" in the three plants.</seg>
<seg id="20">According to Schmidt, the market community has remained spared from major entertainment costs in the sewer systems over the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the mentioned facilities will remain precarious in the long term, as one cannot expand the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater utility company in order to avoid these facilities because they are deficient.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticised as Asian cartoon</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unsensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are bluntly, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it proposed a filter to a couple of users, who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and cheeks, some critics called it racist cartoon of Asians - "Yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves whether these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended to pay tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime-comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely distributed over the photos, wrote that the filter was" "" "fragile and saleable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian cartoon and filter effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face was drawn into the bottoming extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in our hands.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters generates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much harder that such things stay unnoticed when it was the case before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on medium and in a telephone interview, she said that they believe that racist controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the modelling practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership of false ISIS intelligence, rejects the Committee of the Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic view of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the actual conditions were permitted on site, an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican Members of the Discident Committee, Secret Service Commitee and the Armed Forces Commites, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence-related information, typically enjoyed by high-ranking CentCom commandeurs, regularly marked a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on site had allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in CentCom reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows in detail continual problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips have given instructions under Obama to alter the reports, it shows how analysts face the pressure of their superiors, a more optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, opinions and statements before Congress were considerably more positive than the facts" "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosssules could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, it is so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of CentCom reports is being carried out by the Ministry of Defense's General Inspector.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, so Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "harmed the moral under analysts and" "" "gave excessive little space for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Ship and the democrats gave no indication of an intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts in regard to a" "" "specific political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who were ingested according to complaints made by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press spokesperson, in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the allegations of the past year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a written reference about how the then government under George W. Bush had foreseen only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these temporary refineries had been commissioned to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this recognition was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centres damaliger commander, Comrade Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events are constant and inescapable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristband to the swimmer to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's chat in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Leaked or the fight between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a swarm of women with dimples, could well be among these well-known names being sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being TV commercials if he was a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not highlight any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shadow are the sports, which are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it reign long.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should be modest in arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had their debut in Sydney, it was so sparsely noticed the last 16 years that many who asked me did not know that it is an Olympic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, there has never been a medal in jumping on trampolines and until 2012 they had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert but only an earthbound enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humoristic potential - the cartoonical trembling of its never-ending bouncing - but also the grazie of gymnastics and pigeon, the two kinds of sports that are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to official Olympic programme, they are rated according to the design, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists need to go further, faster, up and down in their quest to gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes down and back, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the exit wall, but also a further highlight in television transmission: the world or the Olympic cord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is posh, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces down, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The women's qualification and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time, which the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his air rinding new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia greeted the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police in the event of gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia having just collapsed?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos on the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it was always difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even harder," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in Addis Abeba capital.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was reduced, with dissidents effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or sent to prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you are suppressing people and have no other options to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Sestat Tesat, a professor in Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been forced more or less in recent years to exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness gradually explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, since cheaper smartphones are becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies hiding where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians found that they were so close to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of eons, the Amharas, who come from aedics mainly to Christian high lands, prospered in politics and economics as they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to co-ordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Zachu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairingly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly interested in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process enemies and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such a turmoil was 2005 after thousands of protesters protested, according to claims by analysts seemingly fuelled by the government and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in the last months and that time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal demise of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked businesses by Tigray and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests brought the US and other Western allies into a strange position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently announced that she has closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Donald Trump declares his assertion Obama was founded by ISIS" "" "sarcasm" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to scatter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by anging that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings along its competitors who endeavour to take it in protection during an eventful phase, in the particular position to have explanations that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the suggestion of an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump called back on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day, where Mr. Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation was totally serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate wanted nothing of it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism plasselt down on Mr. Trump, while trying to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to declining demand figures.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday, Mr. Trump again tried to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already advanced sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he raised strong criticism when he said that the Russians were to hack Clinton's emails, but later he explained, "Of course, I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction precipitates." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert observing the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of resolving the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an additional tone because his demand values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris published on Friday showed a lead with a huge margin in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing on the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump sums up his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent advocates of Trump, had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was asked to correct Mr. Trump's statements if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organisation, he called them backbrokers, completely false, and that is why it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in the Clinton Clinton as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread out by allowing them to take control of the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Prior to the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being on each of his words and preoccupied against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As gourmets, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacies at Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Waterturtle Soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "her husband Andrew Coe added," "" "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, local snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered hacksley, this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheaper, which stretches the ingredient.</seg>

<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have been in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pâté for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the first world war." "" "a Square Meal" "" "draws the routes with which the country was going to no longer be the land of Schlaraffenland." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central issue," "" "Coe asked why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new diet was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole as a "wonderful way of regenerating food residues," Brickman noted, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dry fruits.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serviced luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar mixtures were tried out, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy cooking.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this time, baked onions with peanut butter, too.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it was not a popular addition at lunch," "" "Coe says." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelman continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - continued the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" "" "household policies" "" "and to be able to meet the challenge of converting Pampe as creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a feast of historic treats." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports of the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-Cake-Food-attitude, are particularly tasty.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farming kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke like the millionfold man of the world to which he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked a continental kitchen like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was delightfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor would have asked him to take an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the hire of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors made by Mrs Roosevelt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting ones. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, deal with food, was rejected as soon as the country got back on its legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calorie and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to foods.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Brickman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how they could not throw food away.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she had a real fear of wasting food," "" "Coe said." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Brickman remembered, "They really made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the incident of the wind.</seg>

<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it's called Prune Whip," "" "said Ziegelman, and added that it was a nasty trick to give a modest name to modest recipes." ""</seg>

<seg id="51">Everyone divulged a spoon in the tamed, brown glibber.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönland hai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back into the sea following an investigation on board the Ship Ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and floats at a distance of 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland's sharks will only get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1.220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates at a full speed of 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle influenced by slowness, however, seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal "Science" at least one Greenland shark, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "mad," "" "Alexander Scheuerlein comments from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist believed long ago that Greenland's hair could be stoned.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence failed.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated areas of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion measured them as they carried out six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Maybe they hunt dormant animals or patrol on the bottom of the polar sea and look for cadaver that torment from higher water layers to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland haidens, who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetre was measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens evolves before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly a lot of carbon-14 in the lens-core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth, therefore, was to lie after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons hunt more quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the length of the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lentil core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons experiments, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland haidens, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14-amounts in their lentils, generated by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark is likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length could assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres was probably at the threshold of sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's sharks with the increase obviously allow at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such Methusalites live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, whose bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on asparagus flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">They then ripen later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the eye care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch (St. Anna) were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were dealt with together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next generation of Romish strants in two years, the ministerial Round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out several days of pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided on the Bishop's city of Freiburg, where in this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, there was a special pilgrimage destination on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, of Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of the rooms of the saints, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Pastor Storost sent the pilgrims at a small ceremony in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage church and shared the Pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer loved one, and so the Pilgrim's Way started from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis made a break at field crossroads, chapels or churches in order to sing together a song of specially made pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For overnight stays the parish homes of the local parish were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage guests Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller have taken care of a tasty and fortifying dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after, the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, had to be climbed about 500 altimeters at a muggy heat and then climbed up afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of the Pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went on the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived in Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse God was given thanks.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening mass in Münster, the Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the city district.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last evening in the men's team sprint at Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23 year old from Glasgow took the anchor, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy to Eigen. the JPG profaned the legend when he stormed home to bring home a victory from the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in London in March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a result.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement caused a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scotsman, which now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner scored an Olympic cord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Behind his lap was slightly back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow him down and enable Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked up from his position as BBC expert and fell skinny, Kenny and Hinds when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the victory in 2012 on Kenny's and Hoy's side, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he deliberately dropped onto the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such a superb victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said:" "" "it feels like the whole Great Britain flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together in the last three months as a team.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that has won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny it is in the realm of the possibility that he will repeat Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in one contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be equal to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I enjoy this only for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the target in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in 2012 in London, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he argued with officials before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on its strong web-driven team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to bring a crowd of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas took place in the background, thus the resignation of the technical manager Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of sexism and mobbing vorcers, as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which reached its climax at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to the abolition of the energy contract in question</seg>
<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium smelting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus abolish all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, not to grant any further subsidies to the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects since the enamel consumed about 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa joined the Point Henry Schmeling, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland will lose money and risk closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-term speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and, last, due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, informed that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The facility is located in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL expects the plant to continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity through the melt-melt," said the company.</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL further said that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions," which would have come into force in November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12-month period of notice, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "this is why AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenues in the financial year 17," "" "said the electricity supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the earnings of AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written down the value of the contracts in its annual depreciation of $187 million in "expecting a termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "said Alcoa that the decision to issue the contracts, the" "" "Alcoas ability... to operate the melt or to ensure the supply of the enamel" "" "does not compromise" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said there was a 20 year contract signed with Loy Yang in 2010, which would have come into force from November this year, even though there is still an explanation of why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn because of poor economic conditions in the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to the analysts "statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and around 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>

<seg id="2">During the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (September 18), considerable losses for the SPD and CDU are recorded.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted from representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the north, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD plunged from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was just close to the CDU, which could return to 23 percent again.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite an easy loss of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent), the Greens hesitated again into the Schwerin Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP were not represented in the Landtag with 3 percent each.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to explore the past of Venus through tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if Venus could have rejected earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still turned slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protected from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day-side of the sun almost two months," "" "stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, resembling the evolution of planets that had previously been suspected of planetary scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was presumably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billion years.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars revolve around different rates and in which context the rotational periods are related to planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>

<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>

<seg id="1">2016 Olympics: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A swiss athlete had almost won a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese Schwimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter steeple runner in Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critically acclaimed Athletics Championships, these messages come to an accident.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen the diuretic Hydrochlorothiazide was already demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterflies, just by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have to take part in the courses over 50 m of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B-sample and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very seriously and requires full cooperation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news filtered through the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV channel BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report it is said to be the banned substance for the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately reported his criticism of the bulletin.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the sportsmen are not pulling the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For instance, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case called "Adrian Zielinski," the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested three days previously positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, the Danekova case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association had prohibited the entire Russian squad except for systematic doping, even the irresnation Kenya made numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the swimming sport, the earlier offences in China caused violent clashes also between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is how the Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion, Sun Yang.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium above 200 m of freestyle, I want to commit myself," "" "said Lacourt in the French radio." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so Perfide invade hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware attack companies currently - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware Abwehr specialists Malwarebytes among 540 firms in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the goal of ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they succeed there, the potential to blackout ransom is considerably higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a scary fast evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleccynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place in the past months in a frightening manner.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware operates according to a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for imprint files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and effectively deletes the originals.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail compressor.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end turn code into the files, the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production standstills.</seg>
<seg id="17">Correspondingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware falls.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of German companies reported losses due to ransomware, 13 per cent even had to interrupt operations completely, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of acute cases.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always tell the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Klecznski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, on the other hand, know this and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user areas and contact with the blackmasts and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They account for their victims by chatting how they can pay via Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decode example files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies will have to bargain hard negotiating and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively low-risk profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more and more professional and share their work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The present malware kits were created by installing malware on themselves, consulting and additional tools for a one-time fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackers are then looking for more hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you logs in one of the forums in the background, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals employ spammer to spread," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey rely on repelling Ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful deployment, the perpetrators are instead threatening with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculation," "" "explains Malwarebytes Chief Marcin Kleccynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that, depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators will also be able to completely new goals on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the deco-conference of Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could gain a thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such blocked heating could certainly be a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">It stumps regularly on the strapping road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this is to change: the right to do justice is to be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all the car drivers who stand in traffic on the environmental street every evening in traffic jam when driving over the highway to Zuroinger (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the coming Tuesday and Wednesday (16th / 17th of August), road construction is extended by 700 meters in the area between the Hammer Road and the Weseler Straße.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then thaddle directly from the Hammer street on the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The big advantage: the traffic is spread early, thus improving the overall sequence on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can't think of sleep in the morning before the wake up ringing.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the Board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, what one understands by landless is the insomnia, that is, an insomnia and sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is precisely the sleeping feeling that many people perceive as unsatisfying or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Sleeping disorder is often an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is often common in depression," "" "says Weeping." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and may start thinking about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbances become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, advises you on the process.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten down, tired, sleepy, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other things, treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any drop in sleep medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medical centre of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, when sleeping problems, one should first contact the family doctor, advises the weaving process.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the case of snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of pathological day-fatigue, sleep converters or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fietze says.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After cladding, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera draws up the sleeping person on the ceiling.</seg>

<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of unscrewing screws on which one can set for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">The process counts: regular sleep and uptime, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, don't watch TV to fall asleep, avoid alcohol and don't look at night at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmers Markus Deibler turned on Facebook to disappoint the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he took gold for the first time at the Short-Railway World Championships in Doha, and at the same time presented his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler placed himself in front of his ex-team-mates in front of his critics.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in a country where an Olympic champion gains €20,000 bonus and a jungle of €150,000 no-one should be surprised about missing medals," "" "the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in the swimming sport is bad, whereas doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not so closely watch or even operate on doping.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "I don't say that the controls should be set here," "" "he continued." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Deutschland (NADA).</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday civilians of the Düsseldorf police were able to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a gang, the suspects had committed several bags and luggage steels.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 9: 30 pm, civil servants in the area of Dusseldorf Airport recognized a gang of police officers from past robber offences.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several crimes since the middle of July and were involved in a collaborative, workable and particularly professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the CID Committee 34 can prove four acts that have been lodged for offences of crimes committed to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In doing so, they had captured a total of more than 15.000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, some linden trees, in between still a few cobblestones: the Riga road in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem so at first sight, but the police count them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one goes along the road from east to west, one passes by playing grounds, a fresco-painted kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly" "" "jumped on the facade of a gray house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite to a Lidl, which is to be dismantled soon, is already built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "articles about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, preferred over the past few weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, the inhabitants now have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin inner senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard police action against the project, called the area as a "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After having cleared the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers on the 22nd June, the police patrolled out official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, the building workers were renovated on behalf of the unknown owner of the house.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the evacuation had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved from sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoons the street acts peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who prefers three children here, is mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a "Kiez," who wanted a majority of police protection from vandalism on the left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin inner senator and the police put up between house-occupiers and their neighbors, does not exist so clearly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain, east of Berlin, was actually a traditional workers "quarter, which today has a low average income compared to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer street very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was swept under great police orders in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who occupied it 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and polls from around the world: they now share residents of East German times and former home owners their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on discarded slices or freshly painted facades, which have been discarded with paint-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other street was mentioned this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes like bodily injury are, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest part of the criminal offences cause serious damage, which tend to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years alongside the disputed 94, there is no question of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is weighty: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here you can help each other, live together on the street and get more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Riga road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was also so important that residents get their way back: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all of them suddenly stressed the right of interpretation over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps which the old inhabitants are displacing.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are actually condominiums which are not interesting for many here - people tend to live here that are not as good as they are," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There frustration arises on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for zooms, who fret themselves over colour bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw near should be aware of this - just like someone who pulls into a pub area that can complain badly about noise.</seg>

<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organisation.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eighty woollen milksa, which has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant some - less ridiculously than on the multitude of demanding tasks - meant when the administration wanted to leave the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an egg-reliving woollen milksa.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It fixed a 50 percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time stakeholders." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Board of Directors to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work so far as to rely on private dwellings, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be installed in the wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Forecasts to 2018 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-Euro-jobs and temporary employment for refugees and migrants who have to be undetched or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "reports Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help housemakers, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here too, administration and honorary officials jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems, "says customer honestly," people with whom nothing works. "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are the two after the most recent events afraid of radicalization, even in a small congregation like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer explains quite clearly," "" "some people like to call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins were bringing them out completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">In doing so, they always have in mind that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we have not yet arrived where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine client also makes it clear that the original version of the original version has already been utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
