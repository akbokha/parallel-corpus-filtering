Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but at the meeting , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama &apos;s deal for the Iranian nuclear program has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech that was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , a professor conf@@ esses to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; cute dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the phone .
inside the house , the officers found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular historical professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University &apos;s ly@@ n@@ x Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb had made a fatal emergency call after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the Gau@@ tier police , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for whom Lamb had worked so hard , would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb opened his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with some 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
he did his doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through shared friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her playing the guitar .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
all the girls had melted when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never hit Lamb , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ l when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail occurred three years ago both on a summer fair .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse working for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of 5th September after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were in the clearing and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the guard station , while the University Choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb did the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us states that there will not be so many Christmas seasonal workers as last year but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give him employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it is planning to set up 40,000 people in stores and sales centers throughout the country . 45@@ ,000 workers have been hired during the Christmas season of 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .

Michael J. Fox swe@@ ars over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I realise that the seat is empty next to me , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ n and an arm @-@ length from being on a date with the Princess of Wales .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ disputed the biggest travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his answer to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict lasting almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again demands all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the margins of the General Assembly meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban challenged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks at poll@@ s , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising hero Cain , none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ umps and start to drop their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps Any values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these numbers are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as a candidate .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; excited &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ can does not see the temp@@ er as a problem .
while critici@@ zing Donald Tr@@ ump for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the first pres@@ elect state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their ven@@ erable hats , repub@@ li@@ can voters keep Tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four from ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters are viewing the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even when the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump sums up almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to a drop of leadership , while the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support is diff@@ use to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvesting the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump are saying that they have firm their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called immigrants from Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , immigration was a hub in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic way of expression by Tr@@ ump is to keep His@@ pan@@ o Americans out of the Republi@@ can Party and damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for around half of the support of repub@@ li@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the New Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they &apos;re fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ishly anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential neighbor@@ hoods
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive con@@ domini@@ um - overlooking the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , one price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros nothing - per square meter , well noticed .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
tw@@ o@@ fold cake in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas Müller has just one barrel .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have taken a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally fetch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received a kind of assistance from the champion League to the Bayern leader@@ board in the Champions League to the Bayern leader@@ board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ oud promised in front of the game in the Kar@@ aj@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without having to shine .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including renowned clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they drew cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too mon@@ oton@@ ous in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by a game reloc@@ ation on the left @-@ sau@@ lt Douglas Costa , which rarely crossed the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k broke out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , when the Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown struck the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians attracted their habit @-@ dominated game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could use needle stit@@ ch .
but on the door@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er there was forgiveness .
for instance , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the beaten Lev@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ meter Müller still sat on it .
before the game , there had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partially m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their audience block evi@@ dently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with dr@@ um@@ sticks to the Munich fans .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
if you smoke , you do not only harm your lungs , but also your teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term study by Pots@@ dam@@ er .
the good news : when dispens@@ ing , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smokers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , the authors emphasize .
the relationship between smoking and tooth loss can therefore be attributed to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment was again sin@@ king to the level of non @-@ smokers , Er@@ stau@@ tor Thomas Dietrich explained by the English University of Birmingham .
one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , study director H@@ einer Boeing discovered by DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot;
smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , results in good dental health up to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of lack of tooth decay distributed the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter rem@@ nants of late anti@@ quity at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings near the construction site for the new Rhine @-@ bou@@ levard , &quot; said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ology of Natural History .
archae@@ ologists now found five in the third section of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ levard .
from text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with 350 tom@@ bs was also discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman has moved away from the railway station in the direction of the Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the population for help .
early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 o &apos;clock , the woman arrived from the direction of the station building and reached the track at the end of the railway platform and was recorded by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , it has been seriously wounded by the acquisition of the train .
it was treated locally and brought to a hospital by rescue personnel .
about the reason of the noc@@ tur@@ nal crossing of the young woman there is no knowledge of the medi@@ ating function@@ aries .
the incident was perhaps observed by witnesses or residents heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner railway , brick building , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ street and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question .
notices that indicate the cause of the accident can be given under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
EU Commission breaks new trial in dispute over TTIP
to mi@@ tig@@ ate the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transparent system that is significantly more traditional in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said European Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de intends to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
the TTIP will be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedures fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should be from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
until now , the parties involved agreed among themselves on refer@@ ees , a claim against their judgments did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months it has become clear that citizens from the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work according to its own specifications to an international investment court .
disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could then be clari@@ fied there , for example .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by major corporations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary to control tax pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Camp@@ act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , it has been critic@@ ised for failing to apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Minister for Economic Affairs , Matthias Mak@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , den@@ ounced the plans as great progress .
the Commission took into account key points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the law@@ suits of the economy by too many new rules .
small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could thereby be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year .
this date is no longer valid .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about different places , which he records repeatedly on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and wonderfully arranged songs .
where they arose and how it looks , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative Irish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 2003 and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seems wise composed songs , which blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is rum@@ oured that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be held in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhin@@ eland , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and canc@@ els some positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
live enough for him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York goes back to series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a sophisticated masterpiece appeared in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album enters the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no one @-@ year list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic counter@@ parts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth decent studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b .
the stage shows become a colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ strong band .
in the dark @-@ held ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the well @-@ adverti@@ sed St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can therefore disc@@ ard the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record in essence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only at an en@@ core is St@@ ev@@ ens modest , playing acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows with thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ en debut at the prime minister &apos;s question
Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s dé@@ but has been eag@@ erly awaited by Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s dé@@ but at the prime minister &apos;s design
the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , is supposed to make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s question and for the first time to invest with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary audit for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ne &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a celebration of the national an@@ them at a commemor@@ ative celebration on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several stories stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called upon to dis@@ agree with the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour makes changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to cut the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is a T@@ ory boss , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament .
the Labour leader , who has promised another policy approach , says that he has received &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron and given him more than 30.000 ideas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational and that he will refrain from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comb@@ at@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and stri@@ fe with hooks and instead intends to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example when Mr Cameron travels abroad .
he also discussed the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Theater &quot; that is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s frame . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling part of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and would require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose sharply to data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller business objective .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period in the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and fastest estim@@ ation since 2009 at the time of an interest rate increase .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 index increased by 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of his debt reduction strategy .
the shares in the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his appreciation for the company rating to &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports mour@@ ning company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the chief of J@@ D Sports states that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs for its company , &quot; he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .

compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who it@@ ches it ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber himself does not .
this has already taken care of .
for the advertisement in the commercial print of the super @-@ player he collected three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le firm , many , many dollars on the be@@ aver &apos;s account .
and with every doll that looks like he and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects .
when Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one mar@@ ries at the wind@@ screen .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e would go too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is just in the U.S. and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at No. 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , does not interest the many zer@@ os at first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanese to a potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - namely in the potato d@@ ön@@ er , which the Ol@@ denburg snack owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he accidentally saw on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer served in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has now been submitted to the Lebanese patent office in Munich .
according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility patent .
therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Ground Clear@@ ance Campa@@ ign to Fi@@ ght Al@@ di@@ - In@@ come
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ amor@@ has launched a campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the early next year , Met@@ amor@@ and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and expand the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and store shop@@ keepers who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to publish more details of its defense strategy on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investment strategy ag .
there is much at stake as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to about 14 percent in the Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and EUR 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year , Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the quantities on Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ amor@@ ín lost market shares in the Eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ a &apos;s revenue in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ amor@@ ín refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Executive Board of Met@@ amor@@ ín has contacted Ms Dou@@ glass last week .
i@@ GA@@ S market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has been dropped by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt and pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests over $ 150 million to che@@ er up sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve their shops selling fresh foods faster and to deliver a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging renovation programs to El@@ an will grow and hope that the wholes@@ aler will return for the first time in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and , according to the President of the Australian Tennis Federation , Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight due to the in@@ famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
soon after that , in a fi@@ ery qualifying match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent , R@@ yan Har@@ rison , had to be separated twice by the arbit@@ er , calling out Har@@ rison : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he beat a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook off a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m en@@ vious about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ gged into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is trained hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also did not support the decision to take account of the important preliminary ruling that starts on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everybody , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick was very quick to get up to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he goes up in the eyes of the public and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and governed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , when hundreds of migrants gathered in a No Man &apos;s land and responded to Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian readiness police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc in a controversial meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU countries would accept another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency stand called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having stopped a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and at the entrance point to the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or the off@@ ence of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree with the military &apos;s commitment to the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that some 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and accused of off@@ ences under the new laws .
authorities are to quickly repair the fence .
on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia after a train carriage crossed with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to enter there .
about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection from Serbia and Hungary , and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating nation@@ ally , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins over against the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 % of democratic voters in primary elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent rise ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t yet announced whether he is candidate for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ ander achieved some profits .
Clinton holds a major advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support in men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only 5 points behind .
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters aged 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
but Clinton still has a big margin for the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election nationwide say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm when nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also cited .
as the vice president poses a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the pres@@ election are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the helm .
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den is their second choice far ahead of S@@ ander .
if be@@ ers decide not to vote for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is increased from S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the vot@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries would be unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features among voters in the election of their party .
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best rewarded with hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons strength is the leader .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent don &apos;t think of it .
in general , democratic voters of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all of these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions related to H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term as foreign minister continue to be placed , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions have not influenced overall .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the issue had come to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s overall opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had still worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly Republi@@ can , more than six of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy of the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May .
62 per cent of those entitled to vote do not regard them as an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of those entitled to vote do not regard Tr@@ ump as unfair and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however Clinton and Tr@@ ump are receiving good notes for leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush work best with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in the country @-@ wide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the voters support the two candidates in the new survey , and others lose dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support nationwide drinking in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot at 23 % in the same period of 6 % .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and that tr@@ ump is sur@@ passed among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is at the lowest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 subjects of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed dr@@ unk@@ ers clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump had found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for questioning the belief in tr@@ umps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean for seaside vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people are no longer able to go to the sea : the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week has a maximum of 18 degrees , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood affected by the death of Bar@@ uch college students
almost two years after a student died during a religious ritual of a student &apos;s relationship in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transfer to the hospital , which contributed to his death .
officials said he had been charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fain@@ ted and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the National President of the Brotherhood , to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide and set the common good of the Brotherhood through Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was added to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs again with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder of the third count for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ous attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved but if there is an organisation which - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest
a rise in interest rates is coming , and the domestic demand is fu@@ elled , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance .
a recession came in just 11 months after the first rate of interest rate and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
hence representatives of the US Central Bank stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on raising interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement caused by interest increases could possibly be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &apos; cheap money &apos; era , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no effect .
here is a view based on historical trends about how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be reduced from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market has been in upward trend over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate increase , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six previous cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , Chief Plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , released at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the revenue cycle and the yield begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , there was only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 per cent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants settled all year on a F@@ ed interest rate , and all eyes were directed at the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the reduction cycles from 1950 to present have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ es have been put in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are so far 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the returns seem to change direction once the first raise / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle , the bond yields drop immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to yields between longer and shorter bonds closer together and lead to a down@@ turn in the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
what is interesting is that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have increased , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed shar@@ pen its strategy .
in large and large , companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will be po@@ orer , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react exceedingly positively three months after initial interest income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
firms with a strong balance sheet have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; debt will be a major problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
outside of pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts dis@@ agree on how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins interven@@ ed the show The Voice and said that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private tran@@ smit@@ ters do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly does not differ from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like using the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also went to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be only under another name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and order new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it had to be harder to work for the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sports came under fire to tramp@@ le the commercial rival on the feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins interven@@ ed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated € 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our own stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when the next time a series of entertainment star@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the fees for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales rose the slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the record in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issue in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there is evidence now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total spending for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has evolved over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales mix to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing revenues .
experts believe that shop@@ pers hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers got around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe Black Friday , on which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could stop buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium took out that £ 5 spent a little over £ 1 online .
for some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia bears witness to the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane crashed into Mec@@ ca &apos;s wholesale mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , mostly dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead occurred their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the mour@@ ning procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before , a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial when the Saudi king made a san@@ ction over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the catastrophe that left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 victims who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mo@@ ch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets .
among the dead , Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was the father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi press agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man revealed what caused the fall of the crane which r@@ ushed into a large mos@@ que courtyard , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which is taking place later this month .
the Bin Laden group did not publish any statements on the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also rebu@@ ked the group because of no current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s wholesale mos@@ que as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s .
the wre@@ ck of the crane came amid high winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people were hospit@@ alized .
government officials ruled that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the families of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q boss states that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled professionals from Eastern Europe has stepped up
this leads to the opening of 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen .
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q selling points throughout the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you apparently belong to a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing arti@@ sans to perform do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the hardware chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled professionals from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has in the meantime over@@ taken .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops dedicated to arti@@ sans and to close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were made by women .
at the moment , men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that have more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men working in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more strongly to a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ struc@@ ted her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has owned exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group failed to raise the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the state court of K@@ lagen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball Vice @-@ Master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he was acqu@@ itted in May of this accus@@ ation .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the District At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , it was clear that in the years 2006 @-@ 2011 the defend@@ ants used funds from association accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
he is har@@ n@@ essing the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also accused of financial failure .
this fact was eliminated by the chair of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
to blame for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen to the association .
the sports officials had only offset expenditure compens@@ ations and the Sport@@ club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of the debt - the liabilities caused some 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? , &quot; said one of the accused , in a bread @-@ based company of the financial officer .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money to put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made .
moreover , in case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of expense allowance had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one has paid a part of the expense allowance only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account .
therefore , flat @-@ rate and not detailed accounts also appeared , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes .
the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ ories administered the two accused together , the second defend@@ ant said .
the judge asked why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in details of the financial bore , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 , when investigations were launched against the public abuse investigations , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
that had been set@@ backs , the accused declared .
this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent had no answer to this for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage compensation ? , judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he had not agreed to this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With him you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he has never paid a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
at diets , he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants could not show exact documents for the early years .
they were no longer maintained after an audit in which everything was considered correct .
mil@@ eage also referred to the second defend@@ ant .
all the deport@@ ations were made in cash , and he had to travel from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement .
the main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the interview of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard supplies another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction , which has been ongoing for the past three years , the computer store will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the company .
the positions at the US Compu@@ terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
this means that costs in the amount of USD 2.@@ 7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.@@ 7 billion , which will be incurred from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs , which has been ongoing for three years , has not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
on the other hand , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent .
the company from the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto , California , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new company , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
another dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand of corporate customers after his services were the second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
as a result , revenues decreased to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only late responded that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man Restru@@ c@@ turing plans fores@@ ee the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly be reduced to rejection : 54 per cent said , 35 per cent said in favour .
the fact that other countries are air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria find 61 percent positive .
24 per cent , on the other hand , are to intervene in the conflict .
in cooperation with the Syrian authorities , B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of the respon@@ dents reject , 20 percent would be for it .
29 per cent couldn &apos;t decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
at the heart of the fair , networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility are at the heart of the trade fair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Connec@@ ting Mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organisers of the Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA expect some 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence break on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and wat@@ chers against several hundred refugees .
the Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police there was a police line , and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water laun@@ cher .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officers .
the officials initially set up pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn some time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had met the tear gas cried out .
other refugees s@@ cour@@ ged themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
the world is watching if the US central bank is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether interest rates are raised for the first time for nearly a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , which was the last week of the view that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest was set to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Senior Partner at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global relations .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 p.m. CE@@ T on Thursday
death Sent@@ ence at Delta State University left behind excuse letters
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social sciences at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency centre that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will not distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police in@@ quired the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I wanted I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she was married about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ ular Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway # 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , ran on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb obtained a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his life lau can be found on the University &apos;s website .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ res@@ sive years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer .
the actor is also supposed to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this surely calls for its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organization .
150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost work@@ space for the restructuring of the Group .
there are , however , new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and util@@ ises the budget subsidiary Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the re@@ orientation is to generate a profit contribution of some 500 million euros a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will no longer have a management board for the passenger business in the future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the executive board of Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
the new order under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organisation of the 120 000 strong company has been complex .
the airline companies operated under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with pilots
in the collective bar@@ gaining dispute with the pilot adjustment cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations after the court @-@ packed strike on this Thursday are to be resum@@ ed .
this divided the union .
the theme of the talks is to be the qui@@ escent control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wanted to produce viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilot , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is considering shifting routes to the company &apos;s own equity line of Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United cannot play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this brought the left outside defender to tears , and will shut him out for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg fra@@ il and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be transferred tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then it &apos;s fantastic and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a red card and the suspension of an i@@ vory .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al gu@@ essed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had er@@ red himself .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery starts now , I am coming back stronger . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until next June .
Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s very hard because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , who appeared in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , as it always seems to be a picture or a message we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , re@@ stores a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads .
as if this would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he is willing to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment , li@@ stens with the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , sn@@ app@@ y creature that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is devast@@ ated .
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row a child .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circle office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ on &apos;s staff , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly under threat from the exclusion of England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful outlook .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th fails from the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the course of Ly@@ th could have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
hopefully , if he hopes to make further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss already praised his attitude , even though he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is primarily a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th received seven opportunities - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first introduced Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I highly recommend .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but of course this depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and would get four Qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up , and I don &apos;t mind it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player .
mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred lashes and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him , he was very impressed as a young man .
people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt he was created for international cri@@ cket contest , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .

some won &apos;t agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy of heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = the UK &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u if the economy is in a dol@@ drums by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will get deeper into trouble every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour and the TU@@ C who fought hard because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend said recently that some member states are deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU , and not always on its own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split allow@@ ances and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ angers social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climbed up to summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes a Great Britain outside the EU tent , &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we will stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or sub@@ stitution in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may deliberately not intentionally plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did not support during the 1975 referendum that Tony Ben@@ n did , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990 &apos;s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ min@@ ting foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa you better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle behind the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly fl@@ aps on my back on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he had no time to waste for me - seems in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ber Ten@@ dency and the Wil@@ der Gef@@ il@@ ds of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father went on watching TV to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos; struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their conference on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ encing campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite bel@@ ungs economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C will not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in everything a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - in order to make concessions to the British if it can all be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , where I was reminded of something at the start on Monday , which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze public health report report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he founded his main conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the asser@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said a sponsor of the meeting was a company named Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained how to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes @-@ maker , but not the financing he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not provided , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lab@@ elled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the report report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; served &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every other lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what proves and not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die annually in a disease related to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
with the clear demonstration of recent evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former Head of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ ville and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard @-@ fought time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director Tony Hall said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in channel 4 without success .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent , which would also be clearly presented by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC .
if you would like to keep the broadcasting fee , which I do not consider to be a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least rely on programs that others do not do or put on commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time frame , because they want to achieve as much support as possible for their future .
the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it is ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax funding could be funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ender is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are re @-@ announ@@ cing what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ day gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that BBC shows should sell like East@@ er .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their apparent missions for justification of 4 billion pounds of broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that for 150 £ a year you get a great value here , but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 £ , wonder if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and maintain her Rei@@ thi@@ an mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain the public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of TV will be shown , and with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sounds of sound , which are for the human ear to high frequencies to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani stated that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then enter into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain in an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are visible at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : from September 15th to 18th with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) , one reads in the fon@@ ts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into an image of a tank .

the 300 posters are issued by artists who have exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in Bank@@ sys disp@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 pack of Allen keys , claiming that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops advertising space on the planet . &quot;

many artists work with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they must move outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters regards commuters in the subway .
the Am@@ nesty International was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works for free with the graphic artist and vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist .
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the We@@ ap@@ ons Fair - through a laying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ stering with bright colors and animation it remains strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture machines at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tom Davi@@ es von Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is an invasion of the British government and the guarantee that torture machines are not illegal before our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair comes from the area within the area of Ex@@ Ce@@ L where exhibitors taste fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student resi@@ dences
eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old into a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student halls reaches from slightly nerve @-@ induc@@ ing to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sh@@ atter : people tell wh@@ ence you are coming from , whether and where you took Sab@@ bat@@ ty , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were ign@@ ited and these fire extingu@@ ishers were .
let people go .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also places where people get dressed and put on their under@@ wear .

intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
their room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
since you start the university at the high point of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I made you something baked . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to talk and at the end perhaps associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chickens is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with a more balanced deal than my room@@ mate , who added a washing @-@ up liquid to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make a noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the saying belongs to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse .
a girl on my hall asked her neighbours if they were doing something , drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour examination .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would enter into the same residence ?
on the contrary , it would not be deeply embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to her , separate herself and see her every day and perhaps witness how she draws together all common friends ?
of course the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good strike is fun , but it takes only moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .

row houses for refugees , single parents , ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space but also the educ@@ ating mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are forced to push the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner hopes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people are left to a great deal here .
in view of the flood of refugees , we also need enough living space in the coming decades .
a very narrow , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you teach people in living blocks .
each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
the price of 160 square metres of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without plot .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have successfully crossed my project under construction law .
it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking space regulation particularly complicated .
gru@@ es@@ ome .
it still under@@ goes who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
definitely not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments that hardly can afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single educ@@ ating mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner .
I show you how to build cheap and well @-@ built today .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation because they receive an error message stating that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are recommended to wait either until the assault goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process has been completed .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the telephone may switch to half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only de@@ vot@@ ee : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup 2nd stressed before the start into the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from the title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve season races so far and takes the flood @-@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Br@@ ite was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the membership number to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the cure .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the sponsor of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which was chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot install the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search are to be pushed forward too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
district office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the centre of Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ists have joined forces under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consulting , you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation runs down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the count @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the purchasing market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing are immediately given information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of nursing and nursing homes .
for years , we have been working with our out@@ patient nursing staff that often care@@ gi@@ vers are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new owner Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ists and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ di complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ di stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre particularly in the demographic shift .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure indispensable in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also devoted itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as efficiently as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang passed away 92 years old

he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus left an honorary member and , at the same time , &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was said in the out@@ ings .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , intellectu@@ ally , he has not admitted .
Wiese was just cutting his hair in the Bremen city centre , when he saw how outside a car park guard issued a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the meadow ra@@ ged out of the business , insul@@ ted the officer and threw her the due fine of money in front of her feet , as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only afterwards I will decide whether the meadow will be shown or not .

men beat to 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 hrs there were three young men on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this time the group was at the level of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the teen@@ ager and hit the fist with his fist .
the victim suffered a breath of the nose and ble@@ ed heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dismissed from his sacrifice .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their apartment and demonstr@@ atively passed over there several times .
when the vehicle was no longer seen , the injured man went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
with the aid of a stroke @-@ stick , one rebu@@ ffs on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
up to now there is only a vag@@ ue description of the perpetr@@ ator .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second m@@ allet was about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller to practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ ausen .
also vel@@ vet citizenship Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice field breaks on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a point in the next few months .
after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises on St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us Street 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ do@@ ers met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently completing their vocational training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the garbage cans would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Müller liked the idea to practice one &apos;s own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and guide the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so they agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue living in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller has also grown up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior emergency doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K prepar@@ edness Stru@@ c@@ turing Vil@@ sen .
starting on 19 September , the new boss will be prepared for the practice .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ici@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a house @-@ doctor .
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the reconstruction the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler will receive a total of 50@@ 000 euros as part of a funding programme from the district ( 25,000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Saturday &apos;s mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients arrive in the field of Fel@@ low@@ ausen every quarter , in North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor could have found herself , she would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos; hour also continue to look especially in familiar faces : take over the seven health professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ fl@@ es .
with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ic@@ ausen , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness she already felt after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband is laughing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees by force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also going up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to submit a request for asylum is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia considers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - denied Slovenia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and could possibly establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy border surveillance - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the minister pointed out , Sloven@@ ians would not want to reconci@@ le its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must render its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police were able to attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles constantly meet new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it deals primarily with Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also in action .
in the coming days , his country counts with around 4000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would be re@@ directed to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were on the road all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could indeed result in a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive capabilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention the details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners consistently give a good certificate of what concerns the standard of border controls .
on Serbian side , there are still around 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to reports from the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm down Wednesday morning at a local evi@@ ction in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently act for very high refugee numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrant - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn in Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals that has been accused of having gained an insight into still un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wired and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der businesses should have been made in the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , according to the investig@@ ators , more than 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are said to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe .

keep track of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ ati@@ cal life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four large boards each with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce called attention to its 20th anniversary and is entirely confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and under the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Help is also available to pass@@ ers @-@ by for questions and talks like the volunteer workers .
while some pass@@ ant spontaneously sei@@ zes the chal@@ k and &quot; read my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; stop war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not suffer long &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others stay short , read , say phrases like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
again and again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , how to die with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ tia is the bearer of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public @-@ class action is good for the 20 year old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly to the tablets is understandable , but finally it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and death still remains with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up people .
an assessment shared by An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ dant is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce was looking for volunteers by calling , she immediately reported and had been there when it was founded in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the suffer@@ ers and their relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hos@@ pi@@ z St. Vincent .
all are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her job well with her experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , consider it precious and value the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the Amb@@ ul@@ atory E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .

F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial prospects lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reported dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered its profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ man service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year that will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set $ 10.@@ 84 .
despite higher price increases , the lower level of view is 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January , and despite higher allow@@ ances for bo@@ d@@ transportation of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expects the result to be increased compared to the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenues , and the growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid yields &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than those of the rival U@@ PS who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor force , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind 2,@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve analysts from Z@@ acks Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts in@@ quired analysts of $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex recorded a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , which caused sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent during bo@@ d@@ life , but the operating result was flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labour costs in the freight business .
in pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares dropped by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most expected conference in the years , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States is in danger of them at one end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ stor@@ eyed meeting hall .
the map is a reminder that F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the nation &apos;s economic interests before all other things .
the central bank has a double job from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices here st@@ ably .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday that the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the unprecedented stimulus from the near @-@ term short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data from the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and either by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they see , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Chief Econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the set , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts reduce the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she must go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interest rate raise would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that , despite the ail@@ ments of liber@@ als , that it would be necessary to make more economic progress , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world reached the end of last month after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell by more than 16 % below its peak in May when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would cho@@ ke global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , although the D@@ ow is now nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives the market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts the US economy and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint of Ben S. Bern@@ anke &apos;s former leader in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; her monetary expansion , triggered turbul@@ ences around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only super@@ v@@ ise developments elsewhere , but also consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ier , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest income , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited apparent impact on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis , such as the market re@@ unification of 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate deposit .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il doesn &apos;t come near that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of interest income because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not possible without the dedication of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .

Brazilian pedi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women on how important good nutrition is during lac@@ tation . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ oric intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy eating of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ard@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the contract for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
planning for the long @-@ awaited gym@@ nasi@@ um bau at Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Centre is progres@@ sing step by step : during the recent council meeting , the revised construction work was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
previously , the Panel had , among other things , adopted an application for a &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from a valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was about permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; semi @-@ roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; roof with a non @-@ central first and roof@@ top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems is the background of the planning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this brings together a wonderfully large South roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was again the roof @-@ ti@@ lt , which for energy reasons - unlike in the building plan - is to lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan does not allow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the roof @-@ cutting - whereby Bern@@ ol@@ den &apos;s municipal council usually de@@ vis@@ es more restric@@ tively in the case of exemp@@ tion applications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the field of gymnas@@ tics it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym hall at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated at around 2.3 million euros .
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ land transport .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the Board of Directors for the examination .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new Medical Director at the Hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is reflected in the surprising plans of the District of the County , which confirmed Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and it will be held on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change was initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who to succeed he came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses on the inside .
over the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees , will lead both houses , until next year the former hospital of the squ@@ ad , which still has more than 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed .
Land@@ rä@@ tin J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , counter@@ ed rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity would not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief doctor for over 30 years has not given it .
he had been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was again and again threatened by closure in the past decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

Jag@@ ast@@ ery@@ fall with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their corn harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police informed .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was not clear at first .
the crime police investigated .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who was missing from Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who was missing from Saturday , fell victim to a violent crime .
the funeral of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police informed on Wednesday .
as a tat@@ too , a 20 @-@ year old , also captured on Tuesday evening , is considered to be the case and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she hadn &apos;t come home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of the evening .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators initially met with the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was a suspicion against the 20 year old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities reported that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and laid the cor@@ pse in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be presented to the Harbour Cran@@ e on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators lay down the burden on him .
the further investigation is to take place over the closer circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns against lack of housing
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable housing .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
distribution disputes on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last paid homes .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this means that 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seekers in an initial residence .
many come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers used to rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany is shooting an apartment deficit that gets bigger from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ ,000 units have been missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities not necessarily in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in the &quot; Hotel Mum@@ my &quot; because of the loud noise on the housing market .
in large cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has been declining for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction .
in this way , the real estate tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats is suspended .
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are required , according to the Alliance .
the funding programme for Kf@@ W refugee camps is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros was obtained on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia turn into a corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary virtually no more is going through , as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb her@@ al@@ ds the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the liqui@@ dation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees are broken up to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports by the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
on the eve of the day Hungary had sealed its border for refugees .
new laws which came into force on the same day , moreover , make proper san@@ itation procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not encounter a border f@@ ences .
the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
after Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees following the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 un@@ challenged people .
shortly before gate closure on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws stages the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted prison sentences of up to five years and the deportation of the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up at the border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
13 families with small children and two elderly people are among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically no one has a chance to receive asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian views , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the reception camps in the border place was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only reaching a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced border controls .
around 20,000 migrants , however , remained in the country according to the government &apos;s instructions .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival we were busy with the clean @-@ up on Sunday , when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the ri@@ ver@@ ns along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the near Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we had the unexpected guests once more , with snacks and drinks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have said immediately , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was natural for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to don@@ ate a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers desc@@ ended on Sunday evening in W@@ els from one ICE to a regional train in direction of Passa@@ u , after the announcement that the railway traffic was stopped in Germany , but still to try the border .
however , the regional train was placed before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday , day before , a two @-@ year course sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp to establish structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has publicly and publicly bowed the position of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in view of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter to create decent conditions for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof Quar@@ ters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has all hands full with the support of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad became accustomed to his word weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to place quarters for the thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos at the first reception centre Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was no big vor@@ tex , said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; championship achievements . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Ministry of the Interior spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crisis @-@ like situation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Konrad sett@@ les with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation establishments have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be allocated to the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the national leaders .
they would have assured him of creating quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s fine in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and will be clari@@ fied as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum @-@ coordinator sets great expectations also in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen wie wir &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter .
yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that the credi@@ tors have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holders or the size of the overhead duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , establishes that he is more successful in contrast to the Interior Ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not give the Republic a cost as they themselves stated .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far , my own quest for arti@@ llery has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the suffer@@ ers are currently unable to accommodate these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
critics are critic@@ ised by the head of the city on the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders will not be sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) , on Monday , accentu@@ ated further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders will not be sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
for the time being , there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the prot@@ ectors would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now introducing controls on its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans for P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industry line is officially concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later on to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - why Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EUR 1.7 million was invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are en@@ quiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the Arctic
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually Jut@@ ta wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni to the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now increased the form of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the metropol@@ itan area of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who herself has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I feel most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women look into rap@@ ture when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert will not be able to answer with the last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s up to the fact that a nice bag is used for every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a village whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for up@@ sets .
whether he alien@@ ates himself from foreign policy , mani@@ f@@ ests journalists or reveals gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office is power@@ ing the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fres@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some in the 1200 inhabitants site is related via -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their c@@ aller @-@ city , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native of K@@ all@@ stadt filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump and the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit a big mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the en@@ co@@ ders , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the en@@ co@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;@@ sche success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated to the USA and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation of the real estate group was the first real estate purchase in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland in the long run failed at the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once walked away without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared the start of the movie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the occasionally distinctive say@@ ings of the descendants .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the American more distant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so start@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has never taken care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ er Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz @-@ family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally well anchored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who were sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ fried Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ at@@ ograph@@ ers , even in the US the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper @-@ Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the hands of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in Today &apos;s ratings .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broadcast by the federal capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the distance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise reached an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities compared to Today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today achieved a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number la@@ gged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sunrise has closed in recent months .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up until now in September , sunrise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ .000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect those Mor@@ ning people more than Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could play a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe in average 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 spectators and the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quotes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars , which failed to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have unknow@@ ingly obviously who wins The Bachelor .
the woman who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor was envel@@ op@@ ed in sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you might accidentally have issued an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the fin@@ als on Thursday
all three women have been in a ly@@ rical way about why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could their answers become the game destro@@ yer who won the Heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors .
je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams &apos;s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it was quite compatible and I thought it was throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands on the earth with both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well @-@ suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house made her clear last week that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally posted to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor &apos;s will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on 10 on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day late last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the ban@@ ker when he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ vert at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies from the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Hay@@ ne also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference .
the 49@@ ers Sports re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his depl@@ eted catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ent@@ our@@ age had hoped for its N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
all in all , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

due to the high refugee numbers , the free elec@@ tors demand the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools at the beginning of the F@@ W fall in Bavaria when there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get uph@@ eav@@ als in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free elec@@ torate ad@@ jour@@ ned until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees now domin@@ ates the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as it existed during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the free vot@@ er leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the Free Cho@@ ices as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also called for more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several states would not be consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria push@@ es off , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ lasting long @-@ lasting torch is on the order of the day : education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; intermediate level plus &quot; at 47 grammar schools where an extension of the upper secondary school of three to four years has been tested .
but that doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools we want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free drive at G@@ 9 anywhere , wherever desired .
moun@@ ts Wall Street helps Da@@ x to jump on the jumps
the German stock market has closed with profits following a long @-@ distance trend @-@ free and nervous trading process .
only in the afternoon was a firm start of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points .

in the US , the D@@ ow Jones Index recently recorded around 1 percent in plus .
many stock markets are expected to place the markets in place until after the interest rate decision in the US and also for the great decline in the fut@@ ures market .
the discussion about the costs arising from the nuclear ph@@ ase@@ out has temporarily pushed the shares of RW@@ E to record low and left deep traces at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies might lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government den@@ ounced the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered something , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .

according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; took effect from the weekend .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ aero@@ i district , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , while some of you threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber stor@@ eys , of which it is known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , evi@@ dently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the Mad@@ hes@@ i ethnic group say that new provinces , which are formed as part of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killed August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been ruled central for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature ha@@ sten@@ ed the trial after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ de Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned , but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den is planning to market around 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the Old Post Art Centre .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
which investor would be questioned is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts were concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Road , already a few months ago and the building on it would be torn off .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some of the residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their Freizei@@ tzentrum
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement near the small sea near Em@@ den are lying on the table .
the interest , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors right now .
the project has been deb@@ ating around ten to twelve million Euros for months .
violent reactions among the Meer@@ bus@@ dic owners who came to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An@@ li@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant block that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears as several other critics of the project that the traffic would increase greatly by the planned size of the facility : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus loads coming to be reck@@ oned with , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ trends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches campaign double donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double donations campaign to raise $ 11 million to humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mass@@ oud , a Google associate , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark platforms and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many flee from the war @-@ torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity Sur@@ gery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most of the studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight relative to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compared two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c screening - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was totally un@@ resolved and 28 % in part .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , the type of diabetes was reduced to only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol in general better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose levels of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , reflecting blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped by some 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the leading scientist Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching greater decreases in BM@@ I ( 7.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and marked a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die during the course of 15 years compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated the genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is delighted that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the inaugur@@ ation of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to Eth@@ ics Studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the end , we have to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never resolved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions following the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used force , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase in ing@@ es@@ tion of hand dis@@ infection by children over the past 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years who swallow high alcohol hand san@@ iti@@ zer , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years who report toxic control centres rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them end up in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children were deliberately drinking disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a test of courage in social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers are said to have bl@@ ended disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children get it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sy@@ ringe from straw@@ berry du@@ st@@ ard disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to an emergency department .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is considered drunk by an adult as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ apped her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors checked them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and pushed his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store wall disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases via alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing the disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients .
health authorities &apos; employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ m@@ ally &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to wall disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the preten@@ ded plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and pointed out disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in a rear @-@ end collision , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was slightly injured in a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver travelled to the industrial area on the cross @-@ gap and was too late to notice that two preceding cars had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ tor and pushed this car to a Ford Fi@@ esta .
damage to the vehicles involved resulted in material damage of around 10,000 euros , the police for@@ ks .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer willing to travel and had to be tow@@ ed .

lack of title competition in Scottish football dri@@ lls Nieder@@ länder - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers middle @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they don &apos;t show any highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the R@@ angers &apos; return .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian chef sw@@ ans to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ cre@@ tion from the Champions League , defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now clearly at the top of the table with five points lead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we &apos;ll come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel like that - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously in January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , suggest@@ ing that he made a few January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ Boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new entran@@ ces and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x @-@ Ka@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season period to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with reference guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years and did not abol@@ ish the drau@@ ght from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts set to S@@ FA battle because of N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 , when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field , and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the Defender was later repe@@ aled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not questioned my integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the incor@@ rigi@@ ble hi@@ bee was rebu@@ ked after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn from Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is certain to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ ya Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management team still has confidence in the management team to turn things up - but admit that the decline in the field has to end .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will get the guys back on track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to win over Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic on the upper edge of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ ach &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Inn@@ es : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in cups or le@@ agues , which games of this kind have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a reduction in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken troub@@ ling the process
as the security personnel were unable to paci@@ fy the situation , the employees called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray , the officials could put the stur@@ geon into custody .

why I Will C@@ ause an Ex@@ ek@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a bit later today , except for late legal action , I &apos;ll see a man is brought to death .
when it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I &apos;ll sit in an audience gallery in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ sy is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as seats , a mac@@ ab@@ ar lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong likel@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt of a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few metres away from a police officer who tried to &quot; sof@@ tly persu@@ ade him to return to the bank . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale called for a house peace break in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity section and claimed that she had conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions than it was about the positive cobal@@ t t@@ amp@@ er probe at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too much hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out suddenly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head raised , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them .
when they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before that , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity section had tried to spy out his stall .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I &apos;m going to name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I believe that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and maybe makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I am saying can now be considered .
but I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care about it , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , called the rac@@ use treatment rule &quot; laugh@@ able , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly took mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like that last night .
it could have been the whole day like that .
but it was the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy op@@ poses ri@@ vals due to claims for ring fighting
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster &apos;s coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said the refer@@ ees had allowed the Storm players &quot; ring battle &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co &apos;s coach Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team had reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ ir@@ rel of his team and said that they were only focused on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team gave him confidence as it meant that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy announced on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive system or the techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tac@@ tical a real centre of gravity , and that has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and obviously he has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this always occurs again and again at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their play was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a divorce suit .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters game achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against Cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t considered it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses , and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team is free this weekend , because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the pre @-@ final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery
a man who could possibly have a lifel@@ ong sentence due to his attempt to enter the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a $ 200,000 security deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security to achieve its release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ ous statements of the two people , it is clear that the issue of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Richter Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the circumstances that he for@@ gives his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police on a daily basis and atta@@ ches itself to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : Germany &apos;s cab tear@@ ing apart
a truck driver was seriously injured during a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had rem@@ anded in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to do@@ dge to the left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the crash @-@ causing driver &apos;s cab collap@@ sed completely .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logged in to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and instantly al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attorney E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction - that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people .
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions and did not appear before the court at a hearing on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg not to appear in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual offen@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab , argu@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is found in his crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to get background reports on social work .
in this case Ho@@ gg was given security deposit , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the judgment .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many locks left out of fear of discovery and arrest the people increasingly at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees were taken up in the Land@@ kreise Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot through bridges and bar@@ rage to the German side .
there they are picked up by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
more and more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station on Wednesday , compared to the start of the week on Wednesday .
some 700 people had arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 p.m. , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stuttgart : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drop@@ out awaited by tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air is currently circulating in the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was dra@@ gged from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ sea @-@ circle with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour can be expected .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
2015 is especially noticeable in the compact cars , which are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are in particular demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations have dropped to this segment alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , a lot of new compact models are introduced this year .
one of the premi@@ er premi@@ ers for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will stand by dealers in the fall .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel offers an introduction below the biggest competitor , VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost € 16@@ 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is already visible at the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra rival Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly sporting GT @-@ version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan extension wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
the compact infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , adap@@ ts fully to the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
according to manufacturer data , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; DS 4 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IA@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front part : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified lights with LED technology were re@@ drawn .
the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was recently modernis@@ ed in the interior , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the mounted Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court issued an ex @-@ prisoner of the detention facility Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel Department of Justice between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who is now on the free foot according to his lawyer , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his office in office because of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied conditions of detention against the Berlin country failed .
however , the Constitutional Court raised the verdict of the Court of Appe@@ al in Berlin and re@@ mitted the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hur@@ ts .
chamber court decides now on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons of the question@@ able period only a few days of imprisonment were decisive for the compensation , a compens@@ atory claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a worsen@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
in April they told a prisoner of in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity because he was locked naked in a cell .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy of human dignity .
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing for a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel fall in November 2009 .
the former pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated every day between 15 and 21 hours per day in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin prison pris@@ ons have also been hit the head@@ lines for lack of personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always locked up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to ra@@ ckets it should have been because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of offspring , 19 will fall off in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Interior , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ veness in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following overview provides an overview of what is available in Germany .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used every year - the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as is currently being built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental properties : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing from the rent price relationship annually fall out , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing needs to be created every year and the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and Federal Buil@@ ders agree that there will also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( IAB ) , 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them to get started , Claudia Walter critic@@ ises Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mig@@ rations@@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while there was earlier a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement to restrict the asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - the view is mostly seen that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
the lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle to access the labour market .
so far there is no adequate supply of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated through personal contact .
for this reason , the construction of networks is the king &apos;s path to labour integration , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt .
the Berlin school administration established that only a few fled parents give their children to Kit@@ as , estimated 10 to 15 per cent : &quot; it is only very important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration hand@@ outs are distributed in different languages .
should the demand for educ@@ ators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialized schools .
in the countries , students are prepared for classes with no knowledge of German in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , Be@@ ate St@@ okes says of the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state is forbidden to asylum seekers or have tolerated the study - the only exception has so far been Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a residence permit or an extension do not receive any benefits according to the asylum application Act more if they begin a study .
the latter generally do not receive a b@@ opp@@ y , since they do not fall under the circle of the citizens entitled to vote .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ o@@ gs , from January 1 , 2016 , this span shor@@ tens to 15 months .
but this gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get B@@ af@@ o@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ church law into a new state religion ratio .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organisation , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Mos@@ le@@ ms Central Council , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also need to change the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency for a decade and a general equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U mur@@ ders show systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive in the police and authorities .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &quot; organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and why international agreements like the anti @-@ racism convention promise Germany must become reality in the next few years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens want to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical care to the refugees that have been expected so far , Medical Director Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money is needed to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery claims to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers at the registration of health cards right away .
services provided could be settled later with the federal states .
and in the long run it is highly question@@ able to break so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum seekers act on .
otherwise , the doctors will mainly make the language barriers .
so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more aware of their diseases than other patients .
interpre@@ ters need to be taken over , not only in clinics , but also in medical practices .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more in@@ treated disabilities , and among young people , it is about HIV education .
with the partially other symptoms of disease , German doctors are coming from their training but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the don@@ or &apos;s don@@ or may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a sophisticated education system , many refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany is psych@@ ologically ill after estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or under depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study by the TU München shows that each fifth Syrian refugee child arrives trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , ser@@ ver@@ ers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites in the arena on a tile @-@ was@@ en to dream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , teacher and junior chef .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - this is the motto of the current stage production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for the am@@ ate@@ urs is the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take the people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the 27 @-@ year @-@ old juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktails with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst in his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , it wants to take up the Cuban duo loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
in addition to numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intuition and artic@@ ulation .
balance the wheel on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
sn@@ akes fascin@@ ate and at the same time fascin@@ ate .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
sixty employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the position of cir@@ c@@ uses are too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks at his position : &quot; if we are not doing well for our animals , we are not doing well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stro@@ king unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arti@@ stes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , is read off by the eyes after the possibility of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal doesn &apos;t feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena either .
the upper@@ most commandment : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always do our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites every day from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday , the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe Robert Mu@@ gabe maintains the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the statements made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , they had proclaimed and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists in Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the affected Parliament members that immunity in the Parliament is ending and as soon as they leave the Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard to disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will divide into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts result in a strain of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , saying HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ riv@@ alled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; thus an explanation of the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage was named &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring in order to cope with the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers have to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation went according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 they have been one of the two Premier League clubs that have experienced the most vulnerable stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability will last during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins its champi@@ ons league season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign started in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured at the Richter scale of 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and is driven by far @-@ reaching hopes to lead the association to his first European apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked out at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar accounts in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , as suicide rate among young men prove at a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends first , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently said , money can really not buy happiness .
the beautiful thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football watching in com@@ fy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely relate to it , even though they often stop trying to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telephone pastoral care told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ mitting suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria is making his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass over to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani stopped course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League de@@ but@@ ts as PS@@ G player who led the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a header in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities before the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed even though there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not scored another or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , he passed over nicely into the long corner of the grid .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , it was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who kno@@ cked the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field , a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pp &apos;s post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ len@@ ecks and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ atz@@ ed alone in the first half in no less than five attempts only after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his team@@ mates into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shooting , which was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours stamp thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth Se@@ as@@ el after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a lef@@ tist flan@@ k from Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back in the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which does not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

the London registered company Gl@@ en@@ core said in a statement that it sells new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with declining commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .

the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 1,@@ 60 P@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ stock sales as part of the more extensive plans to pay around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns about long @-@ term growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four times champion league winner , twice champion league champion , twice champion league champion , twice world@@ champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already standing before the 2008 European Championship before the departure from Barcelona .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Madrid won anything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rum@@ bl@@ ity wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is now working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns Spiel@@ zeit was running with X@@ av@@ i in 2008 / 2009 .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it in filling the film and not in filling the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said first .
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te , who is beaten by her white dog col@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People was campaig@@ ning for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter users expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et has earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter made national action and forced legis@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured people .
in February , the singer Prince made a recording on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album quiet matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the presentation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition show , which had just completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten up to the fin@@ als .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in full three seconds , which made him a winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than 10,000 dollars or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , filming will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers pass by Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the T@@ wins have made a chance to ascend within one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said tig@@ ers Manager Brad Er@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inner ings , then in the sixth and then again ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and made three runs possible .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish strongly this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely focused .
the designed tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit play by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the background at the end of the seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ h@@ anders Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy passed down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run rift at the right @-@ handed drummer of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a Double Play
after Detroit joined the Insurance Run at the end of the ninth year , wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ do and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ h@@ ander , however , st@@ ach S@@ ano with three pitches for his fifth save .
Detroit benefited at the opening of the game by an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two cour@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been removed from the injuries list before the game after he had been missing for more than a month because of a spinal cord .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ush gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who achieved a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 winning stre@@ ak with runner @-@ up in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed to run another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the tig@@ ers laid down in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor said .
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , did not score points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the list of injuries since mid @-@ August , should be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP will scra@@ m@@ ble Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to compete against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he had been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the different thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective bar@@ rage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago we had been glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , after Hungary no one will be sent back .
even Germany did not send back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , there have already been discussions between the Director General for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their aim is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit next week .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers will want to take a new start to the binding distribution of additional 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
in view of the strong refugee movement in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial absorption and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection also complain .
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could be secured with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from going to Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had gone through the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of more migrants have been on their way to the Greek border .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers presented their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technical sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even longer it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds that sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama missing several weeks 1860 München
the 1860 @-@ year @-@ old Munich needs to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an examination showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced .
R@@ ama had compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich Leo the diagnosis means &quot; probably four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ on loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper , with a view to the possible commitment of a s@@ ini@@ ster professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ability to prove its ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Ru@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training after his conc@@ ussion coming week .
the Austrian national player is expected to enter the running training on Thursday .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf ( 0 : 3 ) in a violent clas@@ h at the head .
contrary to his initial fears , he remained without a severe loss of blood .
no fruit diet - man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to be mind@@ ful of their slim line will often fall away from them .
man@@ gos contain relatively high amounts of sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : they contain B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone tells nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and should be consumed within a few days .
then of course they taste pure or in sweet foods .
but a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hearty dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ea and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .
the US parcel service U@@ PS returns up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company has already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
especially drivers are being sought .
last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce to 9@@ 5,000 temporary staff for the holiday season .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year in order to be ready for the Christmas business .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel service .
first fo@@ eh@@ n @-@ tower , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night on Thursday , the F@@ öhn blows partly with storm @-@ strength through the fo@@ eh@@ orn @-@ valleys .
on Thursday morning we will cross a marked cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature drop .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the side of the Alps on the night on Wednesday the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up to Thursday morning in the leaflets of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn stops in places to the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even or@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my hair dri@@ es for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow away at the hill@@ side .
rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum , in the next 48 hours , in total , more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the next 48 hours , which has already fallen in large rainf@@ all over the last few days .
on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn stops the air , as a result a cold front rolls with strong , partly spir@@ ited rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind will dev@@ our strong winds until stor@@ my , and the temperatures clearly go back .
the following days are presented in the north with 15 to 20 degrees Celsius . in the south , however , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
just under 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was baptized in the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honored as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in secret their faith for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , it becomes visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
at that time , he perceived the city as a deca@@ ying sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the ab@@ dic@@ ation .
hammer Artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt drew for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 different motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Old has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics like cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ land .
the same applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and thus translated into current inter@@ relationships .
these texts are like a verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who is expressing his very personal thoughts on the particular situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to have a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict protest@@ ant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was education already with the cane &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work in order to be able to carry me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to help the art again in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertising today , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is displaced .
artists have a different lust and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants viewers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into the images , let them work , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image seeks its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old have not taken care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , even mysterious themes .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn is approaching
plans made , place found , companies t@@ asked , gro@@ unding Hill for a round course model@@ ed : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn , it was already finished .
failures in politics and administration resulted in land@@ ings , especially among residents who did not want to tolerate the railways .
so hills de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be received in October , the First Shar@@ eholder Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees by 2019 and the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign for the weekend .
football responds to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and ensures its help in tac@@ kling the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can tell in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the decisive turn@@ outs must face politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , the German Football Association has extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
this weekend , the 36 professional clubs will be setting up a clear sign when they will carry out the &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left side of the tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama attracts everyone , no one is allowed to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can make football coaches , no , we have to use our beam strength , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ offen@@ heim managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on Friday the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Cup in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach called for the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had started their own projects would be great .
it is just as great that small and smallest associations are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government will provide 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of the SAP SE loses an eye in the event of accident
according to several reports , the Chief of the Board of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye through a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell to a water glass after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed , fain@@ ted , then he got out of the street - that he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we met in front of the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is present at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully functional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren sho@@ oter Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from skir@@ mish ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore arrives at the night race in Singapore on the weekend as less as a reserv@@ ist for the two regular pilots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
soccer : Bv@@ B without ra@@ eus vs. Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus have definitely been sm@@ ashed in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 : 00 / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ kel will not only alter its trunk position on the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Chief Apostle Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soccer teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in all European league games in the future , Tu@@ chel left open .
with high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by fellow players R@@ eus , that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , keeps mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl understandable : &quot; with that Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a pioneer in the change of car technology .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the Edge of Motor Show IA@@ A of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with industry representatives at the IA@@ A .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses , among other things , the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a quick move to digital radio communication .
a test track is currently being tested on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to prevent the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal framework conditions and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only fores@@ ees people as a driver .
in automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically feasible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should not wait until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 estimated the value added in driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
the Germans are still looking skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
the result is that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be able to prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent believe that 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed reach 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis championship
from September 25 to October 4 , Düsseldorf , the Düsseldorf @-@ based company will only open its doors to the single @-@ se@@ ater .
the final decision will be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said national trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship in China .
the 34 year old German Master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who guides the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the European Championships in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , has become the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly overlooked work of the man who wrote the fashion story without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
the show is not chron@@ ologically structured , but it is a perfectly choreograph@@ ed overall art work for which a lot of effort was spent : to fro@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers incar@@ n@@ ated 14 tonnes of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leder@@ h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashionable Geh@@ versuche of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the throwing of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier said in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first fashion show he could not pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of a curtain - P@@ lau@@ en lace as a fashion niche
it used to be on the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tops were created in a large quantity for customers , for example , to refine them to ceilings and she@@ ers .
this alone is no longer working today , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ dena P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en lace fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans on past styles is an increasing order potential .
anyone who does not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ dest@@ ein P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien along with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been depl@@ eted .
private specialty shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays the mass commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively through chains .
exports are also weaker , currently in Russia and in the United States .
so there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery industry in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger regional office of the Z@@ wick@@ au University of Applied Sciences - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically above all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball tip .
at the same time , the machine st@@ okes little spheres at some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was able to do nothing with traditional pl@@ um lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewellery .
in an elaborate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
she also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ ums and surroundings and who want to remember a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not supposed to touch , but Disney still dar@@ es to make a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not a new movie but a kind of continuation that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group commissioned to steer the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should campaign to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border control policies , the promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , to take up private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabit@@ ant milking system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created which identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of great importance since it has a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a legal business environment and more open to the market , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also enti@@ tle control over the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part as reported in a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double the limit of mercury in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double limit the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and to allow consumers a significantly higher dose of the ven@@ om .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has an appropriate paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full impact on pregnant and small children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury each kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury that around 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the proposed maximum values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ all is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish over the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts of especially in un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its home page with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health endanger@@ ment of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants em@@ bodies more than six tonnes of mercury in the year according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , European warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
