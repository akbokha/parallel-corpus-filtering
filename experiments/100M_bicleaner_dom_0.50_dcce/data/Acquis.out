B ) This agreement will remain in force for so long as the States Parties to the Treaty are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to set the procedures applicable to the implementation of the provisions of part I on the precau@@ tionary measures as necessary .
the aim of the preventive measures laid down in this agreement is the timely detection of significant quantities of core material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bo@@ ils for unknown purposes and the deter@@ rence of such a branch by the risk of early detection .
to enrich the target set specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a precau@@ tion of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the investigations by the organization is provided by an explanation , in which for each material balance zone the material quantity is not specified for a certain period of time , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified Me@@ gen .
in carrying out their investigations , the organization makes full use of the safety system of the community after article 3 .
the accounting and control system for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
in the application of their preventive measures , the Community will make use of the procedures and measures of the following manner and , as far as necessary , anticipate how they are closer to the supple@@ mental agreements and are expe@@ dient :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of recovered , produced , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock volumes ;
B ) the evaluation of the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , testing and evaluating differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) procedures for the assessment of accum@@ ulations of un@@ measured assets and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which has the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock , including the one - and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and arrangements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) If ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ orium material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , the Community of the Organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is in@@ stituted for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of the fuel production or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other securing measures described in this Agreement .
a ) The precau@@ tions envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . however , if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is not permitted or requested from resi@@ dues arising from resi@@ dues , so the organization and community should consult each other about the use of suitable securing measures .
B ) The precau@@ tions envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the pre @-@ requ@@ is@@ ites mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community unanim@@ ously determine that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is rede@@ em@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards if the total amount of core material liberated in the States is at no time more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight by enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment , which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if liberated core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , subject to the securing measures pursuant to this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for the re @-@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the community meets with the organization supple@@ mental agreements , which is required in the scope that is required for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this agreement , in detail as to how the procedures defined in the Convention are to be applied .
the supplementary agreements may be extended or changed without amend@@ ment of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supple@@ mental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the take @-@ over between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the organization will set up a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material in the states , regardless of its origins , and will continue to carry out this inventory list based on the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action program fixed at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization alig@@ ns a special account under the name &quot; Special transaction &quot; which consists of funds that the Member States are contributing to the Special Trade Account under this Agreement ; this account is referred to as &quot; administrators &quot; by the organization , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state , which at the request in the currency of the respective state shall be paid to the organization as the administrator of the special transaction tax and to be deposited at the organisation &apos;s deposit in the country concerned .
B ) Payment shall take place in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement , or to another between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contract to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the E@@ EC and the Administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every Member State may , if desired , make payments in front of the above mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator receives approximately proportional divi@@ den@@ ds to cash or the school esh@@ ad@@ ow in order to cover expenses for the transaction loans and to balance the transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the E@@ EC :
III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and trend of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional loan capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ counted ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ ectable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices that apply for the funds financed by the Organization , and under the letter b ) the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement is to be taken into account .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which has been approved in the course of a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
aside from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms that apply to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years in each case .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization they hold .
any transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the funds is specifically indicated .
the proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services ( i ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and according to what the administrator has specified at the time of the loan granted , recipient of a special transaction loan .
re@@ payments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches until full disclosure of all special transactions the E@@ EC concerning the proposals and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors in preparation .
during the time of the re@@ payment of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the car@@ et@@ aker transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization , a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement of the external audi@@ tors of the organization on this account conclusion .
after paying out the special transaction loan , the manager of the E@@ EC will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are based on the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out from the account and the deposits paid to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker lead up to the complete edition of the means of the special transaction account from time to time , an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction , the progress of the programmes financed through special transactions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not in force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization may agree , the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it are due immediately .
if the total amount of funds paid by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires permission from the Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States acc@@ use the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the procedures concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the Reg@@ ular approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .
this agreement will be effective and will take effect on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications during the organization .
this agreement is written in two tran@@ scrip@@ tions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wor@@ ding equally binding .
considering that the agreement in the form of a letter to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN nuclear community , called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the project JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation will be transferred to a joint venture following chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Tre@@ aties - herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; common company JET . &quot;
Switzerland has been working with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since until the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion still requires extensive work , it is in the interests of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summari@@ ze their respective efforts in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to speed up their respective research projects which have reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis -
this agreement will enable any contracting party to achieve the greatest possible benefit by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and consequently the common objective of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective electricity generation by using the controlled fusion reaction to achieve faster .
to achieve the goal of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Program &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or changed after examination by the organs mentioned in articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that may include new activities that are relevant to the Eur@@ atom program .
each time the contractual parties accept a new program , this will be replaced by the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II to the present agreement .
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realised through : - reasonable participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- The exchange of personnel under the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated Third Parties , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom Program ;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
as part of the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the project JET .
in view of the association envis@@ aged in article 2 section 1 of this agreement , the parties signing an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those referred to by the Commission and the States and entities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective Eur@@ atom reserves the concern that Switzerland , with the time of entry into force , particip@@ ates in the agreement on the promotion of the human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the participation in the project JET , Switzerland is part of the joint company JET , with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , whose constitution it accepts .
Eur@@ atom is also concerned that Switzerland can become contract partner of any contract whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with the execution of the association designated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
in particular , the association agreement must include the sub@@ stitution of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of the research work and to steer the best possible results in line with the goals of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by at most two delegates in the connection group used as part of the Eur@@ atom program - in the following &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all issues relating to current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , is responsible for all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and alig@@ ns their T * in the interests of the two parties to the common objective in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme as well as on the common objective specified in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the consultation groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom Program , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities seek .
the advice groups that submit the VG research proposals to the extent that the funds granted for the Eur@@ atom Program are the best possible scientific results , take this task as to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement .
as part of the Eur@@ atom Program , Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the laboratories involved .

in particular , it provides the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss programme .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all the coordination committees deployed within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program .
the coordination committees , which provide the best possible use of the resources , the personnel and the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Program , take up this task in the respective field with regard to all research and development work , which fall under the present agreement .
BA@@ F is responsible for the core and energy research representatives of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country .
on the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission regarding the implementation of the program and any changes in the directions as well as the preparation of future programmes and the establishment of its overall size , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of fusion .
the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the management committee , the advis@@ ers and the coordination committees have an advisory capacity .
the statement of the VG for the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of human resources exchange .
the representatives of the two parties cooperate in the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative committees that are created for the purpose of the present agreement .
the Swiss financial contribution on the Eur@@ atom Program in accordance with this agreement is fixed on an annual amount to which Eur@@ atom &apos;s share of the cost of the Eur@@ atom program is at the same rate as the gross domestic product from Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
concerning the project JET , this financial contribution is related to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common business as soon as this is established .
moreover , Switzerland is presenting an amount to the Common Enterprise JET , which is to be defined in accordance with the provisions of the stat@@ ute of this common company .
the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom contributes to the financing of work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used for the calculation of Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the work carried out on the basis of the corresponding contracts .
the Commission shall inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount is intended to cover the expenditure in the framework of the Eur@@ atom Programme for the year in question .
the Federal Council pays the commission the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before 15 .

the extension is valid for the duration of the new program , which will be replaced by the Eur@@ atom program described in Anne@@ x I . this agreement is considered not to be termin@@ ated if there is only delays in the adoption of another Eur@@ atom program .
prior to every decision on the adoption of a new Eur@@ atom program , the contract parties are consul@@ ted within the articles 5 to 10 and articles 16 named organs of the present agreement .
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time with a period of six months .
in the form of a letter exchange to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in addition , in order to simplify the procedure for adaptation of customs tari@@ ffs in the event of renewed changes to the tari@@ ff tari@@ ff of one of the contractual parties in the future , it is further indicated to include an article 12 up to the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the agreement of the Community on these changes , and propose you an appointment for entry into force 1 . January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the prot@@ esters .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your current letter with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the prot@@ esters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the member states &apos; demands in the context of medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could conclude stand @-@ by @-@ loan agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount paid by the credi@@ tor land to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units of accounting ; this corresponds to 50 % of the member states &apos;s future delivery fund .
already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be prepared .
with every stand @-@ by @-@ credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without having exceeded a total of five years .
in the opening of the loans and in case of any extension the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening fee .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw will not be made before the end of one month after the conclusion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies at the disposal of the BI@@ S , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be dealt with considering the funds of the bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those which the BI@@ S applied at the respective time on under similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely match the market rates .
if the BI@@ S must obtain the necessary funds on the market itself , then the interest rate coming to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin increase .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
I honor to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep - and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties have agreed as follows :
- fresh or cold h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure a proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina obli@@ ges to ensure that the amount agreed in the annual amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
should a change in the offer form be changed as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the above @-@ mentioned committee in order to find an appropriate solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the Community takes advantage of the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the community market regulated by this agreement will not be affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the event that the Argent@@ ine imports exceed the agreed amounts in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the imports from Argentina for the rest of the year .

at the entrance of new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the number 2 set down in accordance with the scope of Argent@@ ine@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the instructions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is taken into account under the number 5 ho@@ of rate of the exhaus@@ tion .
the total amount mentioned in the number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed volumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets provisions so that the he@@ el of intervention conditions on frozen meat does not under@@ mine the sales of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other support measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs only takes place at prices and conditions that are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Argentina guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by placing export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products referred to as Number 1 .
in its part , the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is based in Argentina on the presentation of an export license , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details of the use of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the goods in question may be wai@@ ved .
in implementing provisions , it is further stipul@@ ated that the responsible Argent@@ ine@@ an authority in the competent authority of the community should inform the amounts in regular intervals for the export lic@@ ences ; this information may be en@@ capsul@@ ated by country of destination if necessary .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and runs smoothly .
he regularly reviews the Ten@@ dency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including conditions that are of importance to the goal mentioned in the number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that articles made of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out according to the Community .
the committee discusses all questions arising from the execution of this agreement and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall be without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount specified under the number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 January .
the amount reported by the entry into force by 1 January of the following year will be set in proportion to the total annual amount and will take account of the seasonal character of the trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied for the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be verified by both parties before 1 April 1984 in terms of changes that they consider necessary to be deemed necessary .
I would be grateful if you would like to express your government &apos;s approval .
I honor to confirm the entrance of your today &apos;s letter with the following wor@@ ding :

I honor to take on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep - and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties have agreed as follows :
- fresh or cold h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff zone 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ;
- frozen h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff zone 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are determined by the community to the following annual amount :
in order to guarantee a proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure that the amount agreed in the course of the annual amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
should a change in the offer form be changed as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the above @-@ mentioned committee in order to find an appropriate solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the Community takes advantage of the safeguard clause , it is committed to ensuring that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the community market regulated by this agreement will not be affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the event that the Uruguay &apos;s imports exceed the agreed amounts in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end the exports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of the products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ of rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with Uruguay has changed the number 2 set down in accordance with the scope of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the instructions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this is taken into account under the number 5 ho@@ of rate of the exhaus@@ tion .
the total amount mentioned in the number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed volumes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets provisions so that the he@@ el of intervention conditions on frozen meat cannot be under@@ mined because of the implementation of the regulation the sales of Urugu@@ ay@@ an sheep . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other support measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs only takes place at prices and conditions that are in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular by placing export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products mentioned in the number 1 .
the Community , in its part , comm@@ its itself to make all the necessary provisions , so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is based in Uruguay by the submission of an export license , which is given by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in implementing provisions , it is further specified that the responsible ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals fet@@ ches the amounts for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; this information may , if necessary , be en@@ capsul@@ ated by country of destination .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and , on the one hand , the provisions of the treaty on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Uruguay on the other .

a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or other substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ters are measured through ever renewed di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined on double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by volume of blood cell in@@ filtration in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , activity is expressed through time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set international standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood group regulation , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are worked out at the time standards .
according to definition an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The efficacy of re@@ agents for determination of blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ filtration .
the ti@@ ters indicate the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series where micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the Tit@@ ration of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in International units ( see Bul@@ letin of WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B S@@ eren contain according to definition 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens serum Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Standard Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; Anti @-@ A Re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy tests .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no humidity can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ oric acid during a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the responsible state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) will add an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the conditions for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , in@@ different , whether in fluid form or after recovery , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents needed for the international exchange of blood type determination shall not be arti@@ ficially colored , at least as long as it is not until an international agreement has come into effect on a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood type determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records on all stages of production and checks of the re@@ agents for blood type determination .
proper rehear@@ s@@ als of all re@@ agents can be stored for so long from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood type determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to their effective proportion in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain any substance of human origin .
on each individual container , a black @-@ and @-@ white label is to be attached in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for the recovery solution ,
