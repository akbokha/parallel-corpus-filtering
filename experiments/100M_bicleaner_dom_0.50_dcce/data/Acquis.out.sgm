<seg id="728">Based on the initial report outlined in Article 62, the organization will set up a summarized inventory of the entire core material in the states, regardless of its origins, and will continue to carry out this inventory list based on the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action program fixed at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the organization have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization aligns a special account under the name "Special transaction" which consists of funds that the Member States are contributing to the Special Trade Account under this Agreement; this account is referred to as "administrators" by the organization, only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non-interest notes of the member state, which at the request in the currency of the respective state shall be paid to the organization as the administrator of the special transaction tax and to be deposited at the organisation's deposit in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment shall take place in two instalments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after entry into force of this agreement, or to another between the EEC and the caretaker agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contract to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Every Member State may, if desired, make payments in front of the above mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator receives approximately proportional dividends to cash or the school eshadow in order to cover expenses for the transaction loans and to balance the transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the granting of these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and trend of the country's debt service and its additional loan capacity to loan conditions without discounted; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expectable development program or project (including a sectoral plan), irrespective of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization or not, according to the procedures and practices that apply for the funds financed by the Organization, and under the letter b) the preamble to this agreement is to be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization which has been approved in the course of a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Aside from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment terms that apply to the development loans granted by the organization; they are thus refundable in 50 years in each case.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are repayable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization they hold.</seg>
<seg id="750">Any transaction loan is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in which the source of the funds is specifically indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services (i) in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and according to what the administrator has specified at the time of the loan granted, recipient of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Repayments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state shall be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker teaches until full disclosure of all special transactions the EEC concerning the proposals and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors in preparation.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of the repayment of the special transaction loan, the caretaker teaches the EEC four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">The caretaker transmits the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization, a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement of the external auditors of the organization on this account conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="756">After paying out the special transaction loan, the manager of the EEC will send a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, which are based on the accounts payable to the account and the amounts paid out from the account and the deposits paid to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the caretaker lead up to the complete edition of the means of the special transaction account from time to time, an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction, the progress of the programmes financed through special transactions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not in force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, which the EEC and the organization may agree, the agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting from it are due immediately.</seg>
