this document is a summary of the European Public evaluation report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ ling thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psychological condition in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal mood ) alternating with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have approached the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used to take one or the enam@@ el tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adapted to patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed mainly as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms was examined in three studies of up to one year .
efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that led to increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , over twelve weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , to prevent recur@@ rence , compared to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder leading to increased un@@ rest using Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution for intake ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15@@ mg , showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms than patients receiving placebo .
in the application to treat bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
moreover , up to 74 weeks Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled tick ) , trem@@ ors ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , bl@@ urred vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , nausea , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to serious man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorders and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients with predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes coinci@@ ded with the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were out@@ weighed against the risks .
furthermore , the committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in case of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transmission disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ thi@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle , and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
considering the joint offering of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks to the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose level before starting the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ acryl@@ ate / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ V pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ acryl@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this medicine may not be used in pregnancy because of insufficient data for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned to use dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole received a reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ ger@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term endurance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliberate over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without any death sequences .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is no information on the effectiveness of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plas@@ map@@ ry binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance over the combination of a partially antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ P recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for the dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients , who maintained a response to the study medication , were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and half @-@ operated dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than half @-@ surgery .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 or 13 % of the evalu@@ able patient data sets ) , a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a proven efficacy against placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo @-@ superior efficacy in week 3 and a substantial effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms that partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation stage before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ sion of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop@@ up @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in patients with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in doses or expos@@ ures that have clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , thus they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ sensitive adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ cor@@ de carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al cor@@ t@@ omas / carcin@@ omas at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the mean and 11 times of the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics were compared to 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as a solution for taking 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of det@@ ect@@ ability and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be termin@@ ated and begun with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical condition taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in case a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy processed tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution for inclusion .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al problems caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transmission disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ thi@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ging was greater compared to the one @-@ off of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study conducted in healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as one @-@ off input intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and which received at the same time lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The h@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites , compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after setting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose level before starting the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ging was greater compared to that after all@@ otted by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients was placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term endurance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution combined with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of ast@@ er@@ titude / behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and behavi@@ our@@ al disorder , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms in relation to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ ine reference arm .
the mean improvement of the bas@@ eline at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients , who included a response to the study medication , were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary educational objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than half @-@ surgery .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction of the rel@@ ap@@ se rate , which was found at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , increased weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms that partially did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study enlargement in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation stage before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % greater than the AU@@ C after the dose of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time for achieving maximum plasma levels was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) were above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects have only been observed in doses or expos@@ ures that have clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical use .
effects included a dose @-@ dependent side kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ cor@@ de carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1- to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to an ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ times of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in exclusive administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
if only the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments for metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in their blood prior to treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with which the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ axel medicines , it was not necessary to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who fail first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not shown for standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment ( see also Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 the treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of doses adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies involving patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have essentially other pharmac@@ ological features than other types of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in patients , no re@@ trac@@ ting of the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment courses should be initiated , until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas a clearly indicated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not detected , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case patients have nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or for women in child@@ bearing age who do not have effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is essential .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised against the treatment of a sperm con@@ serving as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very often ) and gi@@ dd@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and significant incidents of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al phase III clinical trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most eye @-@ catching important ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 lists the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate in blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in context in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency were possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ ig@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active substance that promotes the contra@@ ction of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by blocking their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 Alb@@ inal receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation appears in the tumor area .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ related trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy alone , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % because of metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to the progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients experiencing a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline based on the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Acc@@ ording to the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane on patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi @-@ phase manner .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates an extensive extra@@ vascular distribution and / or soft binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel after intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after a solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ axel injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported to be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value of the total dose was 4 % of the total dose associated with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
however , only a few data is available for patients aged over 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and bright light for over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as in other potentially toxic substances , care should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion fluid is inj@@ ected into a water bottle of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
after full en@@ core of the solution , the water bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ y@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values , in which complications may arise in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion if a blood don@@ or is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may be expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a blood donation , ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter for adults , respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be monitored before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by a ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency , or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
after administration , Ab@@ y@@ amed was compared to a V@@ ene in a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from ren@@ al problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Ab@@ y@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the start of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients who suffered from an an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / d@@ L of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ y@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , p@@ ung@@ ent mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
fl@@ y@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that , in accordance with the regulations of the European Union , it provided evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ y@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted to the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a permit for the placing of ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who received chemotherapy and the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia following chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , with planned larger surgical interventions ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
in order to reduce foreign blood , ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in adults with an adult without an iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients , where the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and as a result may vary depending on age , sex , and overall disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required .
a rise in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in light of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b @-@ value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b @-@ value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and subsequent complications may vary depending on age , sex , and overall disease burden ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required .
in light of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required to control an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes is increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ tes &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week .
if after four weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes is increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned blood vessels is required , were received in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Ab@@ y@@ stre@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the cycle .
patients who are diagnosed with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin at a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a stre@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina ( ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ) , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ lies ) .
in patients who are not eligible for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who do not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , adju@@ v@@ ant or underlying diseases ; patients with recently established heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effectiveness , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / d@@ l. a month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the actual causes should be determined and the common causes of non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ zing toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the synthetic u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ te index ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row can be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ y@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ id @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit associated with the administration of epo@@ et@@ ines if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control an@@ a@@ emia and prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be considered ( patients who have to be trans@@ liter@@ ated ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adapted to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ic an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk weighing under the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients with a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cul@@ ature could exist for patients with an initial ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that in patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia they can improve overall survival or reduce the risk of progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies of tumor tissues no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular occur@@ ren@@ ces such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ a@@ em@@ ias , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , dor@@ sal thro@@ mb@@ oses , dor@@ sal thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arity ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , patients with cardiovascular disease may come to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the biotechn@@ ologically extracted epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and is identical with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 others ) .
1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 17@@ 4 gy@@ nec@@ ological tumours , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tumours and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts .
survival and progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed an un@@ clari@@ fied , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than in the controls in the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value less than 13 g / d@@ l. , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no stimulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal experimental studies with approximate 20 times of the recommended daily dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced fö@@ tal body weight , dela@@ ying the Os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports are based on in vitro fer@@ til@@ isation with cells from human tumor tissue samples , but are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

during the treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which is reg@@ ressed in further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of the treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solving red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before starting therapy .
very rarely has been reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y after mon@@ e@@ o- to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y , it will break off your treatment with se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ y@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
in case of increased or increasing levels of potassium , your doctor may take into consideration an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically open coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a specific value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not ha@@ sten the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your red blood dy@@ es ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your stre@@ amed dose accordingly to keep the risk of blood cl@@ oning ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be very carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are cancer patient , remember that ab@@ se@@ amed will act like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumor .
if you have a bigger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before treatment starts and treated accordingly .
if your red blood cell &apos;s values ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ y@@ amed since there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines / have recently taken / applied it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ y@@ amed , your doctor may arrange specific blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are the means to build up the immune system , such as cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a specific value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ y@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like falling down ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle prior to the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches .
in order to treat the disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for assessment of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
the first study involved nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years of hip frac@@ ture , and the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two trials to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients with ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis medication ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most Ac@@ la@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to phen@@ o@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion area and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Ac@@ la@@ sta manufactures information for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information on how to use the medicine , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package insert • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Requi@@ rement of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When it comes to medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium to ensure at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and adolescents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data on safety and efficacy are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is to be treated with ac@@ la@@ sta due to sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ en@@ ronic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary and sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium to ensure at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium twice a day , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( bad oral hygiene ) should be examined with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
for patients who need dental treatment , no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area .
clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of cases reported as serious side effects of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation in patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ en@@ ronic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which expressed itself as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of ren@@ al failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values that were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the patient &apos;s disease @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on the avoid@@ ance of frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in a large clinical trial , local reactions to the in@@ fusion location , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , were reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was occasionally reported , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extra@@ ctions or other dental attacks .
7 Pati@@ ents with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw@@ s of a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a patient treated with placebo .
in the event of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric frac@@ tures of the spine were significantly reduced over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % lower risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta had a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase of bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , total hip by 6.@@ 0 % , lower than 5.1 % and dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vic bone one year after the third annual dose .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone @-@ volume and the retention of tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 intervals during duration of study .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was maintained at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was maintained at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ up@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased BM@@ D at the overall hip and Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als at all times .
the Ac@@ up@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo treatment by 5.@@ 4 % compared to placebo treatment and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ aller .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
the study was not designed to reduce clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta has been studied in patients and patients aged more than 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly light to moder@@ ately heavy clay Pa@@ get of the bone ( medium serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ en@@ ic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ch@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was proved in two six @-@ month comparison studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ath during an average follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ en@@ ronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dose @-@ independent .
afterwards , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long formation phase with a terminal exclusion period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clearing amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at the time ) .
a reduced clear@@ ance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances is unlikely to be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mes because it is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) cor@@ related the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron , 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing , and in the 64 examined patients in mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function mal@@ function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the ol@@ ed@@ ron acid required .
because there is only limited data for severe kidney function disorder ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest dose @-@ effective intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and with rats 0,@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
for studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C six times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid was administered in rats using doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose , which corresponds to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , relative to the AU@@ C , corresponding to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to accumulated ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most frequent occurrence in studies of repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the metaph@@ or of long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats , ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity was observed in rats from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C .

July 2007 , completed on 29 September 2006 , the pharmaceutical company vig@@ il@@ ance system described in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the fil@@ ings application is and works before and during the product .
risk Management Plan The holder of the approval for the placing on the market is obliged to carry out studies and additional activities for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance , which are presented in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and of the following versions of the R@@ MP approved by the CH@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities for minim@@ izing the risk could be affected . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . • To request the E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone mar@@ get of bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially o@@ est@@ ro@@ gens that are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the more gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by normal@@ ising bone reconstruction in order to ensure normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ ci@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines / have recently taken / applied medicines , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you use drugs that are known to harm the kidneys .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you should be sure that you have sufficient fluids in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the hip frac@@ ture is operative .
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta has a long time , you may need to take another dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in your blood during the time of in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before you end the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache appear within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms in your account after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs because of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b or num@@ b feeling , especially around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if one of the listed side effects is notic@@ e@@ ably impaired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this user information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; usually 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C .
patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need to be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ en@@ ronic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atically @-@ running , hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium to ensure at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally used to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and also one or more
in addition , there were four studies of more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive means of setting up smoking in comparison to a placebo .
the studies on the setting of the smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable when applying A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ an@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ comp@@ lia &apos;s effectiveness in weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
medicines used in patients who need health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing clari@@ fication packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z
in addition to diet and exercise for treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , they also have one or more risk factors , such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of the treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition to obesity , it also has no apparent risks , and depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other close relatives must point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years has not been shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .
ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort has not been studied , is assumed that the simultaneous dispens@@ ing of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors is the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant
I examined overweight patients as well as in patients with obesity , and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in other indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse events observed under treatment in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who have been treated for weight loss and due to associated metabolic diseases .
if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ desirable effects &lt; 1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very high
only slight symptoms were observed in a case study where a limited number of individuals were given up to 300 mg .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hypertension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
n weight reduction after one year was for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the bas@@ eline , versus 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg , and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.@@ 4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
after 2 years the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
9 weight reduction and other risk factors In the studies in patients without diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with
under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride drop was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 %
in a second study in patients with an obesity and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( ser@@ en@@ ade ) , absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c factor ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference between the average weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . LN
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim Ar@@ z
the steady state plasma levels were achieved after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ trough = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) .
influence of food : he subjects who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in the so@@ bri@@ ety state or after a fat @-@ rich meal , had an increase of 67 % higher C@@ MA@@ x resp@@ . 48 % increased ng AU@@ C .
patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ x and a 43 % lower level of AU@@ C than those of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ her@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analyses ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
5 . prec@@ lin@@ ical data on the safety of the consequences that were not observed in clinical trials , but which occurred in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area , were considered potentially relevant for the clinical application :
in some cases , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be related to process @-@ related stress such as dealing with the animals .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so no adverse effects were observed on the fertility or menstru@@ al disturbances .
the effect of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public evaluation report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic drug ) is not indicated .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , met@@ form@@ in alone cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily set in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ate or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ate or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ate or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and blood sugar levels decline , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ fa drugs , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how good the blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced when using dos@@ ages of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional placebo arm resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin received a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % among the patients who took additional placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( at the sole use ) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the use in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previous advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated output liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels will be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels must be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued until the laboratory parameters are performed by clinical evaluation .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the middle hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ o@@ cr@@ its by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and reduced hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral double or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ phon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ate or as a two @-@ way combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported to reduce visual acuity in diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report on disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning bone frac@@ tures random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of being pregnant , and if a patient wants pregnancy or she is pregnant , the treatment must be removed ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies evaluating the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the pregnancy resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fo@@ etal growth .
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege on the tri@@ ples of the upper limit of the normal range were often similar to placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins .
in an outcome study in patients with existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was .
since the market launch , heart failure was rarely reported under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients were performed in groups treated with comparative media .
in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms oc@@ cured .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an effect on the activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fatty and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ amine production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose improvement in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ genocide as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years in order to study the time up to the treatment effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ genocide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin despite a three @-@ month optimization phase were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents proved statisti@@ cally significant in comparison to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 week investigation of type 2 diabetes .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical studies over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while lower values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and lic@@ la@@ cide .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the post@@ yst@@ al increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which is both an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previous advanced mac@@ ular mac@@ ular disease were random@@ ized into groups that received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , with peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma typically 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the triple of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it could be proven that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radioactive marker pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ exclusion period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and that of the entire active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral secre@@ tion of the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agreed with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible exc@@ entri@@ c cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy after repeated dosing of plasma volume enlargement .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the formation of hyper@@ insulin and increased insulin resistance in the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for red@@ dish growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a led to increased frequency of col@@ on tumours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study more than two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were studied with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in clinical studies more than 1 year a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents proved statisti@@ cally significant in comparison to the initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels but also improved the post@@ yst@@ al increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which is both an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level and the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary ar@@ on@@ ar@@ yn@@ chron@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are not associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and of more than 7,@@ 400 patients who received comparison medication showed an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures were performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was examined in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane did lead to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were similar to that of another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( see the full list of products ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes out@@ weigh the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly , for example by intensified insulin therapy , can change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should therefore be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin , insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against is@@ lan@@ dic origin ) may cause a change in dosing .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different compared to their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may lead to the use of insulin and meals at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia may however develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral feeding of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated by an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the whole working time is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed absorption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were contem@@ plated ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

before each injection , check if at least 12 units of insulin are left in the cartridge , so that an even mixture is ensured .
follow the steps below to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ let with the injection needle to the top • kno@@ ck a few times with your finger slightly against the cartridge .
if bubbles are present , they will collect them up in the cartridge • Whi@@ le you keep Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ let go upwards , rotate the cartridge around one click in direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Whi@@ le you keep the injection needle still up , press the press button entirely ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Now from the tip of the injection needle you must put a drop of insulin .
• Set the cap back so close to the finished pen that the digit 0 is opposite the dosing stamp ( Fig@@ ure E ) • Check if the press button is pressed completely .
if not , turn the cap until the press button is pressed completely • Ke@@ ep your Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ let horizontal .
the scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves out@@ wards , while you rotate the closing cap • The scale below the button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
check the number on the seal right next to the dosing brand • Noti@@ fy the highest number you can see on the press scale • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , simply twist the closing cap forward or backward until you have set the correct number of units .
otherwise , insulin is extracted from the injection needle and the set dose will not be correct • If you mistakenly try to set a dose of more than 78 units , follow these steps :
then remove the cap and place it in such a way that the 0 of the dosing brand is opposite .
make sure to press the pressure button only during injection . • Ke@@ ep the pressure button after injection , until the injection needle has been pulled out of the skin .
if not , turn the cap until the button is pressed completely and continue as described in Before use • Typ@@ ically , when you press the press button , you will hear a clicking sound .
it may not be accurate • You cannot set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining amounts to estimate how much insulin remains .

acet@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin @-@ human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
the doses of acet@@ am@@ ides must also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of acet@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
if two types of insulin are bl@@ ended first , the amount of insulin must first be wound up , followed by the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may lead to the use of insulin and meals at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the place of delivery G@@ ain@@ t - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain , and hem@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) .

a clinical study in an intensive care unit for treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients undergoing major surgical procedures has shown that the mortality rate induced by I.@@ V. ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4,@@ 6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the whole working time amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged 13 to 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

follow the steps below to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ let with the injection needle to the top • kno@@ ck a few times with your finger slightly against the cartridge .
if bubbles are present , they will collect them up in the cartridge • Whi@@ le you continue to keep the needle still up , rotate the cartridge around one click in direction of the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle still shows up , press the push button entirely ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now from the tip of the injection needle you must put a drop of insulin .
• Set the cap back so close to the finished pen that the digit 0 is opposite the dosing stamp ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check if the press button is pressed completely .
the scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves out@@ wards , while you rotate the closing cap • The scale below the press button ( press scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of crystalline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out k@@ not ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger sedi@@ mentary deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first months of treatment , rheum@@ atism can still occur , so it is recommended that the patients continue to use aden@@ ur@@ ic for the treatment of rheum@@ atism at least during the first six months .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who have an organ transplan@@ t , as it has not been studied for these groups .
in the first study , attended by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / d@@ l. in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily intake 120@@ mg , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mal deposits ( including an illness known or currently present ) and / or arthritis .
if the serum hardness levels are still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ L ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration in AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day .
in patients with severe ren@@ al impairment , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients . since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ ts , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ acid @-@ causing medicines , an acute g@@ out attack can occur during the treatment , because the reduction of serum hardness levels causes ur@@ ic acid deposits to be mobil@@ ised in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far increases that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing the phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function before the start of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ oid treatment and in the further course of the clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was did not conduct any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ite mirror ( in@@ hibition of metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
subjects were the simultaneous administration of bas@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg twice daily with an increase in bas@@ eball exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study with test subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x worked a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an ant@@ acid containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de contains the absorption of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease of C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C results .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregnancy can not lead to side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born baby .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ oid group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an ar@@ teri@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events occurring in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical trials , severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions have been observed .
7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies In open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
adverse events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and is produced as part of the hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid reaction process .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for the in vitro @-@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
the efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was demonstrated in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .

the reduction of serum hardness levels to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and kept permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ atin values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .

the data collected in two years of the phase 3 open renewal study showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 required a treatment for a g@@ out delay ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment for a gi@@ g@@ fix ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ utter , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ inal k@@ not until month 24 .
elevated T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) increased and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum concentration levels was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of a low vitamin D level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in drugs approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D level .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data indicating that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , vom@@ iting , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing ) as well as aci@@ dic rise .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied .
it should not be used in diseases of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd . approval for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , characterized with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following tips are to be followed precisely to reduce the risk of hair @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tics , are given only with special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by bad frac@@ tures , were reported in patients receiving al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be pointed out , in case of symptoms of malign@@ ant irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn of the medicine and obtaining medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it following the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an ast@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was found , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a were rarely reported ( after market introduction ) , including some serious and with complications ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy region contains intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available to indicate whether the replacement of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a surgical procedure may reduce the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the treating physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the intended day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before the start of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can imp@@ air the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials in conjunction with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without having clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast @-@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , serum calcium intake was up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosphor@@ us up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar incidence .
following an oral over@@ dose , hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , and side effects can occur in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the medium rise in BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on fem@@ ur h@@ als and 7.@@ 8 % at the tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , compared with the placebo group , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus Pla@@ z@@ ebo 6,@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients experiencing one or more verteb@@ rates .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of the spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur neck and the entire body was maintained .
it consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate cont@@ our by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption Based on intraven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 0.@@ 64 % for women between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before starting a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the mean range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies in rats show that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after intraven@@ ous injection of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed to the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate approximately 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ables .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not accepted that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .
resor@@ ption in healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) was after the administration of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after noc@@ tur@@ nal fast and two hours before taking a meal the average area under the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( without taking into consideration of endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) .
the average maximum concentration of serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an hour until the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
in the liver , biot@@ in formation vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly hydro@@ xi@@ ated to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 and then met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the absence of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy volunteers mean the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the f@@ ences after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate that is not deposited in the bone is quickly removed from the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is still expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , patients with reduced kidney function can expect a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

adv@@ enti@@ f is administered to adult patients , who have been transplan@@ ted to kidney or liver to prevent transplan@@ ted organ transplan@@ ted by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation where the application of Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example by examining how often a new transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter follow @-@ up studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and examined how adv@@ enti@@ f is taken up by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , adv@@ enti@@ f may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful if other ( in particular some herbal ) medicines are taken simultaneously with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the advance dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be appropriately adjusted accordingly .

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of adv@@ enti@@ a should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ reflection provisions ( see below ) Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low levels should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after switching .
in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as tal@@ low level , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate night ran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clearing substance , an adaptation of the adv@@ ant dose can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the condition of the patient in the first postoperative period does not allow oral dosing of medicines , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion fluid ) can be initiated with a dose of ca .
duration of application For suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ enti@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dose adjustments can be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral adv@@ enti@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
recommended dosage : conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Advent must be converted from twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of adv@@ enti@@ f , so this conversion will take place in a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the total daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ enti@@ f once a day , treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must commen@@ ce for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day once a day for adult patients who are converted to adv@@ enti@@ s .
although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ enti@@ s in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ted patients , patients in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and on color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts are used in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood flow levels in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of the dose .
patients with impaired ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine condition and monitoring of urine volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to adv@@ enti@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , be careful ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of blood in the whole blood The dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ c controls .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ tal@@ low levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or concur@@ rent application of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the steady state has entered .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus &apos;s tal@@ low levels in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that can occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; form@@ ulations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be therapy @-@ resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ t recipients .
due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies during treatment with adv@@ enti@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a aqu@@ eous or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which is therefore also possible under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are symptoms of PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as adv@@ enti@@ f hard capsules , ret@@ arded , lac@@ tose present , special caution is required in patients with rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and , consequently , increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore advisable to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while adding substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain constant concentrations ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction was associated with anti@@ fung@@ al such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio @-@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly d@@ osed Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or Meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the concur@@ rent application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which interfere with metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the level of hormone ex@@ foli@@ ation , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive action must be taken particularly cau@@ ti@@ ously .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could potentially l@@ essen the clear@@ ances of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
results from a small number of studies in transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially in terms of its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ cal@@ c@@ emia of new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not exactly determined because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and concur@@ rent treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , side effects are reported in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As known for other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are often increased suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ als ) .
cases of virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including therapy with adv@@ enti@@ f .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ma including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was reported .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ zable .
the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and also the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 trial transplan@@ ted patients , with 4@@ 75 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the large trials in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f , over 110 patients were reported to receive either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in in 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ate syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 21.@@ 7 % of cases the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients being converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis &apos;s ob@@ liter@@ ation syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multi @-@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ as and kidney transplan@@ t , receiving a random@@ ised procedure Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations , leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly through bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the total daily dose .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .

adv@@ ant is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( due to the deficiency of factor VI@@ II conditioned , con@@ genital hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ances are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in the case of surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A are suffering from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced using a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables it to form the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to a medicine approved in the European Union , called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the drug application was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood points with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the transport of lawyers across the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
inj@@ ected every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impairment are removed .
inj@@ ected every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the danger for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , appropriate determination of Factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis On long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. are to be given by factor VI@@ II per kg body weight in a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II directed Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in previously treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ angular ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which show a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ level was observed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE .
in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) reported a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients from an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) were treated with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred which indicated an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients , the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ le gran@@ u@@ loc@@ y@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE has reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of allergic type including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for the activation factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE &apos;s security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , has decided that the authorisation holder is to apply another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited handed over to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company accepts its application for approval for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breasts , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus which has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been changed so that it does not produce copies of itself and thus does not trigger infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and the killing of the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the documents submitted at the beginning , the CH@@ MP generates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors provides benefits for patients .
the Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not sufficiently proved that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notify the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ peti@@ tive Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ apped .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reli@@ ed on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ ase ) , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for treating allergies ) .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients suffering from con@@ ges@@ tion glaucoma ( elevated intraocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary tract ( ag@@ grav@@ ated ur@@ ination ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ spinal fluid ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral stroke ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the marketing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue after sound of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after a decrease in the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors resp@@ . within the 2 weeks following completion of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , lis@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ ar@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ can@@ on@@ c@@ tiva , which can be used per@@ oral or nas@@ al as a wa@@ ving Rhin@@ opla@@ sty ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy was not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headache or ampli@@ fication of headache ) must be removed .
patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be removed at least 48 hours before the performance of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent .
in clinical ex@@ ams with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor testing showed no significant differences between patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is not inhibit@@ ing in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ory and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness which can lead to impairment of traffic injury or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mi@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of fluid performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine @-@ antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total scores for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ ous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can be det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the plasma administration .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out as tablet on healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n changed badly .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine following the exclusive administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is equivalent to exposure to an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the fil@@ ings application described pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , to un@@ fold its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose , and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash have been reported rarely .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ases , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspic@@ uous liver strains has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ at for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for capturing .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies involving approximately 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by determining the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % among the patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decline of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us was 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us must@@ n &apos;t be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe to appro@@ ve the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
a tablet once a day , with or without a meal , for allevi@@ ating symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be termin@@ ated after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed in their recovery .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol has not increased the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness can result , which can lead to impairment of traffic injury or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical studies in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in the recommended dose of 5 mg , compared to patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported in placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was headache . this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ s as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg per day in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg demonstrated no influence on standard measurement parameters of fluid performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be classified as an alternative to the duration of the symptoms as well as in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology despite the eti@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited simply pro@@ spec@@ tively .
as hist@@ am@@ infection is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ell@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in addition to the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n also leads to improvement in symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka was excluded from the study .
improvement of the itch around more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and vig@@ il@@ ance , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation , once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ory and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher levels of substance ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 is identical to that of children who are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol has not increased the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % side effects reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ mon@@ dosis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the progression of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
for a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents showed no impairment of psych@@ om@@ otor activity in adults and adolescents .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not result in increased drow@@ sin@@ ess due to the increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance impairment .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ sian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed without restriction .
the load ( AU@@ C ) caused by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant drug con@@ ges@@ tion after once daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 different single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to those recommended in pedi@@ atric patients with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III brown bottles with child @-@ safe Poly@@ propylene stra@@ pping cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ le must be removed without damaging them .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi@@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess was found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day compared to placebo .
at a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets once daily put into the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be taken without damaging them .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of processed tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years has not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects of the dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was the same and did not significantly devi@@ ate from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ ate for the inclusion of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically significant clinical study of multiple doses , which was used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , was not statisti@@ cally significant or clinical .
at a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of this badly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophi@@ is@@ ate for inclusion , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between the ages of 2 and 11 , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the group of patients in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group .
in infants aged 6 to 23 months , the most common adverse events reported were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
the recommended doses were the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be used in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of the symptoms .
as demonstrated by the total scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for intake is available in bottles with child @-@ safe closing lid with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml pack size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe for preparation to take with sc@@ aling of 2.5 m@@ l@@ - and 5 ml cans .
June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics left the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to announce that the company accepts its application for A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s marketing application in order to prevent avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because humans have not yet built up immunity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus that are contained in the vaccine as a &quot; foreign body &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this trunk .
subsequently , the membrane of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface identified as foreign to the human body ) was puri@@ fied , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of Type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution to intake , but it cannot be taken together with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
am@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day , which are taken together with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day and with other anti@@ viral drugs .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ a is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , am@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases related to AIDS .
am@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the medication used with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load change after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously not taken any prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo , but am@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r .
in children , ast@@ er@@ ase also reduced viral load , but only a few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase increased viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
patients with HIV , which were resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , met with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 gener@@ ases may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
it may also not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement to treat depression ) or medicines that are broken down just like as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take ast@@ er@@ ase are the risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of am@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors out@@ weigh the risks over four years .
am@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic rein@@ for@@ cer Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the use of am@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was required at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited Company a permit for the placing of as@@ er@@ ase in the entire European Union .
am@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually A@@ gener@@ a should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsule ; therefore , am@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for capturing on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dosage for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of am@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of am@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
am@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ a capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
am@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
plant preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and reduced therapeutic effects of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during intake of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tioned that am@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with am@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of the simultaneous anti @-@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with existing reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of am@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of ast@@ er@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ard@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , am@@ gener@@ ases may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium deficiency , especially if at the same time low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity caused by the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ a solution for inclusion , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
am@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases to which therapies were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , like a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune deficiency , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections can lead to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly confused with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose @-@ increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse reactions to the liver were frequently observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s Wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % In@@ cre@@ ased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % degra@@ ded when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ oric acid ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed surveillance as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of as@@ gener@@ a in combination with di@@ an@@ os@@ ine , but is recommended due to the an@@ a@@ genetic component of di@@ an@@ os@@ ine that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din could be less effective because of reduced or potentially sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
when these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the concur@@ rent application of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however the plasma levels of both medicines could be elevated in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily resulted in an increase of the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneously using F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if used together with as@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ a .
based on the data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as am@@ gener@@ ase as it can result in resor@@ ption of resor@@ ption .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers , such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ thi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ thi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ thi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ thi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ thi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ thi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ thi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ thi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ thi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ thi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@
concur@@ rent am@@ gener@@ ase intake can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , concur@@ rent am@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are pronounced increases in plasma levels combined with concur@@ rent am@@ gener@@ ase .
since plas@@ mas@@ king increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
a more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ ising the mirror is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by adding am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , it should not be used together with or@@ ally captured Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while the simultaneous use of am@@ gener@@ ase is required with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution .
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3 to 4 times .
when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium deficiency , especially if lower doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the very low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is currently available , as am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended by simul@@ ating ast@@ er@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r survi@@ ves in people &apos;s milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 weight of the offspring during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of the descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of am@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most associated side effects associated with A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , rising early and rarely leading to the dis@@ continuation of the treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking am@@ gener@@ acy or other drugs used to treat HIV , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ F@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which not pre @-@ treated patients received 1200 mg of as@@ gener@@ ase twice a day with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were classified as related to study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) were performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and peripheral fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervical fat accumulation ( breast@@ feeding ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ ally untreated persons who had been treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s compared to 27 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or macro @-@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and generally disappeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) .
in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune deficiency , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ al opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initi@@ ating anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI previously treated patients who received 600 mg of am@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed among all am@@ gener@@ a treatment , were very common in patients who received am@@ gener@@ ase along with low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe an indication of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhibit@@ ing HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r t@@ oo@@ st@@ erten treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .

gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) to patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretations systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r generally remains intact .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre@@ treated patients with a F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment and another against Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 Isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early break@@ age of a failing therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the efficacy of am@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which PI pre@@ treated adults with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
sixty @-@ one sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison with the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ cap@@ tive threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached am@@ gener@@ a is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of whom 152 had been pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a was tested three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day .
no low dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; most of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with am@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on these data , therapy optimisation should be considered with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ desired &quot; am@@ gener@@ a .
after oral dosing , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ MA@@ x by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal results in a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , minimal concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous eating intake was influenced by the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in plasma , with the amount of incomplete am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of incomplete am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component in the dosing intervals varies depending on the total @-@ drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 need to be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with am@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose of A@@ gener@@ a capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is available from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , am@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not re@@ plac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram base .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ances of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effects of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regi@@ mens lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes were neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
up to now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of am@@ gener@@ ase after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rabbit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , which indicate a delayed development , were observed .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of am@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with poor or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ard@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
am@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % In@@ cre@@ ased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ oric acid ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed surveillance as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
when these drugs are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ ep@@ di@@ pine , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
in the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ a , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother in comparison with possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of am@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe an indication of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ory concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , it should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI in the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ desired &quot; am@@ gener@@ a .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the overall drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 need to be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with am@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clear@@ ances of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas comp@@ lied with doses that correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vitro and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ core test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate in both the control and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the Met@@ abol@@ ization channels are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ a solution for inclusion is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a solution for taking into account was not covered either with PI pre@@ treated patients or with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsule ; therefore , am@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for capturing on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body@@ weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a day maximum of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dose recommendation for the concur@@ rent application of A@@ gener@@ a solution can be given to intake and low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ a solution for taking patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l , A@@ EG &apos;s solution is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be cau@@ tioned that am@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with am@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
am@@ gener@@ ase should be stopped for a long time when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % In@@ cre@@ ased , for C@@ MA@@ x reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
concur@@ rent am@@ gener@@ ase intake can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significant higher plasma concentrations of mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us it may not be applied to the contained propylene gly@@ co@@ l during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tose @-@ related rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r survi@@ ves in people &apos;s milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase of 55 body@@ weight during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of am@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking am@@ gener@@ acy or other drugs used to treat HIV , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - as in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r t@@ oo@@ st@@ erten treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
62 Based on these data , therapy optimisation should be considered with PI pre@@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ desired &quot; am@@ gener@@ a .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large c@@ f. volume as well as a un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rabbit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes , which indicate a delayed development , were observed .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • Al@@ dar@@ a is up to a maximum of 16 weeks to be performed three times a week . • In case of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses it is performed three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to apply to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which the patients were treated for six weeks , and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo either performed daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete detachment of the tumours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies to a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is continued until all visible war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anus area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period only completely healed the treated les@@ ions , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient must apply the cream once he / she notices this and continue with the usual therapeutic plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the cleaned areas infected with the skin until the cream is fully covered .

in other studies , in which no daily Vor@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was conducted , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a s@@ ut@@ ure leading to circumc@@ ision .
an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 ) has been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the outlet of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
in order to apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applic@@ ated funds for the treatment of external bias in the genital and peri@@ anus area , no clinical experiences are available until now .
although limited data indicate increased rate of slope reductions in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown less efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of the incl@@ ine war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line were not investigated .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions are after completion of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the treatment may be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with rel@@ ap@@ sed and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the application for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less chance of response to the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lab@@ yrinth .
very limited data about the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis in anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the lower arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normal@@ ise in the course of the therapy with intensity or go back after the onset of therapy with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions to the patient are causing great discomfort or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 active les@@ ions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were achieved , no recommendation could be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine creme in related side effects in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the location of the treatment of the ti@@ lt war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the most frequently reported and prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in connection with side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the 185 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated bas@@ ali@@ oma patients from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects are shown below .
the most common adverse event , possibly or possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream , were in these studies a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials showed that these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream often lead to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cl@@ ori@@ ation / leaves / shed ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of the clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream often resulted in severe ery@@ them@@ ums ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe de@@ formation and cal@@ ci@@ dity ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was noted with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental one @-@ off oral recording of 200 mg is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , corresponding to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most severe side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the ti@@ lt war@@ ts in i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
in 60 % of all patients who were treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , the ti@@ lt war@@ ts healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine &apos;s efficacy in five times a week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients had clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 of treatment area on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face .
the results from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications external bias , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses taken there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively .
a minimal systemic assimil@@ ation of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application for 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ ru@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG showed a significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study for der@@ mal application conducted four months showed no similar effects in mice .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours on the application .
the mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , it is a risk for humans to look very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme substitute therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , ag@@ grav@@ ating movements , decreased lung capacity , heart and eye diseases .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or a hospital with re@@ vit@@ alizing equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicine before the administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion area .
very frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information , which may be known , and update this summary , where necessary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in terms of reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ l @-@ ion @-@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in single steps .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule could be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any adverse event occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
as a result of the Phase 3 clinical trial , almost all Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected to form , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously performed after an interruption of the treatment .
pre@@ treat 60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ agents ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of light or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular image of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data in new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version was performed within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment , whereby the patients at the age of 5 were usually diagnosed with a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within one month ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 trial ( or up to early ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients showed no antibodies being detected by radio@@ immuno@@ op@@ lec@@ turing ( R@@ IP ) , including 3 patients in which there was never a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with a lack of up to a low antibody level showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme substitute therapy lies in the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulating medium and preventing further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of the patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the serious phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received a further 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and sal@@ vi@@ ability shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes further increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) achieved a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel was observed in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , which summari@@ zed clin@@ ically significant changes across the range of five efficacy variables ( anticipated percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walking test , range of movement of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in 20 patients , who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a growth rate ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were found after the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of exp@@ ir@@ ation ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form had a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation were limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ met@@ ry dosing schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule of 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with unique ability , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data can not identify any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another cancer against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs for cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies than any therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent de@@ hydr@@ ation ) should be given before or after the administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood picture changes or when certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , stopped or the dose can be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another cancer against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ axel .
however , both studies showed patients who did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival compared to the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for the placing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the appropriate volume of the necessary dose is removed and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed application as well as the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after each third movement cycle .
in patients receiving mixed blood , a complete blood picture should be created before each Gift - including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a plat@@ el@@ et of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose examination must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximal non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the predic@@ tive therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria reflect the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
if patients with non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity develop ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be stopped with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped if a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose duc@@ ts or - on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or higher compared to 65 years of age there is an increased risk risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ atine @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ atine @-@ clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or tran@@ sam@@ ination values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit ( for liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils regain a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on Na@@ dir of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ is , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce stress @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous use of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients with a p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients with these events had appropriate risk factors for the incidence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with a clin@@ ically significant liquid retention in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the ergometer is to be considered before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed when this compound was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the concur@@ rent application of atten@@ u@@ ated vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible pe@@ eling of the reproductive capacity by means of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment plan to obtain advice on how to protect the sperm .
high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) lead to reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advised if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
( i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ value such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as for an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be applied during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly damaging the reproductive capacity by means of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm cells .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is passed into the breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

* Per@@ taining to National Cancer Institute C@@ TC version 2 for each toxic@@ ity degree . * * Based on National Cancer Institute C@@ TC ( v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) , hair loss should be reported only as degrees 1 or 2 .
for this table , a threshold of 5 % was defined as regards the recording of all events where the reporting physician held a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC Tox@@ ic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were random@@ ized to em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed random@@ ized ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant lab toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 of the combined mono@@ therapies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) of phase 2 , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in patient population , as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events that could be related to the study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC who random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC , which random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accidents and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks have been occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
clinical trials have occasionally reported cases of co@@ litis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ations , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) .
clinical trials have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
it has been reported in cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radi@@ otherapy were reported in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated before , during or after their sequ@@ ential treatment ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate which performs its effect by interrup@@ ting important , fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple points of attack by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ re@@ reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis by thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ del@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ized , easy @-@ blind Phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage over a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month extended survival compared to those patients who were only am@@ using with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the exclusive C@@ is@@ pla@@ in@@ tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a worsen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was a medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months with patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival was observed in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1,@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination in relation to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
medi@@ ated PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ difference limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring extends from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the pro@@ - duct .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square metre in combination with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and who do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in the food , causing roughly a quarter of the fats that have been fed to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received 60 mg of all@@ i had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no adverse weight loss could be observed .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ ds , bow@@ els , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , indul@@ gence of o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or suffer from ch@@ ol@@ est@@ asis ( liver disease ) , and pregnant women or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only resor@@ bed to minimal , elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage is necessary .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
as the weight reduction in diabetes is accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adapted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional precau@@ tionary measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the event of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
a reduction in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed in both a study on drug interactions and in several cases with the simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
in the use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin content ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose of am@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not pri@@ cel@@ ess ) .
the frequency of known side effects noted after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
the majority of reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the launch were reported to have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on tests on humans and animals , a quick recovery of any systemic effects caused by the lip@@ ase inhibit@@ ory properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sett@@ les in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in remainder of the ga@@ str@@ e and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ s .
it was derived from clinical studies that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 confirm the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both trials , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months .
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist measurement the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ c and extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ on@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ Leu@@ cine group ) , were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients , representing nearly 42 % of total plasma concentration .

oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of oral ever @-@ increasing means of contrac@@ eption ( pill ) may be weakened or lifted if you have severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) .
please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist before taking all@@ i if you : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one for the treatment of heart rhythm disorders . • Apply ast@@ o@@ carb@@ ose to treat diabetes .
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and if you take drugs against high blood pressure , as the dosage may need to be adjusted .
find out more on the blue pages in Section 6 for how to set your cal@@ ori@@ ental and fet@@ al boundaries .
if you leave a meal or have a meal no fat , do not intake any capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule together with a meal containing too much fat , you risk food @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see Section 4 ) .
to get used to the new eating habits , you are already beginning to take cap@@ s@@ ulation using a calorie and fat reduction diet .
food di@@ aries are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits .
to safely achieve your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
eat fatty acids to reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see Section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before starting with taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity . • Abi@@ de physically active during intake and after completion of ing@@ es@@ tion of all@@ i .

the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment starts , as at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize dietary supplements : • Begin for a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the serv@@ ings you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit is likely to exceed your fat limit . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat that you may consume per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial dessert , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with these accompanying symptoms learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children . • Do not use more than 25 ° C according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the cart@@ on . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .

a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health .
select meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication on the packaging of food . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should intake a maximum per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
which amount is suitable for you , refer to the information below that indicates the number of calories appropriate for you . • By using the capsule &apos;s mode of operation , compliance with the recommended fat intake is critical .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .

Alo@@ xi is used for chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group .
this means that the substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies Alo@@ xi was studied in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with al@@ op@@ ia showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who were treated with al@@ op@@ ia showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of al@@ op@@ les for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the intestinal prompt , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ st@@ ination or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists caution is advised with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical trial , there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral metast@@ asis , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , c@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences regarding the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were reported at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly related to Alo@@ xi , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ st@@ ination ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dose , similar frequencies of adverse events were seen as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , but due to large distribution volumes a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy with an al@@ op@@ ia over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were given , given intraven@@ ously to day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients given intraven@@ ously to day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with medi@@ cally em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was to assess the EC@@ G @-@ effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron i.@@ v. administered in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption following intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations , a slow elimination from the body with an average half @-@ life time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ related in total dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached a total of 0.@@ 75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , are involved in the iso@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min after a single intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in healthy subjects .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , terminal exclusion of the liver and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indications are that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose met about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily for two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dosage and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans .
the holder of this authorisation for placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the medicine approved in the context of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicinal product called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is already approved in the EU ( called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damage , besides , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ o @-@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are raised in the blood .
yeast produces a gene ( DNA ) , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data demonstrating the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the treatment after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after setting the treatment ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns the CH@@ MP have led to the recommendation to deny approval for the marketing ?
furthermore , concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suff@@ ice .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon the disease again increased to more patients than with the reference drug . in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate whether the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it may be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cru@@ sts ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ ings ( crack or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age the area to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 patients ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients were treated with placebo .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together by skin wounds , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it has been found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which has been observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small la@@ inc@@ ts , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and alternative therapy may be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be , the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ination should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary @-@ infected open wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo cannot be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ imm@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 Acc@@ ording to the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ination AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ination o@@ int@@ ment to reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , doses adjustments are not required when topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the effects on birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / termin@@ ates or the treatment should be continued with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is possible to weigh between the benefit of breast @-@ feeding and the benefit of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most reported side @-@ effect irritation was at the administration point , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ally inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved with the ri@@ bos@@ ome protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding on this binding site , p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the transfer of pe@@ p@@ tide , partially blocks P @-@ binding interactions and prevents normal development of active 50s @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the use of retin@@ ame in at least some infections seems question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Den@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
absorption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ination o@@ int@@ ment was performed daily under occ@@ lu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ination o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ination IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP escap@@ ement .
metabolism The in vitro fer@@ oxid@@ ative metabol@@ isms of retin@@ ame in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was medi@@ ated primarily through C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with small involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .

neither male nor female rats showed signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ) :

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and that the vacc@@ ination plan can be carried out at the end of two doses .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the ino@@ cul@@ ated vaccine Twin@@ rix adults , which has been approved since 1996 , and has been the registered vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix &apos;s adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional 20@@ 8 children study , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
at between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection for the development of protective anti @-@ antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six and a 12 month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be applied to patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals / s.@@ a. a permit for the marketing of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ori@@ tis@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses , with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are the same as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination may need a catch @-@ up as protection , as they may also be protected by immune memory even in cases of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels following the pri@@ mers , so that in these cases the administration of additional doses can be required .
because intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , Ambi@@ rix can , however , be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ally , as in these cases , bleeding can occur after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , administered simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ects , it is assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved .
in a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ efulness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever compared to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ opathy and preserv@@ ative formulation was observed .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ination t@@ ins Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s compatibility with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine was compared .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and toxic@@ ity on a basis for a calculation basis , but not on the basis of a calculation basis for each person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given up Ambi@@ rix reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ efulness was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the total vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ ence compared to 3@@ 6.2 % among the subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and toxic@@ ity was low and comparable to that observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the ages of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 year olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evaluated , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the 3 @-@ dose @-@ vaccine was significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 @-@ 11 year olds one month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ mers , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that observed after ino@@ cul@@ ation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies has been shown 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vaccine scheme .
if the first dose Ambi@@ rix was given at the same time as a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ el , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for the current formulation as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted via virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in the waters contaminated by bathing waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series with 2 doses has been completed .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ ination t@@ ins , ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or feel sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be con@@ ferred .
• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has / has .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vaccine dosage ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per acc@@ ent ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccine for this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will be spra@@ yed under the skin and not in the muscle if you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child undergo hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child is taking another medicine ( including those you have received without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated / has received / has received / has received / has received / has planned this in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not admini@@ ster pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgent that they be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) in your child .
if you miss the scheduled appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .

based on data known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix has been put into traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in the pre@@ history of patients at the age of over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia ende@@ mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentration ) .
ammon@@ ia is - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y dish ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nose probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
this was not a comparative study , because am@@ mon@@ aps couldn &apos;t be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , that is , without the active substance ) .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of appetite , a abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste problems or taste sa@@ vor , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disturbances in the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information was prescribed for this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
for patients suffering from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ lei@@ scar@@ can@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ ini @-@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of the gen@@ esis of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats at high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve cells in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one un@@ desired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity during intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabol@@ ically active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be compared with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with a distur@@ b@@ ance of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the early @-@ manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious , and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ ga within the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative paths of nitrogen secre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , protein reduced and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ um ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was with time with many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ can@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further worsen@@ ing of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism , and cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis by up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was det@@ ectable in the morning after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium but@@ y@@ rate had no significant effects in rats with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who can &apos;t swallow tablets , or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ y or nose probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
for patients suffering from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ lei@@ scar@@ can@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) , les@@ ions occurred in the cran@@ ial nerve cells .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tate , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be compared with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of investigations on the elimination of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disturbances in the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that the sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further worsen@@ ing of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
during durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of less than 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins .
if your laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may go into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headache , taste problems , om@@ is@@ sion of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory defic@@ its and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , get in touch with your doctor or the emergency department of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS over the same single box or over a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( tu@@ bing that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose probe ( tube that is guided through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate out of the container . • Place a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the edge of the knife , to remove surplus gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress up@@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is given and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI the patient was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year as well as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in with regard to all indicators , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that it was an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the placing of angi@@ o@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST attack inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention is provided .
the recommended starting dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous release of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a further PCI is performed with the patient , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
an injection of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered immediately prior to the procedure followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous release of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body@@ weight and an immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed prior to use and administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) that are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is given and the ACT @-@ 5 minutes after the second beta dose must be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ vali@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment with an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after finishing the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • serious kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with respect to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of cases of arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in the case of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ vali@@ din , patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can perform bleeding in principle everywhere .
in patients taking war@@ far@@ in and being treated with a bi@@ vali@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ard@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ din is reg@@ ained once again prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the effective mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) , these substances can increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ din with plat@@ el@@ et aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked .
in relation to the effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the detachment or the post@@ nat@@ al development are insufficient ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ enal ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as patients over 65 years of age were more suscep@@ tible to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
serious ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding such as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ den@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY serious hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of pun@@ cture , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ din in 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ enal ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years of age were more pre@@ valent than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system classes .
in the event of over@@ dosing , the treatment with a bi@@ vali@@ din is immediately dis@@ connected and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and in the anim@@ ate region of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is present in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
binding of bi@@ vali@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is slowly spl@@ itting the binding of bi@@ vali@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active center of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ din was not induced to indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ vali@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out subsequently , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST attack inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ vali@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a per@@ cut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
it is expected that bi@@ vali@@ din as pe@@ p@@ tide is going through cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ distribution of amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabol@@ ite resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence by Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from 6 years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the upper arm , or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from human acting , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter working life than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in a study of 8@@ 78 adults , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , indicating how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study in adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ p was observed after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration decreased 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human nor@@ acting insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adapted if it is given together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal wall .
because of reduced glu@@ cos@@ ity capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with reduced liver function .
any change of the active ingredient , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc lag , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may change the insulin needs .
3 An insufficient dosage or termination of treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dose .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , Dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Mono@@ amin oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , sal@@ ox@@ ic@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ regulation can be allevi@@ ated or lacking under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in enters into human breast milk , but generally insulin does not enter into breast milk nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application .

severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ eing the patient in a hospital , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the impact occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ ic normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ yo@@ - tus , insulin sensitivity in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more , a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it became apparent that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a similar post@@ gres@@ sional gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was taken 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ gres@@ sive control was achieved than with a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with normal insulin analog , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in administered 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin , 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in administered 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
