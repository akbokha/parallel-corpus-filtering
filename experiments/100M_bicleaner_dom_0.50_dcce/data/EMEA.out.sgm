<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public evaluation report (EPAR) explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirling thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychological condition in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal mood) alternating with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have approached the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used to take one or the enamel tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">The dose of Abilify should be adapted to patients who use other medicines at the same time as Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication of nerve cells among each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed mainly as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was examined in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">Efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that led to increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, over twelve weeks, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo, to prevent recurrence, compared to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder leading to increased unrest using Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the enamel tablets and the solution for intake (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15mg, showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms than patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">Moreover, up to 74 weeks Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled tick), tremors (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (nausea), vomiting, nausea, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to serious manic episodes in bipolar-I disorders and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients with predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes coincided with the treatment with Aripiprazole were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder when oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. for the marketing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in case of treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transmission disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undesirable cerebrovascular events associated with Aripiprazole treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polythipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle, and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint offering of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose level before starting the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethacrylate / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (OV prazole) and 3A4 (Dextromethacrylan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This medicine may not be used in pregnancy because of insufficient data for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned to use dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole received a reduced incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazole and 13.1% in patients was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients under Olangerine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazole and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term endurance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events related to an anti-psychotic therapy and also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without any death sequences.</seg>
<seg id="73">Admittedly, there is no information on the effectiveness of hemodialysis in the treatment of overdosing with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdosing, as Aripiprazole has a high plasmapry binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance over the combination of a partially antagonistic effect on dopamine D 2 and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTP receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for the dopamine D2 and D3 receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>

<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a half-operidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients, who maintained a response to the study medication, were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and half-operated dol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than half-surgery.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate of 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">Under Aripiprazole (N = 18 or 13% of the evaluable patient data sets), a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a proven efficacy against placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I-disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazole showed a placebo-superior efficacy in week 3 and a substantial effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I-disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms that partially did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation stage before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylosion of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkylamation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A popup-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not reveal any clinically significant differences with regard to ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in patients with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in doses or exposures that have clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans, thus they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-sensitive adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-corde carcinomas and combined adrenal cortomas / carcinomas at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was detected as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations found in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the mean and 11 times of the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical condition taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">In case a further oral treatment with Aripiprazole is indicated, see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify processed tablets or Abilify solution for inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with aggibility and behavioural problems caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I-disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazole injection solution, patients should be observed with extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, transmission disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polythipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedging was greater compared to the one-off of Aripiprazole, in a study conducted in healthy subjects Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) as one-off input intramuscularly and which received at the same time lauazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The h2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites, compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- proteaseinhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After setting the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose level before starting the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly received, the intensity of the sedging was greater compared to that after allotted by Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials involving Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral Aripiprazole as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term endurance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazole and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events related to an anti-psychotic therapy and also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances was the Aripiprazole injection solution combined with statistically significant improvements of astertitude / behavioural problems compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder and behavioural disorder, the Aripiprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms in relation to placebo and similar to the Lorazepine reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement of the baseline at the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of sub-groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe apprehension, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a half-operidol-controlled study, 52 percent of responder patients, who included a response to the study medication, were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary educational objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than half-surgery.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher reduction of the relapse rate, which was found at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, increased weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I-disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms that partially did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study enlargement in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilisation stage before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazol AUC is 90% greater than the AUC after the dose of the same dose as tablet; the systemic exposure was similar to the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time for achieving maximum plasma levels was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazole injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration in systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- and 5 times over the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application, no safety-related concerns after maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) were above the maximum humantherapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects have only been observed in doses or exposures that have clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans; therefore, they have limited or no importance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">Effects included a dose-dependent side kidney toxicity (lipofuscin pigmentation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase of adrenal-corde carcinomas and combined adrenal-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was found as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1- to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-fold of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, some of which had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in exclusive administration or monotherapy) was compared with a medication containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only the patients who were treated for the first time in metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsening disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who had previously received other treatments for metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in their blood prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective in patients with which the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel and that unlike other paclitaxel medicines, it was not necessary to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the placing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who fail first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not shown for standard anthracycline treatment (see also Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In neuropathy grade 3 the treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degree 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of doses adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel, which could have essentially other pharmacological features than other types of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should immediately be removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients, no retracting of the Abraxane treatment courses should be initiated, until the number of neutrophils is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">Whereas a clearly indicated cardiotoxicity was not detected, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In case patients have nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea after the treatment of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetics and constipating agents.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or for women in childbearing age who do not have effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is essential.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraception method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised against the treatment of a sperm conserving as the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very often) and giddiness (often), which can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and significant incidents of side effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal phase III clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most eye-catching important haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 lists the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate in blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burn, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stools, oessophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the thorax wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness Very frequent:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in context in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency were possible and no causal connection with these events was established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimigotubules active substance that promotes the contraction of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by blocking their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 Albinal receptor and due to the albuminous protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation appears in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unrelated trials and 454 patients treated in a randomized phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy alone, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% because of metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to the progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients experiencing a peripheral neuropathy level 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to decay on baseline based on the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to the intravenous administration of Abraxane on patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multi-phase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates an extensive extravascular distribution and / or soft binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel after intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane were compared with the values after a 3 hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after a solvent-based paclitaxel injection and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">The published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers is reported to be metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value of the total dose was 4% of the total dose associated with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel.</seg>

<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood pressure values, in which complications may arise in connection with a blood transfusion if a blood donor is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml may be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abyamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make a blood donation, abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter for adults, respectively between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be monitored before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by a erythropoietal deficiency, or that the body does not adequately address the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">After administration, Abyamed was compared to a Vene in a major study involving 479 patients suffering from renal problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to Abyamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the start of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of abseamed under the skin were studied with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients who suffered from an anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to abseamed were maintained to the same degree as those receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dL of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abyamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, pungent migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Flyamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that, in accordance with the regulations of the European Union, it provided evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces Abyamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted to the company Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co KG a permit for the placing of abseamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma who received chemotherapy and the risk of transfusion due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia following chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate aemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], no iron deficiency) if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, with planned larger surgical interventions (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">In order to reduce foreign blood, abseamed can be used in adults with an adult without an iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may not be applied to an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anaemia and as a result may vary depending on age, sex, and overall disease burden; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In light of this haemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dosage is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required to control anaemia and anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb-value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb-value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anaemia and subsequent complications may vary depending on age, sex, and overall disease burden; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required.</seg>
<seg id="396">In light of this haemoglobin variability, an appropriate dose management should be tried to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose, which is required to control anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the hemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulocytes is increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the number of reticulozytes &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after four weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulocytes is increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulocytes by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood canned blood vessels is required, were received in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the Abystreamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg of epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the cycle.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who are diagnosed with any erythropoietin at a erythroblastomia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive a streamed or other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoma).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment, unstable angina (angina pectoris), increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (e.g. anamnestic known venous thromboembolilies).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are not eligible for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and who do not participate in an autologous blood donor program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, adjuvant or underlying diseases; patients with recently established heart attack or cerebrovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomy (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti-body-mediated PRCA after months of months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effectiveness, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl. a month) with increased demand for transfusions, the actual causes should be determined and the common causes of non-response (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminizing toxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the synthetic ulocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the reticulocyte index), is lower (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of an effective loss is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow can be considered to diagnose a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abyamed in patients with a risk of an anti-body-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoid-stimulating agents (ESA) were given a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit associated with the administration of epoetines if the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control anaemia and prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in hemoglobin should be about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients receiving chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoietin response should be considered (patients who have to be transliterated).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adapted to section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapic anemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk weighing under the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients with a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, before the onset of epoetin alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia should be investigated and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thromboseprophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in case of a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epoetin alfa an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vasculature could exist for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine has not been proven that in patients with symptomatic anaemia they can improve overall survival or reduce the risk of progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, a haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adapted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies of tumor tissues no indication of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular occurrences such as myocardial ischaemias, myocardial infarcts, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thromboses, arterial thrombosis, dorsal thromboses, dorsal thromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under erythropoetin-treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascularity (see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under treatment with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, patients with cardiovascular disease may come to thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">The biotechnologically extracted epoetin alfa is glycosiated and is identical with the endogenous human erythropoietin, which was isolated from the urine of anaemia patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be demonstrated with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoesis and does not affect leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="575">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two trials to a total of 357 patients and compared with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkaline phosphatase content in serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the baseline.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of fractures in patients with aclasta (without any osteoporosis medication) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without any other osteoporosis medication), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most Aclasta side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to phenolic acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion area and osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta manufactures information for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information on how to use the medicine, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Paget's disease, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget with Aclasta, a long remission was observed in patients who responded to therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient intake of calcium to ensure at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium twice a day, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of acetamol.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-clearing &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this group of patients.</seg>

<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min), since only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalzemia is to be treated with aclasta due to sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting therapy (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Zolenronic acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary and sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia may develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient intake of calcium to ensure at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium twice a day, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Before using bisphosphonates, cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids (bad oral hygiene) should be examined with appropriate preventive dental treatment prior to the use of bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental treatment, no data is available whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoarthritis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">Clinical evaluation by the treating physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of cases reported as serious side effects of atrial fibrillation in patients receiving Aclasta increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder Zolenronic acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which expressed itself as a decrease in kidney function (i.e. an increase of serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">Changes in the creatinin-clearing (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of renal failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years between the aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatine within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values that were below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the patient's disease-Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid postmenopausal osteoporosis, in the study on the avoidance of fractures after hip fractures and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical trial, local reactions to the infusion location, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, were reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area was occasionally reported, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledroneic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extractions or other dental attacks.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Patients with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaws of a patient treated with Aclasta and a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of an overdose which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 females aged between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) T-score for the Schenkelhals ≤ -2,5 with or without signs of an existing spine fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric fractures of the spine were significantly reduced over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% lower risk of vertebrate fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta had a consistent effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar vertebrae, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of bone density of lumbar spine by 6.7%, total hip by 6.0%, lower than 5.1% and distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology At 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic bone one year after the third annual dose.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone-volume and the retention of trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-telopeptid (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 intervals during duration of study.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Aclasta reduced significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was maintained at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was maintained at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. oral or intramuscularly) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Acupsta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased BMD at the overall hip and Schenkelhals at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Acupsta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo treatment by 5.4% compared to placebo treatment and 4.3% at the Schenkelhaller.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was judged after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to reduce clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once-weekly administration of Alendronat was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta has been studied in patients and patients aged more than 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mainly light to moderately heavy clay Paget of the bone (medium serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2.6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of infusion of 5 mg of Zolenic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of rischronate once a day for 2 months was proved in two six-month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month study were included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with aclasta and 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was maintained at 141 of patients treated with aclasta, compared to 71 of the patients treated with Risedronath during an average follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zolenronic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Afterwards, the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long formation phase with a terminal exclusion period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearing amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration at the time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance of metabolized substances is unlikely to be metabolized by cytochromes because it is not metabolized in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see Section 4.2) correlated the renal Clearance of the cioledron, 75 ± 33% of the creatinin-clearing, and in the 64 examined patients in mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function malfunction down to a creatinine clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the oledron acid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because there is only limited data for severe kidney function disorder (Creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest dose-effective intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and with rats 0,6 mg / kg of body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies in dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC six times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of Zoledronacid was administered in rats using doses of 0.6 mg / kg in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose, which corresponds to the 7x of human-therapeutic exposure, relative to the AUC, corresponding to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to accumulated expositions that exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in studies of repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphor of long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats, teratogenicity was observed in rats from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially oestrogens that are formed from androgens, play a role in the more gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget, bone reconstruction takes place too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta works by normalising bone reconstruction in order to ensure normal bone formation and thus reinforces the bone.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public evaluation report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) has evaluated the conducted studies in order to get recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) where metformin (a diabetic drug) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), metformin alone cannot be satisfactorily set in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonyl harnate or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonyl harnate or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonyl harnate or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and blood sugar levels decline, allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was examined; patients received a combination of metformin with sulfa drugs, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced when using dosages of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional dose of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and sulphonyl resins decreased by 0.94%, while the additional placebo arm resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin received a lowering of HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% among the patients who took additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypoesthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be applied to patients who may react hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos in the framework of a monotherapy (at the sole use) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the placing of Actos in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marker" "" "15" "" "and on the other hand the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the use in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema if Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with Pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and previous advanced makrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of congestive heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated output liver cells (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels will be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone should be continued until the laboratory parameters are performed by clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can stem from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction of the middle hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and haematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under therapy with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3-4%) and reduced hemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocrits by 1-3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral double or triple combination therapy with a sulphonyl harnate or as a two-way combination therapy with insulin have the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, the treatment with thiazoldindia, including pioglitazone, was reported to reduce visual acuity in diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report on disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning bone fractures randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of being pregnant, and if a patient wants pregnancy or she is pregnant, the treatment must be removed (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies evaluating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxine, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines, which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reduction inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrosis (a cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the pregnancy resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not invaluable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refractive index of the lens, as it can also be observed in other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege on the triples of the upper limit of the normal range were often similar to placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resins.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with existing advanced makrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure in Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo if Pioglitazone or Pioglitazon was.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, heart failure was rarely reported under Pioglitazone, but more often when Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of reports of adverse events with regard to bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients were performed in groups treated with comparative media.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occured.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have an effect on the activation of specific nuclear receptors (PPAR-γ), which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fatty and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucosamine production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose improvement in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclagenocide as monotherapy was continued over two years in order to study the time up to the treatment effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8,0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclagenocide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was inadequate with insulin despite a three-month optimization phase were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinine quotients proved statistically significant in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18 week investigation of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol levels as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical studies over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasma glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide and increased HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels observed under Pioglitazon, while lower values were observed under metformin and liclacide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the triglyceride levels but also improved the postystal increased triglyceride level, which is both an effect on triglyceride level and hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and previous advanced macular macular disease were randomized into groups that received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, with peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma typically 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the triple of the efficacy of Pioglitazone whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it could be proven that pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxine, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrosis (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive marker pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-exclusion period of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and that of the entire active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral secretion of the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agreed with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible excentric cardiac hypertrophy after repeated dosing of plasma volume enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the formation of hyperinsulin and increased insulin resistance in the mother animal and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for reddish growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other Thiazoldindia led to increased frequency of colon tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures were performed at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0,5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study more than two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were studied with Pioglitazone or Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies more than 1 year a statistically significant decrease of the albumin / creatinine quotients proved statistically significant in comparison to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the triglyceride levels but also improved the postystal increased triglyceride level, which is both an effect on the tryglyceride level and the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the overall mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankles, coronary aronarynchronisation and reascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that cardiovascular long-term risks are not associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actrophane was examined in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes where the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">The study measured the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after 12 weeks, indicating how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actrophane did lead to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, suggesting that blood sugar levels were similar to that of another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actrophane should not be used in patients who may react hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actrophane may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (see the full list of products).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of actraphane in the treatment of diabetes outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued approval to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the marketing of Actrophane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial effect is desired together with a longer lasting effect.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly, for example by intensified insulin therapy, can change hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should therefore be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin, insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (by recombinant DNA against islandic origin) may cause a change in dosing.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Actrophane, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different compared to their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of oropharyngeal ulcera.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleedings or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract, except for pyloroplastics, are given only with special caution (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, ösophageal ulcera and ösophageal erosions, rarely followed by bad fractures, were reported in patients receiving alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malignant reactions, and patients should be pointed out, in case of symptoms of malignant irritation such as dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn of the medicine and obtaining medical advice (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe oesophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it following the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an astophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronat no increased risk was found, stomach and duodenal ulcera were rarely reported (after market introduction), including some serious and with complications (see Section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the intended day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be treated adequately before the start of the therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can impair the absorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronat, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendronat was taken in clinical trials in conjunction with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs without having clinically relevant interactions.</seg>

<seg id="1322">It consisted of two placebo-controlled studies where alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg. daily either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebrate contour by 47% (Alendronat 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption Based on intravenous reference dose, the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate was 0.64% for women between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours before starting a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronat was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis, alendronate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day over five days) led to no clinically meaningful change in oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in the mean range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 Distribution studies in rats show that Alendronat is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after intravenous injection of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly redistributed to the bone or excreted with the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After intravenous administration of a single dose of 14C alendronate approximately 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the fables.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal Clearance of Alendronat was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, Alendronat is not excreted via the acid or alkaline transport system of the kidneys, and therefore it is not accepted that it affects the excretion of other medicines by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1335">Excretion In the absence of radioactively marked vitamin D3 in healthy volunteers mean the mean excretion of radioactivity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4%, in the fences after 4 days 4.9%.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients with preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate that is not deposited in the bone is quickly removed from the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although no clinical data is available, it is still expected that the renal elimination of alendronate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Therefore, patients with reduced kidney function can expect a slightly increased cumulation of alendronate in bone (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical trial were presented to 668 patients with kidney transplantation where the application of Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin was compared.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was rejected after a treatment duration of one year (for example by examining how often a new transplant or resumption of dialysis was required).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter follow-up studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant were carried out and examined how adventif is taken up by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only physicians who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dose; formulations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of adventia should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood-reflection provisions (see below) Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the tacrolimus-tallow levels should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after switching.</seg>
<seg id="1416">In day 4, systemic exposure, measured as tallow level, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the tacrolimus tallow levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate night ransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As tacrolimus is a low-clearing substance, an adaptation of the advant dose can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application For suppression of graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral adventif therapy should start with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments can be necessary later as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change during the course of the patient's stabilization after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral adventif therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Recommended dosage: conversion from Prograf to Advent must be converted from twice daily dose of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of adventif, so this conversion will take place in a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), based on the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressants to adventif once a day, treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplants must commence for the prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant is an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day once a day for adult patients who are converted to adventis.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Although there is no clinical experience with adventis in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patients, patients in a oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and on colorectal transplants are used in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood flow levels in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunctions a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with impaired renal function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of serum creatine levels, a calculation of the creatine condition and monitoring of urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switch from Ciclosporin to adventif When switching from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy, be careful (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the level of blood in the whole blood The dose should primarily be based on clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the help of thoroughbred-tacrolimus-talc controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the tacrolimus tallow during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-tallow levels of tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, dose adjustment, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or concurrent application of substances that could change the tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low clearing, adjustments of the dose may need several days until the steady state has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, Tacrolimus's tallow levels in the first time after liver transplantations are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of kidney and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that can occur as a result of tacrolimus under or over exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dose; formulations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be therapy-resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf for prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart transplants and transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that can lead to a reduction of the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), or other herbal remedies during treatment with adventif (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, as the tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, a aqueous or septum hypertrophy referred to as cardiomyopathy was observed under Prograf, which is therefore also possible under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the potential risk of malignant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and, consequently, increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore advisable to monitor the tacrolimus blood levels while adding substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the tacrolimus dose to maintain constant concentrations (see Section4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interaction was associated with antifungal such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole and with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio-availability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed Prednisolone or Methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 Hemmer; therefore, the concurrent application of tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 which interfere with metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the clearing of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the level of hormone exfoliation, decisions on contraceptive action must be taken particularly cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus could potentially lessen the clearances of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialyzable.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphokin genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, and also the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1481">175 trial transplanted patients, with 475 patients undergoing a pancreatic transplantation and in 630 cases after an intestinal transplant as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to the observations in the large trials in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral Prograf, over 110 patients were reported to receive either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin in 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterate syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with tacrolimus, in 21.7% of cases the incidence of bronchiolitis was compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients being converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which no acute graft rejection occurred was increased after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the incidence of bronchiolitis's obliteration syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multi-center study with oral Prograf was performed on 205 patients who underwent a pancreas and kidney transplant, receiving a randomised procedure Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral Prograf as primary immunosuppressant after intestinal transplants showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of tacrolimus, leading to tallow between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmed et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations, leading to an increase in the unbound faction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion occurs mainly through bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than Prograf in stable patients treated by Prograf (twice daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg) to the total daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advant is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (due to the deficiency of factor VIII conditioned, congenital hemorrhage disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Advances are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding in the case of surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A are suffering from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced using a method called "recombinant DNA technology":</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that enables it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to a medicine approved in the European Union, called Recombinate, but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the drug application was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood points with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Adva must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a permit for the transport of lawyers across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy are based on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injected every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injected every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the danger for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of Factor VIII plasma levels is recommended to control the dose and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis On long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.E. are to be given by factor VIII per kg body weight in a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should depend on the patient's condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against Factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, where the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and an amnestic known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low-triangular) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs occurring in the largest number of patients were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients), which show a higher risk of the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-level was observed postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout time and both the factor VIII- Mirror in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and prior exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days with ADVATE.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 pediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) reported a FVIII inhibitor after exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients from an ongoing clinical trial, 5 out of 25 (20%) were treated with ADVATE inhibitors against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibodies against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell proteins, otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred which indicated an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients, the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophile granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE has reported hypersensitivity reactions of allergic type including anaphylactic / anaphylaktoid reactions (frequency not known).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated factor VIII acts as a co-factor for the activation factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X from factor X.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were performed on pre-treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline of factor VIII activity ≤ 2%).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP continues to evaluate the benefit-risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP on the basis of ADVATE's security profile, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, has decided that the authorisation holder is to apply another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited handed over to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company accepts its application for approval for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breasts, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus which has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is an" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been changed so that it does not produce copies of itself and thus does not trigger infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin should have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body normally contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and the killing of the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of the abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the company's answers to the questions asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the documents submitted at the beginning, the CHMP generates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors provides benefits for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not sufficiently proved that advexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notify the CHMP if the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Competitive Use" programmes with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "altered drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly released over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clapped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be relied on the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a journal and assessed with a standard scale how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who received Aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving disloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chase), mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may also not be used in patients suffering from congestion glaucoma (elevated intraocular pressure), urinary tract (aggravated urination), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrospinal fluid), hyperthyroidism (cerebral stroke) or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the marketing of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is swallowed whole (i.e. without breaking, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not continue after sound of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After a decrease in the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with Desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors resp. within the 2 weeks following completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasocripitin, pergolid, lisurid, cabarolin, ergotamine, dihydroergotamine or other decanonctiva, which can be used peroral or nasal as a waving Rhinoplasty (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy was not checked for this patient's collective and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data is not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertonia or tachycardia or palpitations, heart rhythm disorders, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or amplification of headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertonia • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to be removed at least 48 hours before the performance of dermatological tests, as antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or to reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical exams with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor testing showed no significant differences between patients treated with desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin is not inhibiting in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibitory and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of Aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to a lightheadedness which can lead to impairment of traffic injury or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letterings.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravated mition, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (mouth dry, pupil stiffness and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">At a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of fluid performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, no increased frequency of drowsiness was found in the recommended dosage of 5 mg per day compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine-antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the total scores for the symptoms (except nasal mucous swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, desloratadin can be detectable within 30 minutes of the plasma administration.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the flow equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out as tablet on healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects disloratadin changed badly.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine following the exclusive administration of pseudoephedrine is equivalent to exposure to an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin can not detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / Pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the filings application described pharmacovigilance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, to unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose, and tearing or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed with Aerinaze: • High blood pressure • Cardiac chase, palpitations • Cardiac arrhythmia • nausea and headaches or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you take Aerinaze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is non-prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Traffic tightness and operating of machines In the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that Aerinaze leads to lightheadedness or lowers the attention.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash have been reported rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chases, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, cases of inflammation of the liver and cases of conspicuous liver strains has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophiisat for taking (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for capturing.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies involving approximately 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by determining the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrants, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution for taking and the enamel tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius led to an average decrease in the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% among the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urticaria, the decline of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius was 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius mustn't be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, Loratadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe to approve the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">A tablet once a day, with or without a meal, for alleviating symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies of efficacy in the use of desloratadin in young people aged 12 to 17 (see Section4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resumed in their recovery.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persisting allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, taking Aerius and alcohol has not increased the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases, lightheadedness can result, which can lead to impairment of traffic injury or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical studies in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius in the recommended dose of 5 mg, compared to patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported in placebo were fatigue (1.2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical trial of 578 young patients aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was headache. this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multidose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described in a clinical study involving multiple doses of up to 20 mg per day in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study in which desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg. a day (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg demonstrated no influence on standard measurement parameters of fluid performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes and itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can be classified as an alternative to the duration of the symptoms as well as in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis are defined as the occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology despite the etiology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recruited simply prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histaminfection is a causative factor in all urticellarial diseases, it is expected that in addition to the chronically idiopathic urticaria, desloratadin also leads to improvement in symptoms in other forms of urticaria. this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistaminika was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improvement of the itch around more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and vigilance, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, where patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population were comparable, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation, once daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibitory and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie-rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies conducted with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with desloratadin can not detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Coloured film (includes lactose-monohydrate, hypromworthless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigo carmine (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromworthless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, lightweight wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratadin and experience higher levels of substance (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between the ages of 2 and 11 is identical to that of children who are metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This medicine contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, taking Aerius tablets and alcohol has not increased the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the Aerius syrup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% side effects reported in patients with Aerius were reported in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multidose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti-histamine therapy received a daily desloratadmondosis of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the progression of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical pharmacological study of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, there was no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1779">For a single daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents showed no impairment of psychomotor activity in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies in adults, the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not result in increased drowsiness due to the increase in alcohol-induced performance impairment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes and itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As demonstrated by the total scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metabolizing phenotype was comparable to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasian (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multidose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are metabolized without restriction.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) caused by desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life time of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for a clinically relevant drug congestion after once daily application of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 different single dose studies showed that the AUC and CMAx values of desloratadin were comparable to those recommended in pediatric patients with those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics left the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to announce that the company accepts its application for Aflunov's marketing application in order to prevent aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and older people to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that might cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because humans have not yet built up immunity (no protection).</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus that are contained in the vaccine as a "foreign body" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this trunk.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface identified as foreign to the human body) was purified, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"" "a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not conducted according to" "" "good clinical practice" "" "(GCP)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus of Type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenera is available as a solution to intake, but it cannot be taken together with ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Amgenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined what antiviral drugs the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day, which are taken together with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice a day and with other antiviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenera is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, amgenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases related to AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Amgenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The medication used with low doses of ritonavir was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to take protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the viral load change after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously not taken any protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo, but amgenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, asterase also reduced viral load, but only a few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine Agenerase increased viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as well as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">Patients with HIV, which were resistant to four other protease inhibitors, met with Ritonavir together with Ritonavir for four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (nausea), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 generases may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">It may also not be used in patients who use St. John's Wort (a herbal supplement to treat depression) or medicines that are broken down just like asgenerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take asterase are the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of amgenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children treated with protease inhibitors outweigh the risks over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Amgenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic reinforcer Ritonavir, but the committee found that the use of amgenerase in combination with ritonavir in patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "amgenerase was originally licensed under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because only limited information was required at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited Company a permit for the placing of aserase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Amgenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenera should be administered to the pharmacokinetic booster of amprenavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place considering the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir capsule; therefore, amgenerase capsules and solution for capturing on a milligram per milligram are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dosage for Agenerase capsules amounts to 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of amgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amprenavir / kg bodyweight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of amgenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Amgenerase is not recommended for children under 4 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenera capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Amgenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Plant preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and reduced therapeutic effects of amprenavir during intake of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be cautioned that amgenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with amgenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of the simultaneous anti-viral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing reduced liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of amgenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of asterase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to increased risk of Myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regardised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, amgenerases may be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium deficiency, especially if at the same time low doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity caused by the high propylene glycol content of the Agenera solution for inclusion, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Amgenerase should be removed in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases to which therapies were needed to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, like a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophile patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hematthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In the case of HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can lead to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial eology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), osteoarthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450 Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir may not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly confused with CYP2D6 and associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the degraded plasma levels by a dose-increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, adverse reactions to the liver were frequently observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be degraded by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's Wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nelfinavir is administered together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% Increased, for CMAx reduced by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg of amprenavir were applied twice daily and ritonavir 100 mg twice a day, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% degraded when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caloric acid (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended a close-meshed surveillance as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study on the use of asgenera in combination with dianosine, but is recommended due to the anagenetic component of dianosine that the revenue of Didanosin and Agenerase is at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapin may lower the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised, as Delavirdin could be less effective because of reduced or potentially subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The concurrent application of amprenavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentrations (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with asgenerase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin should be at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however the plasma levels of both medicines could be elevated in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily resulted in an increase of the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2.69fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once daily without simultaneously using Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may, if used together with asgenerase, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with asgenera.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data from other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as amgenerase as it can result in resorption of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzyme ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers, such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifethipin, nifedipine, nifethipin, nifedipine, nifethipin, nifedipine, nifethipin, nifedipine, nifethipin, nifedipine, nifethipin, nifedipine, nifethipin, nifedipine, nifethipin, nifedipine, nifethipin, nifethipin, nife</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent amgenerase intake can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and increase with PDE5 inhibitors in combination with hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, concurrent amgenerase with Ritonavir together with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are pronounced increases in plasma levels combined with concurrent amgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasmasking increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including a rhubdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">A more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilising the mirror is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased by adding amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, it should not be used together with orally captured Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while the simultaneous use of amgenerase is required with parenteral Midazolam caution.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteaseinhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam for 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">When methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium deficiency, especially if lower doses of Ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the very low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation is currently available, as amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asgenera, increased control of INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended by simulating asterase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactose-related rats, amprenavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether amprenavir survives in people's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, given to amprenavir from the implantation in the uterus until the end of the lactation period, showed a diminished increase in the 12 weight of the offspring during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the descendants including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of amgenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most associated side effects associated with Agenerase treatment were mild to moderately pronounced, rising early and rarely leading to the discontinuation of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to taking amgeneracy or other drugs used to treat HIV, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROF3001, PROAB3006), in which not pre-treated patients received 1200 mg of asgenerase twice a day with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were classified as related to study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) were performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and peripheral fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation (breastfeeding).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretrovirally untreated persons who had been treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 in 245 NRTIs compared to 27 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderately pronounced, erythematous or macro-papulous nature, with or without itching and generally disappeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In the case of HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency, an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections can be developed at the time of initiating antiretroviral therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI previously treated patients who received 600 mg of amgenerase twice daily along with low dose Ritonavir (Grade 3 and 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4), which were observed among all amgenera treatment, were very common in patients who received amgenerase along with low dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In the event of an overdose, the patient must observe an indication of an intoxication (see Section 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the process of viral gene and gag-pollen polyprotein levels resulting from a formation of unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and inhibiting HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral therapy with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir-dosages - as in other Ritonavir toosterten treatment schemes with proteaseinhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg Fosamprenavir with 100mg ritonavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, I62V, A71V, V77I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) to patients with protease inhibitors occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic analysis systems based on genotypic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, M36I, I84V and L90M in combination with increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir and a reduced likelihood of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutations may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretations systems for analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic analysis systems based on phenotypic resistance tests can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant insulates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs (separations) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance to Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir generally remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral non-pretreated patients with a Fosamprenavirus (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir at the beginning of treatment and another against Tipranavir), indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 Isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 Isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 Isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early breakage of a failing therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The efficacy of amgenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study, in which PI pretreated adults with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard of care (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Sixty-one sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to asgenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir in comparison with the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-captive threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of efficacy of unbleached amgenera is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of whom 152 had been pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenera was tested three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose of ritonavir was given at the same time; most of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with amgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on these data, therapy optimisation should be considered with PI pretreated children of the expected benefit of "undesired" amgenera.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the average duration (tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for CMAx by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal results in a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, minimal concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous eating intake was influenced by the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the active substance in plasma, with the amount of incomplete amprenavir which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of incomplete amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component in the dosing intervals varies depending on the total-drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 need to be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with amgenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The dose of Agenera capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is available from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, amgenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not replaceable on a milligram base.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearances of Ritonavir are also negligible, so the effects of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity of amprenavir in mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas occurred in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8-fold (rat) exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the genesis of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">The present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application, showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vitro and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), mouse-lymphom test, microcore test of rats and chromosome aberrations tests on human peripheral lymphocytes were neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical daily life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Up to now, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of amgenerase after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality rate in both the control and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to humans, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes, which indicate a delayed development, were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the addition of Ritonavir (booster), higher doses of amgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules amounts to 20 mg of amprenavir / kg bodyweight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use should be taken with caution in patients with poor or mild liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regardised Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with caloric acid (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of Ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended a close-meshed surveillance as the efficacy and safety of this combination is unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When these drugs are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin along with asgenerase, a reduction in the dose of rifabutin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data is available for this.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nimodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, niepdipine, and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">In the simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asgenera, increased control of INR (International Norised Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg Ethinylestradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin from amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">On the other hand, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, it should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI in the expected benefit of "undesired" amgenera.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound Amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the overall drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions to the patient are causing great discomfort or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical trial, patients with more than 8 active lesions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, ismiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although no quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were achieved, no recommendation could be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly reported and probable or possibly associated with the application of imiquimodine creme in related side effects in the trials involving three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the location of the treatment of the tilt warts (33.7% of patients treated with iodquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most frequently reported and probable or possibly associated with the application of imiquimodine cream in connection with side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The 185 with imiquimodine-cream treated basalioma patients from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse event, possibly or possibly with the application of imiquimodine-cream, were in these studies a response to the application location (22% of patients treated with iodquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with imiquimodine-cream treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">These placebo-controlled clinical trials showed that these placebo-controlled clinical trials with imiquimodine-cream often lead to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excloriation / leaves / shed (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of the clinical signs provided according to the test plan shows that in these studies five times weekly treatment with imiquimodine cream often resulted in severe erythemums (31%), severe erosions (13%), and severe deformation and calcidity (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was noted with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental one-off oral recording of 200 mg ismiquimod, corresponding to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most severe side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia, normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines were detected after topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies, efficacy was clearly superior to a complete healing of the tilt warts in imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of all patients who were treated with imiquimodine, the tilt warts healed completely; this was the case with 20% of the patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">Imiquimodine's efficacy in five times a week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary supernormal basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients had clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Imiquimodine's efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic ac- lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 of treatment area on the hairless scalp or in the face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The results from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications external bias, actinic keratosis and supernormal basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was examined in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses taken there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic assimilation of the 5% imiquimodine cream by the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and betrugen 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of ismiquimod was low after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients aged 6-12 years and was comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or supernormal basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity at the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG showed a significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study for dermal application conducted four months showed no similar effects in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism is not known, but since imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, it is a risk for humans to look very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in larger number than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed side effects you have significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not listed in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feignices (condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the area of genitalia (sexual organs) and anus (after) ● superficial Basal cell carcinoma This is a frequently encountered, slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can lead to distortion, especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratosis are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their previous life.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should be used only for flat actinic keratosis in the face and on scalp in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara cream supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratosis or the virus responsible for the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have previously applied Aldara cream or other similar preparations, please inform your doctor about this before starting with the treatment. o Informate your doctor if you have problems with your immune system. o Use Aldara Cream only if the area to be treated is cured after a previous drug or surgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2249">Do not use more cream than your doctor prescribed you. o If reactions occur in the treated area after applying Aldara Cream, wash the cream with a mild soap and water.</seg>
<seg id="2250">Once the reactions are cleared, you can continue the treatment. o Find your doctor if you have no normal blood picture</seg>
<seg id="2251">If this daily cleansing is not performed under the foreskin, swelling, fertilisation of the skin or difficulties can be expected when retracting the foreskin.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not use Aldara cream in the urethra, in the vagina (vagina), the cervix (cervix) or within the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">If other medicines have serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have sexual intercourse in the genital area during the infection, the treatment with Aldara cream is to perform after sexual intercourse (not before).</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied, even if it is non-prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not quench your infants during treatment with Aldara Cream, as it is not known whether imiquimod occurs in breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of inclination, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratosis (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the tilt warts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully covered.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with warts under the foreskin must withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area under it (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before the application of Aldara cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please contact your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">A sufficient amount of Aldara cream should be applied for 6 weeks each week to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>
<seg id="2262">Very common side effects (expected in more than 1 out of 10 patients) Frequent side effects (expected to be expected in less than 1 out of 100 patients) rare side effects (expected in less than 1 out of 100 patients) Very rare side effects (expected in less than 1 out of 10,000 patients)</seg>
<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor / health care professional or pharmacist immediately if you do not feel well during the application of Aldara Cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin reacts too strongly to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream further, wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A lower number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to develop a blue stain more quickly or cause depression.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Inform your doctor or pharmacist if one of the listed side effects is significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you can feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied to Aldara Cream (8% of the patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions, which end up again within 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally, some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scoring, skin irritation, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen areas in the skin, tingling, feeling of pain or discomfort), sore throat, diarrhea, actinic keratosis, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme substitute therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, aggravating movements, decreased lung capacity, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or a hospital with revitalizing equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicine before the administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years Aldurazyme reduced GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat, fever and reactions to the infusion area.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information, which may be known, and update this summary, where necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyms in terms of reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Aldurazyme to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -l-ion-idase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a doctor who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in single steps.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosage schedule could be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions defined as any adverse event occurring during infusion or until the end of the infusion-day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitalizing facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">As a result of the Phase 3 clinical trial, almost all IgG antibodies against laronidase are expected to form, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be cautiously performed after an interruption of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">Pretreat 60 minutes before the onset of infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyreagents) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of light or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusion-related reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procain, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular image of Laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data in newborns exposed to laronidase over breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as infusion-related responses, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with Aldurazyme observed during Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or over at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are very common (≥ 1 / 10); often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions including bronchospasm, breathing stillness and face oedema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with mainly severe expiration and treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconversion was performed within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment, whereby the patients at the age of 5 were usually diagnosed with a seroconversion within one month (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 trial (or up to early excretion from the study), 13 / 45 patients showed no antibodies being detected by radioimmunooplecturing (RIP), including 3 patients in which there was never a seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a lack of up to a low antibody level showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in urine was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal or low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro, which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme substitute therapy lies in the hydrolysis of the accumulating medium and preventing further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes most likely via manose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study involving 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of the patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the serious phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change in the expected FEV and the total distance in the 6-minute walking test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study, where they received a further 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and salviability shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects from up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes further increased proportionally to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) achieved a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the GAG-Spiegel was observed in the urine (µg / mg kreatinin), which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients, which was taken into account by using a combined endpoint, which summarized clinically significant changes across the range of five efficacy variables (anticipated percentage of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walking test, range of movement of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were studied in 20 patients, who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a growth rate (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were found after the Z-score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of expiration (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form had a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe expiration were limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazymetry dosing schemes were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule of 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may represent a reasonable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with unique ability, toxicity with repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data can not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "anti-emetic" (drugs against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent dehydration) should be given before or after the administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood picture changes or when certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, stopped or the dose can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetremixed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetremixed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural mesothelioma, Alimta was studied in a major study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another cancer against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin had an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months with docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, both studies showed patients who did not attack the squamous cells during the administration of Alimta for longer survival compared to the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the placing of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The appropriate volume of the necessary dose is removed and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) administered intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg / m ² KOF administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the pemetremixed application as well as the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetremixed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first pemetremixed dose as well as after each third movement cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving mixed blood, a complete blood picture should be created before each Gift - including a differentiation of the leukocytes and a platelet of thrombocyte.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">A dose examination must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking into account the Nadirs of the blood picture or the maximal non-haematological toxicity of the predictive therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria reflect the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients with non-haematological toxicity develop ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be stopped with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be stopped if a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose ducts or - on the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or higher compared to 65 years of age there is an increased risk risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatine-clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatine-clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-times of the upper Biliruby limit and / or transamination values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit (for liver metastases) or &gt; 5,0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone immunosuppression and pemetremixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils regain a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on Nadir of the absolute neutrophis, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetremixed must be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce stress-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous use of non-steroidal antiphlogistika (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with a pemetremixed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with these events had appropriate risk factors for the incidence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with a clinically significant liquid retention in the transcellular space a drainage of the ergometer is to be considered before the pemetremixed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with pemetremixed when this compound was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the concurrent application of attenuated vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of irreversible peeling of the reproductive capacity by means of Pemetremixed, men should be pointed out before the treatment plan to obtain advice on how to protect the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">High doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) lead to reduced pemetremixed elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advised if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are applied in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">(ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetremixed avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-value such as piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with pemetremixed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regular Ratio), when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetremixed in pregnant women, but as for ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed must not be applied during pregnancy except if necessary and after careful consideration of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversibly damaging the reproductive capacity by means of Pemetremixed, men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm cells.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetremixed is passed into the breast milk and unwanted effects on the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomised cisplatin and pemetremixed patients as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who randomized cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2430">Cases of radiotherapy were reported in patients who were irradiated before, during or after their sequential treatment (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is an antineoplastic antifolate which performs its effect by interrupting important, folate-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetremixed acts as an antifolate with multiple points of attack by blocking the thymidylatynthase (DHFR), Dihydrofolatrereductase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotide for- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis by thymidine and purdelucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomized, easy-blind Phase 3 study by ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus cisplatin with malignant pleural amesothelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage over a median 2.8-month extended survival compared to those patients who were only amusing with Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the investigational medication in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of the clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleuramesothelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared to the exclusive Cisplaintin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two treatment arms showed an improvement in the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a worsening of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A median survival time of 8.3 months with ALIMTA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was a median survival time of 8.3 months with patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>

<seg id="2504">Patients who take Alli and who do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise some fats in the food, causing roughly a quarter of the fats that have been fed to the food undigested the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to placebo in 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received 60 mg of alli had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year, compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no adverse weight loss could be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots on the anus, flatus (winch) with studs, bowels, oily / oily chair, indulgence of oily secretions (fences), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be used in patients treated with ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients who suffer from a long-term malabsorption syndrome (not enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or suffer from cholestasis (liver disease), and pregnant women or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body Mass Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokaline, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only resorbed to minimal, elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adjustment of the dosage is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.6) • Pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As the weight reduction in diabetes is accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic needs to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional precautionary measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in the event of severe diarrhoea (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A reduction in Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed in both a study on drug interactions and in several cases with the simultaneous use of orlistat and ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the use of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (internationally normal-ised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">Most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as beta carotene in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin content (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose of ammiodarone, a minor decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed with a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological effect of the drug as the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not priceless).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side effects noted after the launch of orlistat is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The majority of reported cases of orlistat overdose reported after the launch were reported to have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on tests on humans and animals, a quick recovery of any systemic effects caused by the lipase inhibitory properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect settles in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin remainder of the gastre and pankreatic lipass.</seg>
<seg id="2536">It was derived from clinical studies that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 confirm the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaline, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those study participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both trials, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first six months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist measurement the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting point 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, metabolized orlistat in plasma was only sporadic and extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Laconring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl-Leucine group), were identified in a study with obese patients, representing nearly 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity, canogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data can no longer be recognized by humans.</seg>

<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules, resulting in increased fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment starts, as at this time you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize dietary supplements: • Begin for a few days, or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat-reduced diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the servings you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you exceed your fat limit is likely to exceed your fat limit. • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an anti-emetic drug).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended because there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the substance inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies Aloxi was studied in 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients who were treated with alopia showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients who were treated with alopia showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and for prevention of nausea and vomiting with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of aloples for the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As Palonosetron can prolong the intestinal prompt, patients with anamnestial obstination or signs of a subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists caution is advised with simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi should not be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five examined chemotherapeutics (Cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, doxorubicin and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial, there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady state- concentration of oral metastasis, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, it was shown that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (amiodarone, celecoxib, chlorpromaine, cimetidine, paroxetine, chinidine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences regarding the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies are not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were reported at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly related to Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstination (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions at the place of administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dose, similar frequencies of adverse events were seen as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-active relationships to be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out, but due to large distribution volumes a dialysis is probably not an effective therapy with an alopia overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of palonosetron were given, given intravenously to day 1 without dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients receiving a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron were compared to patients given intravenously to day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with medically emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was to assess the ECG-effects of palonosetron i.v. administered in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption following intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations, a slow elimination from the body with an average half-life time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC 0- ∞) are generally dose-related in total dose range of 0.- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of palonosetron in 3 consecutive days reached a total of 0.75 mg measured value; however, the CMAx was higher after one-off dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison with Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, are involved in the isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron approximately 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unmodified ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">The total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min after a single intravenous bolus injection in healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, terminal exclusion of the liver and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies effects were observed only after expositions that are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies indications are that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose met about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans), which were given daily for two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosage and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called" "" "Roferon-A" "", "which is already approved in the EU (called" "" "reference drug" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damage, besides, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Amino-ferase (ALT) are raised in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">Yeast produces a gene (DNA), which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data demonstrating the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of operation, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of alpheon was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the treatment after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after setting the treatment (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non business purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged What were the biggest concerns the CHMP have led to the recommendation to deny approval for the marketing?</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed does not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon the disease again increased to more patients than with the reference drug. in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate whether the drug is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It may be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crusts) and small infected infirings (crack or cutting), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections which have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age the area to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 patients (85,6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients were treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together by skin wounds, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it has been found that Altargo is not effective enough in treating abscesses (egg-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections that have been proven or presumably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (which has been observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) is a irritation at the job site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo outweigh the following superficial skin infections in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small laincts, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued approval to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. for the marketing of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and alternative therapy may be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or severe local irritation due to the use of Retapamine Salbe, the treatment should be stopped, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Reapamination should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary-infected open wounds the efficacy of retapamine in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2- or 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retapamine and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo cannot be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved in humans after topical application on skimmed skin or infected superficial wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 According to the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazol, the average Retapamination AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased after topical application of 1% Retapamination ointment to reduced skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, doses adjustments are not required when topical Retapamin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the effects on birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamine is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding continues / terminates or the treatment should be continued with Altargo, it is possible to weigh between the benefit of breast-feeding and the benefit of altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, which have applied altargo, the most reported side-effect irritation was at the administration point, which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retapamine is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomally interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved with the ribosome protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, pleuromutiline inhibits the transfer of peptide, partially blocks P-binding interactions and prevents normal development of active 50s-ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of retiname in at least some infections seems questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamine compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Dencocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Absorption In a healthy adult study, 1% Retapamination ointment was performed daily under occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamination ointment twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in people after topical application of 1% ointment to 200 cm2 of skimmed skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamination IC50 for PGP escapement.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro feroxidative metabolisms of retiname in human liver microsomites was mediated primarily through CYP3A4, with small involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro analysis on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat microcore test for in-vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">Neither male nor female rats showed signs of reduced fertility in oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans (topical application to 200 cm2 of skimmed skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3-times of estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 of the Marketing Authorisation Application (Version 6.2), works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix will be used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and that the vaccination plan can be carried out at the end of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the natural defense of the body), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and creates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the inoculated vaccine Twinrix adults, which has been approved since 1996, and has been the registered vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a three-dose vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix's adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix adults were also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional 208 children study, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">At between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children, Ambirix conducted a month after the last injection for the development of protective anti-antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six and a 12 month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be applied to patients who may react hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals / s.a. a permit for the marketing of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for prioritisation with Ambirix consists of two doses, with the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher vaccination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody levels are the same as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to hepatitis C vaccination may need a catch-up as protection, as they may also be protected by immune memory even in cases of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels following the primers, so that in these cases the administration of additional doses can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Because intradermal injection or intramuscular administration in the gluteal muscles could lead to a suboptimal success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, Ambirix can, however, be injected subcutanally, as in these cases, bleeding can occur after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection, administered simultaneously with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it is assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matefulness, gastroenteritis, headache and fever compared to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomeropathy and preservative formulation was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccination tins Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, Ambirix's compatibility with the 3-dose combination vaccine was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and toxicity on a basis for a calculation basis, but not on the basis of a calculation basis for each person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the gift of a dose of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given up Ambirix reported pain, compared to 63.8% among the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matefulness was comparable to per proband (i.e. over the total vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambience compared to 36.2% among the subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and toxicity was low and comparable to that observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 years of vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines that reported severe side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the ages of 1 to 15 years, the Seroconversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The Seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15 year olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was evaluated, the Seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the 3-dose-vaccine was significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1-11 year olds one month after completion of the full inoculation series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of primers, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction against both antigens was comparable to that observed after inoculation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalinactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial in 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies has been shown 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme compared to the 0-12-month vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambirix was given at the same time as a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussel, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar seroprotection and seroconversion rates for the current formulation as for the earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resuspening of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Pursuant to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC, the state charge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be conferred.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can manifest through itchy skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the scheduled administration of the second vaccine dosage).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per accent (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine for this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and will give you / your child a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix will be sprayed under the skin and not in the muscle if you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense / or if you / your child undergo hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you / your child is taking another medicine (including those you have received without prescription) or if you / your child has been vaccinated / has received / has received / has received / has received / has planned this in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as many limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix will not administer pregnant or breastfeeding women unless it is urgent that they be vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotics) in your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the scheduled appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambient is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on data known since issuance of the first approval for placing on the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix has been put into traffic only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in the prehistory of patients at the age of over one month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia endemic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentration).</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - split into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomy dish (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose) or a nose probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">This was not a comparative study, because ammonaps couldn't be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo, that is, without the active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also lead to loss of appetite, a abnormal acidity in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste problems or taste savor, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, skin rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disturbances in the urea cycle effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of admission only limited information was prescribed for this drug." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests after the first month of life), there is an indication for use when a hyperammonic encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">For patients suffering from an early deficiency of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithinleiscarcanylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccini-synthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk of the genesis of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate occurs over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats at high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal multiplication and increased loss of neurons occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve cells in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one undesired event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity during intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine can be compared with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with a disturbance of the urea cycle can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrate of 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine can be produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early-manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infectious, and the disease itself led to death even in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analoga within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the exploitation of alternative paths of nitrogen secretion (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenyl acetate), protein reduced and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in postpartum (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was with time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornithine transcarcanylase deficiency), which were recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further worsening of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in the liver and kidneys with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Concentrations of phenylbutyrate and metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism, and cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis by up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2846">According to different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) no phenylacetate in plasma was detectable in the morning after different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day).</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis of liver cirrhosis treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma levels were five times higher in the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100% in the form of conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus tests, sodium butyrate had no significant effects in rats with toxic and non-toxic doses (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules are either taken orally (babies and children who can't swallow tablets, or patients with difficulty swallowing) or via a gastrostomy or nose probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">For patients suffering from an early deficiency of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithinleiscarcanylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrate), lesions occurred in the cranial nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactate, severe hypokalemia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine can be compared with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the elimination of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances in the urea cycle, it can be assumed that the sodium phenylbutyrate of 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine can be produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further worsening of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrate in granular form 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of less than 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g of sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If your laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium phenylbutyrate can influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in instable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stress uplift" (an anomalous measured value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is given and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angioxox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often used a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent a closure) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks, or revascularization) after 30 days or one year as well as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent a PCI, angiox was as effective as heparin with regard to all indicators, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalidin, other hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that it was an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the placing of angioox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST attack infarction (IA / NSTEMI) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended starting dose of angioxin in patients with ACS is an intravenous release of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a further PCI is performed with the patient, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An injection of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered immediately prior to the procedure followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angioxox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous release of 0.75 mg / kg bodyweight and an immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolus administration of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed prior to use and administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min) that are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalidin against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is given and the ACT-5 minutes after the second beta dose must be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the application of the Bivalidin-Bolus without dose adjustment with an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with respect to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalidin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of cases of arterial puncture points occur in the case of PCI-patients under Bivalidin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can perform bleeding in principle everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients taking warfarin and being treated with a bivalidin, monitoring of the INR value (International Regardised Ratio) should be taken into consideration to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with bivalidin is regained once again prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the effective mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregate), these substances can increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalidin with platelet aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">In relation to the effects on the pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the detachment or the postnatal development are insufficient (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to bivalidin alone, 4604 were randomised to bivalidin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bienal rudin group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women as well as patients over 65 years of age were more susceptible to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Serious haemorrhages were defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding such as in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidendin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY serious hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area, reduction of hemoglobin mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known hemoglobin mirror, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed blood localizations, which occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" points of puncture, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bivalidin in 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bienal rudin group and in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, women and patients over 65 years of age were more prevalent than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are grouped in table 6 according to system classes.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the event of overdosing, the treatment with a bivalidin is immediately disconnected and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalidin, a direct and specific thrombosis inhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic centre and in the animate region of thromboin, regardless of whether thromboin is present in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of bivalidin to thromboin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because thromboin is slowly splitting the binding of bivalidin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalidin was not induced to induce thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, bivalidin shows a dose-dependent and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is evidenced by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from 6 years onwards with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm, or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human acting, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter working life than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In a study of 878 adults, Apidra was studied in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, indicating how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study in adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lisp was observed after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration decreased 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% in human noracting insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adapted if it is given together with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a permit for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as a subcutaneous injection either in the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of reduced glucosity capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with reduced liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active ingredient, the brand (manufacturer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc lag, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the method of production may change the insulin needs.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or termination of treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and a diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dose.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the effect profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency towards hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Disopyramid, Fibrate, Fluoxetine, Monoamin oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, saloxicylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, symptoms of adrenergic antiregulation can be alleviated or lacking under the effect of sympatholytics such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reserpine.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin enters into human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter into breast milk nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the undesirable medications known from clinical studies grouped by system components and arranged according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10; inestimable frequency based on available data).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration difficulties, drowsiness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Will be missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias involving unconsciousness can be treated by means of an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After glueing the patient in a hospital, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin the impact occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manic normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes myo- tus, insulin sensitivity in the therapeutically relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg showed a proportionate glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more, a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it became apparent that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a similar postgressional glycaemic control is reached, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, a better postgressive control was achieved than with a human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is applied 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, as with normal insulin analog, which is given 2 mids before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin administered 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin, 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the beginning of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisin administered 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
