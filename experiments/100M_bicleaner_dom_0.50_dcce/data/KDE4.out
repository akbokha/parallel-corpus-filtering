package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the Hand@@ book to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings extension .... Open the map card tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard settings from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules on your system are available if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page which &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available .
the module View filter ( also called Fol@@ der filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the top node of the document , example : document@@ element@@ .@@ All other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below the folder hierarchy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . to facilitate navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles also have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over View color mode can be either depth for the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it will be displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( although this may result in the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle ) .
with performance algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always respected . note that less space for the frame is lost when the rect@@ angle is square .
the layout of the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left up to the implementation . here , it is possible to divide the areas in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can define the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry above the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower item .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get designed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you view the gallery image gallery , a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows you to customize the title of the gallery page in a text input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;

to use the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
in the check box Hei@@ ght Color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images as in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML : settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Conf@@ quer@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu under Windows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Navigation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu or with the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ 9 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to play , click in the Navigation Pan@@ e of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
changing browser detection adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition , you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser detection of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you are coming to a web page that deny access to this browser , change browser detection to one of the following options .
changes the password to M@@ SI@@ E for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . editing skills can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and opportunities for improvement .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tries to make the reporting of problems or improvement proposals as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests .... This opens a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the Tro@@ ub@@ les@@ hooting system .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ .@@ In this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to find news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ cam ; to learn .
the best start to get involved &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to participate is logging in the developer mailing list . instructions to log in to the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
when you start &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . just enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file is stored . this path stays the same for all the image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will additionally use as al@@ bian library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; view any sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; cut the library path in its entirety . you cannot exclude any sub@@ folders unless it is hidden in hidden folders . this can be done by setting a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and dropping it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My key@@ word@@ list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , you may also deal with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Support menu .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flows .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ Photo@@ 2 library . of course , any media and card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
the ex@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the preview images . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ Photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to make the modules available to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to complete a function , when the changes in &amp; digi@@ cam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the al@@ b tree , above the horizontal partition line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be dropped in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus filtering on the file name only works if this is also displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Al@@ bian Settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos that were edited by &amp; digi@@ .@@ These albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ ign or after the date the album was created first . the date can be changed in the characteristics of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . to do this , select Album Im@@ por@@ tieren pictures . you can also add a screen shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can drag the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select album properties in the contex@@ tual menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos when you select from collection from the tool@@ bar or view albums sorted by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums and sort by date .
the buttons El@@ ders , A@@ verage , New Years : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
if you first recorded an album in &amp; edited , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . for collection always include all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo will be previ@@ ew@@ ed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album the first time , you must wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this in which you can recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each image is displayed below the preview . what information this is , you can edit via Settings ; set up . select the albums page and adjust the range of thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse cur@@ sor rest for a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the main window section shows such a help window .
albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can select all the features that are edited with &amp; digi@@ .@@ You can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... Select a guide how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu . for this , and how to adjust them to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing by other image editing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the image can occur . some programs do not store this data with when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select the rotation . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . be aware that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) .
if you select a photo from &amp; digi@@ pa@@ .@@ Del@@ ete , it will be moved to the bin folder by &amp; k@@ de ; Del@@ ete . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del . if you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift + Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ eli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ as@@ he@@ et at the bottom of the data view so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by this , you can organize your keywords logical . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the key words are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your keywords in other programs as soon as the data loss is lost , as soon as digi@@ ti@@ zed the images .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword , or on an existing keyword and then selecting New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword , after you cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , it becomes the sub@@ command of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting a keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you have chosen the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword , drag and drop them . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the preview images and select keyword from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can select a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keyword , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove from the menu . the menu only shows you the keywords that have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ dependent adjustment of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit . thus , all associated images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
if you click here , the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if you haven &apos;t found anything , then the lamp will turn red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be performed . the results will be used in the My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you only have to select the corresponding entry from my search list and select an option in its context menu .
when selecting Edit , the Search box appears again with the search information you entered . if you select As an advanced search , the dialog for the advanced search appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced Search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the context menu .
the Advanced Search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ .@@ s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group del@@ eting or deleted from it . any option can be linked to other via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they conform to . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one . by pushing a picture from anywhere on the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; finds the right pictures . even here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or zoom out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it . push it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this of course assumes that your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , including raw files .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L to add the lumin@@ escent from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ ous table and its window is opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L extras .
from the preview pane you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and place it there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is visible . if you want to synchron@@ ize preview from the tool@@ bar and carry out a zoo or im@@ position operations on one of the images , then these are also performed on the other image . you can therefore compare the same range of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures . if you use pairing mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparing . use now the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to see it in the left @-@ hand side . the right adjacent image is displayed in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images .
of course , normal fire @-@ out actions also work directly from the lumin@@ ous table as e.g. F@@ 4 file Edi@@ ting ....
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the lumin@@ escent table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swi@@ vel the visible area of the image , you have to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the preview mode , both images will be shown in the same image area .
the zo@@ oming will work as well as in other views . simply use the zoom controller under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; scroll to the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode .
digital stock management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken until the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos recei@@ pts , scans or digital photos cap@@ tures a form of digital stock management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and re @-@ use your images . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers which can back and use them . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , securing , evaluating , sub@@ stit@@ uting , archiving , optim@@ ising , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital stock management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transform@@ ations , conf@@ ers and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is based on your definition data that provides information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archive that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether you want to have other access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location , unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the metadata saving option in the metadata entry page . this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what if you want to change which ones ? for that purpose , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; they provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should assign keywords , labels and an evaluation to any photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos in the further work .
now let &apos;s proceed with keywords , keywords , as you often name in other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drawing a sub@@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping itself . this is a very rough representation , since every block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , to have associations , memories , the historical time span is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who consider your photos , the title is possibly more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE even provides you with a spell ch@@ ecker .
remember the times ahead of GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth ? well , because with images , the move of the spatial presentation now starts with speed of light .
I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . however , you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc , with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove constraints on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information on the setup page of &amp; digi@@ cam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s work description . examples of this can be titles such as : employee Phot@@ ograph@@ er , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here that you can see the image others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the image will be given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change this in the image . for individuals , this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique every picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : plate error , plate loss , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a brand . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , problems with the so @-@ called new media are concerned .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which cause data loss .
of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your discretion .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works wonders with CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
then you should read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store them on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that this media can read .
disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer warran@@ ts include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : disk error study
the most common error reason is S@@ MA@@ RT . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of the errors detected by S@@ MA@@ RT indicate the imminent failure . these are especially read errors and retention tags . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also avoid data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
during most electric appliances electric sho@@ cks don &apos;t matter much , this can be done differently in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause severe damage on your computer . thus , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable result to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember , however , that not every plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
because there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage spi@@ kes which also offer a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes them ideal for on @-@ the @-@ go .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruption @-@ free power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs . some models allow you to continue working until the current runs . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W U@@ PS you can pay for less than &amp; euro ; 40 .
the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies there is a backup and distribution included in the offer . thus , they are safe for des@@ ast@@ er@@ ism .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all trans@@ missions are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission fault occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day open a photo and this to your surprise is destroyed . no one seems ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at the moment , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year .
Z@@ FS by Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard under a license in@@ compatible with GP@@ L .
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . it is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms the Z@@ FS uses and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on the not@@ ebook and 46 % on work@@ station systems . in not@@ ebooks , the percentage of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to reduced damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time no one has been si@@ ghted .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , just the speed of the investigation process during a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been stored completely before the problem oc@@ cured , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings away from fundamental physical boundaries . this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not blame others for data loss . thus , your data is often affected by data loss every year . thus , backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , replacing plates or res@@ izing drives .
suppose you make daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crashes : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above is a common reason for loss of data despite backup the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : securing the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original state at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transmission scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were actually changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for the backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily release of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for every month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , original retain , store , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ discover images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is unfor@@ es@@ eeable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to let yourself be felt like the current system backwards . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : each time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and extended the range you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition . in * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record has been detected by the system , but do not hang it .

open source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , you can create them yourself . this task will become easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and a slow compression .
TI@@ FF is widely used as picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . with some cameras you can save your images in this format . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG Digital negative file format is a license @-@ free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the needs to uni@@ fy the camera formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and requires the use of metadata .
this is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive the original image , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits this because it saves the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera image , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it in your Roh@@ archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images , edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were under circumstances cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them into web galleries , code into MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . in the Ad@@ ding a photo to an album you will find a description on how to add photos you have already on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol are displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page strips properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that for some digital cameras not all information is available .
the metadata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s remark , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as for the metadata side bar of the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then the selection of all . downloading will not delete the photos and we suggest you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the download button and then select Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected download is gra@@ yed out until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option NEW is available . these images have not been edited by &amp; digi@@ .@@ In this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you can download all the buttons or download selected albums , a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed , as normal folder sorted . then select the list of the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK and &amp; &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you want to delete only some , you need to select them first and then delete them deleted .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so via the camera , as this is much faster .
the file names are normally re @-@ used after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can result in dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames , if you load photos of different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based bas@@ kets . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the first two relate the data about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can , for example , use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % d % d % H : % S in the editing area . to do so , switch the date &amp; time option . for further adjustments , you should read the help of str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ames , you have the option to change the file name in lo@@ wer@@ case or in upper@@ case if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which was edited and edited for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform an automatic turn during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to disable automatic turn , use the Exten@@ ded button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums on the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you have to disable this option . to do so , use the Exten@@ ded button and select the option Date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . then choose upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you , where the images are to be uploaded . a folder cho@@ oser dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in length and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser to indicate the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ pa@@ .@@ If you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , tra@@ ilers and map references .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format supported by the geographical assignment module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool from Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als ha@@ iry coordinates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; try to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; change . to access these settings , you need to change in the Settings menu ; set up . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the relevant IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s title : this field should contain the photographer &apos;s professional title . this may be desig@@ nations such as photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify which the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if he works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ . this achieves that metadata is permanently included in the image , and not only in the digi@@ ti@@ zed database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ .@@ It can be imported without being lost .
save image cap@@ tions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos , with the let@@ tering embedded in the images . this allows you to read your let@@ tering from other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests on a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ tization ; to indicate which file types &amp; digi@@ tization ; to show , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset again by clicking the Update button on the right of each category .
this page can be set to the default values . however , each time you open the lumin@@ ous table , these settings will be turned on . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you use image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to high compression .
this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality , since the Def@@ late algorithm is loss@@ less .
even if you select the loss @-@ free setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than the normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata hasn &apos;t been supported yet , but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only one image viewer for photos . at present , it is quickly becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing .
if you use this option , you solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option exc@@ els the image slightly sof@@ tly , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto @-@ color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance , which was photographed in the sunlight on a white card .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps gain more detail in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the standard is the tail@@ lights , so the parts of your images are burned into , because of the inability of your camera to catch the peak lights , as a continuous white . use the setting of transparent white in the settings . the setting colors release some unusual results , since they are the pointed @-@ lights in various ro@@ bes . finally , you can attempt to construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general don &apos;t satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or wh@@ ites you want .
if you select the option re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 , but this can also be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ pa@@ .@@ To keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should go conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the part raw data that comes from the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
and D@@ cra@@ w provides you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color sof@@ tening since you are done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions on how to be given again . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as colour information from a colour space in the other to translate so the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in the editing / color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Qu@@ it the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you store all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; examine these folders during startup .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
not all profiles are built in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain any color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate , as your picture may be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image , since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated .
for most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is provided for . unfortunately , not with Canon models . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a set of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewers and image editing . by picking up this interface , &amp; digi@@ cam ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be edited by &amp; digi@@ .@@ These modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .

the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper controller adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the display .
the camera features are shown on the left @-@ hand side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . this includes the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera bar .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , get it into the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; edited ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it will be displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ boards you can adjust the dialog by &amp; digi@@ .@@ When you delete a photo in an album , you will find more details when you delete a photo and delete an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly edited by &amp; digi@@ .@@ If you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without using any queries , otherwise you need to use the changes with the button to apply changes .
you can also display the display of the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed welcome screen ; when starting , this acceler@@ ates the boot of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; .
the setting At start looking for new photos forces &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you , if it should delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited ; used to customize the main window to your taste . you can select these settings using Settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :

&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; includes fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selection of the entry A@@ ds / Edi@@ ting .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ .@@ You may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the image processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , which shows file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a tool@@ bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using Save or Save the button Save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t restore the original photo as soon as you saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before changing it . you can do this with file saving as well .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery menu or the Rest@@ ore button to restore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you &apos;ve done on the photo since last saving .
virtually any editing of the image processing can be und@@ one or restored . undo the last action by modi@@ fying or restoring , by selecting Edit Rec@@ over from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for undo and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the Ret@@ re@@ at or Rest@@ ore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same Album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo in and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ larger factor automatically
view Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want this , you can change it in the editing dialog by &amp; digi@@ .@@ This can be viewed from &amp; edited ; main window . see the section for setting up image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File Image menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences . you only have to select the images from your selection . you only have to select the images using the standard methods and select print job from the menu album Ex@@ ports . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page header is available without the navigation arrows , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible , meaning that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are de@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
besides the use button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field of Re@@ gency . the code follows the diagram in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key word tree and a drop @-@ down box with keyword names used in this digi@@ ti@@ sing session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can restrict the number of ways to search for a keyword quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you typ@@ ed a number of keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field .
if several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is applied only to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word Filter section .
the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and search views . if one or more keyword filters are used from the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and disc@@ ard keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and place it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is set to no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or its , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set an Advanced search across all the elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group group . the options then look as follows :
why have Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly edited it &amp; edited it ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why one uses a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner can have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to push for the results they want . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows .
if your image workflow matches all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
their only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another colour space and make thoughts about color blu@@ r ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB &apos;s limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular area .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces .
do I have to monitor my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to monitor your monitor because s@@ RGB means that your monitor is s@@ RGB . if you work as s@@ RGB colour space , you either need to install your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve one image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting more manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , offset , Automatic calibration and contrast extend from the menu Con@@ duc@@ ting Automatic Cor@@ rection try automatically out of your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aling the brightness values across the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ ghtest point will be as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
compar@@ isons : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance re@@ actor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity canal becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the same results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balance : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary @-@ tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
enhance contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ us@@ ading of all values in between . this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because you have a color space with 8 @-@ bit color . if you are too far away from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can do the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry Col@@ ors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left , you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool settings . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window .
the target image preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right you see a hist@@ ogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment allows you to improve or down shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the pres@@ et list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and Up@@ loading make this exactly . any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original image . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high quality images . this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be done through the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in chapter Colour Management .
this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool color effects provides you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when one made a partially developed print a short flash@@ light and then the development of the picture completed . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination .
the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment creates a negative image , so that it is not possible to produce photographic paper .
this is an example of the Solar@@ is@@ ation Eff@@ ect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors bril@@ li@@ antly and g@@ lowing . just try it , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrasting edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large pictures the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and therefore it is not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you are applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one to great satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the results you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tools gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ k@@ thickness / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma , the tool clay @-@ value correction is used to improve exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated , you need only the area of the slider to explain this application . more concrete the three slide valves below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into them and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the controller and take care of how the picture changes .
on the right @-@ hand side , the original and thumb@@ nail preview can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to set the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in previ@@ ew@@ ing the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values as inter@@ actively as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create an extended image as a background while something else is seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
when using this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , media and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input of the Hist@@ o@@ grams for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to find exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result .
below you see an example of adjusting the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this box allows to specify the channel to be changed from the module :
beside this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a c@@ rank to the right , e.g. the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels disappear .
when you move this marker to the range you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve that you generated can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p c@@ rank format .
when you create this method and the three Color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the verti@@ ces of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves .
the over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to display over exposed pixels . if detected in more than one channel , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance Channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channel by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with one &apos;s own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram will display the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are right below : control for red , green and construction permit you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness as well , since the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the color space . the colour space consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
save as and load buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender settings can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to find exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the lumin@@ ance option is activated . the original picture can be seen in ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as colour pictures can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so similar to 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic ascen@@ sion effects and can simulate Moon Light scenes at day@@ time . so similar to 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow l@@ enti@@ l filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the re@@ development in a se@@ pi@@ ate . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ cam ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool frame add can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your picture . the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , rounded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio before using .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple , format@@ ted text into an image at any location , even if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text orientation , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool sten@@ cil Apply you can place a template on a picture .
the Image sten@@ cil template can be used in image processing to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your sten@@ cil template , simply send an e @-@ mail in English to which &amp; digi@@ kam ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button root folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the templates . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder will automatically update the template &apos;s preview bar .
the preview contains three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button res@@ ets the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must decrease the image accordingly .
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the picture lying under the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
blu@@ r mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by copyright by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the digital@@ isation process colours with minimal differences to one color dot . this in turn results in a slight blu@@ r . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually need more after sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , a camera has often been used for internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners use a follow @-@ up filter while reading the image . if you de@@ activate this , you get control over your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness of the focus . you can call this with the menu entry Cor@@ corrected sharpen@@ ing .
but you should handle this with caution because the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image sharp@@ ens the tool . under re@@ focusing , you find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little sof@@ tly is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ ble plas@@ tici@@ zing and experiment with some settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount enhances the effect . if you make the blu@@ r mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates are caused near sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ urred image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference @-@ amount . thus , you can define a minimal difference with it for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the shar@@ per and therefore f@@ law errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blu@@ r mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . fu@@ zzy mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright protected de@@ f@@ eit detection algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing quot ; in which it revers@@ es the focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna Fil@@ tr@@ ation . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blu@@ r mask . re@@ focus mostly results in better results than calling colors re@@ focusing in image processing .
the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical results also from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . the FI@@ R Viennese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is sometimes very strongly influenced by the distant pixels , causing unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . this is most often caused by a previously executed blu@@ r filter . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you have chosen large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations modifications that are not visible immediately , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by using the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . in practice , the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blu@@ r mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the focus correc@@ tions methods in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slider &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area of the dark@@ ened area in order to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the colour ink allows for a modified paint for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en , France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to uniform smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas greater values predomin@@ ate mainly homo@@ geneous regions and details are sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is required afterwards .
directional depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD @-@ r@@ ushing will create a high value und@@ ulating pattern . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is enough .
angular step width here &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . therefore , you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation Use : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal . it doubles the running time . therefore , we recommend it to let it out .
the buttons Save as and Up@@ loading make this exactly . any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time to load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button .
the module is used in a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera . as you can see , there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny r@@ ushing that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
radius monitors the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can blu@@ r the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus smaller errors are cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value defines the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong you can &apos;t remove all the noise or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the max@@ im , if you want to remove a weak r@@ ushing or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ em@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically stronger .
this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations in lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it is too high . if it is on its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may occur at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all noise reduction parameters that you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the image sof@@ tly is much easier than to shar@@ pen a picture . use tool for sof@@ tening the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ ble plas@@ tici@@ zing and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ul@@ arity , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
to reduce JPEG &apos;s arti@@ facts : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss@@ less compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ acts ; - small standards that are seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and Up@@ loading make this exactly . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time to load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie gra@@ ding on the faces .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo that was read by a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original image is under ( 1 ) to be seen and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ PI@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; to remove on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the Dark Picture button . the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels . these will be highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you pick up the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels .
the image area and preview help you correct the result inside the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings . poor pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
cut : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been magni@@ fied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo formats , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range evenly . instead , &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) it the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters need one factor 1,5 or 2 for aper@@ ture filters , which may cause the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also use a center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blu@@ r effects are caused by movement .
with the wide exposure range of today &apos;s filtration and gra@@ y@@ scale depth of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a shell image without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction addresses the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , corresponding to an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it to compensate for a small degree .
brightness , contrast , and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ ette correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm from David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distortion . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second graph covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can almost be eliminated .
general : this value controls the thickness of the second degree distortion . with negative values , barrel @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
verti@@ ces : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree . this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter &apos; has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size , resulting in a correction of first degree . negative values increase while positive the image decreases .
ligh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog shows a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next start .
the ton@@ ing / kis@@ sing @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or res@@ izing changes . best perform this correction as the first one . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ne @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent in the wrong direction .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important location , such as the sea rim or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ nen@@ - / kis@@ sen@@ sing distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Trans@@ form Transform@@ ers Cut off the image processing or using the zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ n@@ ular correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) to be seen .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film , you can preview two parameters . if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film , the ISO controller changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) to see . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top @-@ lights .
the digi@@ cam ; filter film gran@@ ul@@ ator is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film gran@@ ul@@ arity on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix large silver gran@@ ules of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image acqu@@ ires a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural images and still life styles are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better for large images . smoo@@ thing checks the smoo@@ thing or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel wide image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ th@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ cam ; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ cam ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wavel@@ i@@ ths 1 , the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blu@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ pes the image along star @-@ shaped lines from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blu@@ r : wi@@ pes the image by turning the pixels around the center . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a rotating camera .
distance blu@@ r : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
movement : bl@@ urred vision by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera .
sof@@ tening : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amor@@ ous photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urred vision by random shifting of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blu@@ r : finds the paint tank in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen on your picture . thus , it gives natural your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
drop size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drop on the picture .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image processing to keep an area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can get it by mirr@@ oring or spinning in the right direction . you can find the tools in the Trans@@ forming turning or transforming mirrors .
photo @-@ blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re @-@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . to do so , change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool for blowing .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo recovery was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE Team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the original image aspect ratio will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and Up@@ load are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ amping for photo can be stored as a text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time to pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by magni@@ fying a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you just need to use the mouse only to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut off . this will give you a good overview of how your photo after cutting would look like . you can change the size of the area to be cli@@ pped by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply clicking with the left mouse button .
when you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or save file under the menu file to save the newly @-@ cut photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog stays intact .
in the tool After aspect ratio cut , you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the higher value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
the tool After aspect ratio cut uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
when you use the mapping tool the next time , these settings are displayed as standard values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the sett@@ ling help settings allow you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are :
harmonious triangle : harmonious divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in similarly harmonious tri@@ angles aligned on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division of different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides more liquid relief lines if you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
in comparison to the third rule , the golden spiral generates a fluid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition introduces the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow along the line .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spir@@ als , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that draws the eye to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the gold spir@@ als discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the centre points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to place these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve in any other way .
the horizontal mirror options and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic variations .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle .
if you make a photo , it happens easily that you don &apos;t hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slider are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right top .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have shot a picture you will find un@@ desired tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ate cutting from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the Automati@@ cally cut function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after turning . note however the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you have to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle to the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is gre@@ ased a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with Transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing .
the sc@@ oring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformation sciss@@ ors .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can rotate horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press Pre@@ ferences , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the sea , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the sc@@ oring tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ oring , the image is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sh@@ utter@@ ing is twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sc@@ oring , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with a transformation from image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF among them .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; shows only files in formats that are familiar with . this happens based on the file extension and a comparison of these with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; edited ; the file in the editing pane can be changed .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you even to choose the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; edited ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images . thereby , redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF using the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ . in the Con@@ figuration section you can find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is included in &amp; digi@@ .@@ This is supported by more than 200 raw file formats . all support cameras can be seen at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ .@@ This is supported by :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; edited ; but is not a film editing software and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; edited ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start the program for playback .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ .@@ Your description will follow here .
use a single dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialogue :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divi@@ ders . the upper area shows the original and the lower one for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it in the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the Properties page shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originate from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can move in or zoom out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it . push it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this of course assumes that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the Di@@ alogue palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or search the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is displayed in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the palette view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is enabled Bei@@ m cur@@ sor under the button Add color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ rides another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions to copy , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if another color follows . if there are three numerical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of color sel@@ ections can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the colour selection on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . up to now there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs included &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; Project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ;

loading of large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
other required software : &amp; k@@ graphics viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for displaying graphs . needed in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . at the beginning , if you &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without launching an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; -@@ files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; you can also remember your decision so that later also procedure will be used . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item settings k@@ graphi@@ cally ; set up ... use , see also .
if you open a Graph@@ ite file outside a running &amp; k@@ graph@@ eme ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ olo@@ gem _ instance or display the graphs to be loaded in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards .
when starting the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one page will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled in by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with a one @-@ page graph without head@@ line and another font
the Renew@@ able Download page gives you the ability to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the current session ) or determine that each time is asked .
the session management page gives you the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not to the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which appears normally by clicking in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directed graphs . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ apping as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the default for un@@ readable graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for un@@ developed graphs . it uses the fruity @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des in a circular way according to the description of Six and Tol@@ li , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms to change special options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( judged or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type to ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ readable graphs ) .
if this setting is checked , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the San@@ e Project or any other source like Video Stre@@ ams . for this to work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ he to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the button scan . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
make sure that the window will be displayed in full , as some settings may not be displayed .
after you have pressed the scan button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected the menu import &gt; screen shot ... a window appears where you can adjust the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ des :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse will be read .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog box appears with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send your photos to the people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , make photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you are guided by the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . it is thus practically your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can log in to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful application , the module can send pictures to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful application .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . to upload , you need write per@@ missions .
the button photos should be pushed once after you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press on the O@@ k button the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the Tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as key during the upload .
with the options Op@@ ens , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie , you can set the access rights to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose the option Change the size of the photos before upload , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . size is taken from the value registered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export currently has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing them , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image , and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization makes tools available to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical location Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . in order to run a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file .
when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera time zone here .
the setting for the maximum time vari@@ ance is an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation is below this , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from a place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relating to inter@@ pol@@ ation .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog changes the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the indicated map . to do so , select the region and enlarge it . enter this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will be coded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the albums are not displayed hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the Ap@@ pear@@ ance tab defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the picture will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the Reiter record defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . to do this , select a folder where you have write per@@ missions . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with Other Color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the Ri@@ der preview images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for the thumb@@ nails which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred while generating . the web browser will automatically start to close the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and swit@@ chers . he was developed for quick picture display and quick access to his functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss@@ less storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of color information takes place . this can be found in the P@@ NG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client module is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then , select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after you have pressed the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write into any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please refer to ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG code@@ c module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG code@@ c module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a base image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Sli@@ deshow . then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high , very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . the name and path of the generated file can be specified under the name of the m@@ peg output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as far as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the button ko@@ de . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a hint appears that coding or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings on the bottom right below .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. : useful to improve or print the Gim@@ p module directly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on Dave Coff@@ in command @-@ line tool . an original quote from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file which is to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal you can further edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch doesn &apos;t have any effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere , you should not select the JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion with the trigger button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at a time . use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the option to automatically over@@ write existing file . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image . in addition , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images with a file selection dialog using the button Add images . for the last selected image , you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag images to the list of images to add them to the list of images to be sent .
the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images you can open the New Message window of your e @-@ mail client by clicking OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . their configuration is stored and used every time you change them .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and enclosed by the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under images file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the sending images .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end .
after starting the Advanced Sli@@ deshow a window will appear with questions about how to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL transitions option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file name option shows that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option pictures random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . thus , it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
between the pictures the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should check this out before presenting your friends !
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select . by chance , each transition from the images chooses a different effect .
during the slide show you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left corner of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on you .
with this tool@@ bar you can pause and restart the presentation , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .

the Back@@ ground K@@ IP@@ I module is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE working surface .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with notes , you can go with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , you are now in any group , so in persons , places and in the group keywords are present .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information than you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and , of course , view the current preview images .
when you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images are shown on which both persons are visible . by this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images in your area of action .
in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of her name . you can store with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album , but for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to display images next to the name , select the button located on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you have to specify which image to be displayed for each individual . in order to do this , you will need to open the image view window ( in more detail ) and in the context menu , you will have to select the image for the appropriate person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
if you call the Search entry in the main window , a dialog will be displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for creating the image properties . you can view this dialog once again .
if you enter a string in the field cap@@ tion or description , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also specify a date to search for ; the date may be either part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use an area of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can browse all images according to specific names , as you can see in the picture . here the pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene , are depicted .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ Album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album .
if you prefer to print out this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; as a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you data statistics on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can change between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of that date will be displayed in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ eline . if you select an area , you will see only images of this time period in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual the in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album is described ; integrated version described which you can create from the menu file HTML ...
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and purpose . in the following , each section is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ Photo@@ Album ; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select if a &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album is to be created ; -@@ Ex@@ ports file should be created on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . by doing so you can avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are displayed by a party .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this page is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . therefore , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , do not download images that have , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have set . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
for all your HTML files , select a base folder and a new sub@@ folder for each successive set .
first you have to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . you can choose either a folder or a K@@ DE protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they really are all visible to the viewer . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be started after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will run in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you will have to copy them there manually . so that the import function , see , properly works , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; together , you might want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have spent a lot of time looking at the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; do not do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , both internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are saved in the file , or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that this file can be shared so independently . however , the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see Cre@@ ate . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches for the images that are located in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described which you can access via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the Automati@@ cally copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; the images are automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Export ... then &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant to im@@ porting is made up of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you are the category Person@@ s of the file to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories they are in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the image .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at images , you often want to jump inside different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your holiday in Italy and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting the information about your images , over ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top of its images . this is a simple XML file that lets you back up with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; mem@@ ori@@ ze the folder in which your images are stored and use it in future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album , you can launch a new folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ Photo@@ Album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings c@@ Photo@@ Album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; in the following section of the user manual the different settings are explained .
on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and one click on the desired option .
it has been described to you how to set different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; share its modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ cam and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . please refer to the website of Ki@@ pi for more information .
the modules can be called through the menu module . the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; however , most of the modules have a help page that you can access through the module itself .
since the modules are used together by multiple applications together , it can be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; only very little tested . therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures .
the applications which use the modules above K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album are not working . this is the disadvantage when you share features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; and other applications that K@@ IP@@ I also use is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album .
it simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the preview right now .
next to the current album , you have to pass a photo album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module .
or it will use the category that you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album is used ; so do so , so if you would have chosen people to view it and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu bar and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar , you will see the window that you can browse your image database .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; is the ability to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons appearing on the image , where the image has been taken , etc . you can set any picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , is illustrated on all pictures Jes@@ per and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by setting persons , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are depicted , you can find that the names used are shifted upward , the persons find and assign more quickly .
if you prefer to display an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting icon by date under the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and ann@@ ot@@ ate these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple items at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the Com@@ ment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the ann@@ ot@@ ation dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from within a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... button , which offers among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select the entry of images in your browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nail images of the currently selected images , or all images if you have no filter set . you can see the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
if you click on a picture , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the delete button or select Edit menu in the Edit menu . now the window will appear you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can also use the images anywhere , so that &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can record the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can record the view of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; if not all necessary images can be downloaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated are not stored on the hard drive . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , the thumb@@ nails are available , so that &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; you can view these images not with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy and copy files from the folders . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; does not yet support you to insert the related CD . so , if you want to avoid trouble on how to avoid mixing your images , please buy a larger disk to store all the images on it .
in the Pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , you filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you un@@ available and click on Current View from the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also use all the images that your little sister may see , control and select the menu entry Every@@ thing except current view .
with this you have set which images to be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images to be hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change password in the privacy menu .
for one , all images on the hard disk and on the other hand , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection only serves those who are with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view of private images .
the reason you have all your pictures with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to view them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album is equipped with a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in it . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter over the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and place somewhere else . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information should be displayed . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . you can see the pop @-@ up context menu below .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and after by using the image height and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how frequently it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can drag and zoom into the image . for zo@@ oming , you can pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus button , you can zoom out The Plus key zo@@ oming in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the dot button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the power button , you set the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus power button .
with the turning functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make comments to the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture . in the moment you can view this and open configuration dialog of the image to enter those names . you may prefer to select only the image and look at more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this picture , you can see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply put them all at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview . if you want to view categories in dre Vor@@ h@@ view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show in a picture . in this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later .
in order to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album ; switch on the painting from the context menu . to stop the painting , just press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; you need to use the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully master , but documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have read and understood .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the sub @-@ object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will appear so that you can choose the right position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under editing , or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply this Chan@@ ges . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on the user or disc@@ ard the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the tag view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross in the wire model view displays . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of view of the higher @-@ level object or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected , or their visibility level is smaller , or equal to the level of visibility that is selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window layout as default . the object tree and the view of object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or under a current view , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the index tab at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the tool@@ bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the tool@@ bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place .
you can save the current window view with view window layout ... save . a dialog will be displayed in which you can store the window layout under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon . the Ren@@ dering symbol in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry View scene .
render mode matches the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview up to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to use a name that indicates the properties of the mode .
in the cart@@ on card size you can enter the width and height of the row@@ ed image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in the quality combination field , you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection light .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , several errors can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the display . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the impact of this error . in general , pictures with this feature look better .
if you turn on Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing , calculate and connect to Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tively because the super @-@ sampling is the neighbouring pixels with inputs . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because every pixel is distributed again and again because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels is exceeded , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
if you are using abs ( b 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further tra@@ cked and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process , called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays hit no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; likewise .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the Property View , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. altitude field data ) in the paths to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ Li@@ br@@ aries . if you include files that are not in the folder , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the sphere , you can adjust the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross High Detailed View for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you cross wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you cross the ground , a bottom is rendered under the objects . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick the edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . please refer to the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section for more details .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window instructions section will explain how to create and store window arrangements .
the drop down box standard window layout : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window order when starting the program .
the list of window orders displays all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected order with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the selected window layout . you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a card view view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules can be used for rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you get only one black image .
if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pres@@ et window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tool@@ bar icons . please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item Edit . thus , you now have a scene without objects .
the clin@@ cher view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right bottom ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
when you press the user button or the input button , the wi@@ re@@ model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they view the scene from the view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a fa@@ der ( insert infinite body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the user button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the clin@@ cher view now also shows the level , albeit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite end . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree closely , you will find that you can open the item for the floor when you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows :
first select the ground to adjust its properties . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . please select first sub@@ item . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pigment preview only shows a matt black material , because you still have to enter the pigment settings . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the box and bul@@ let in the preview , just click on the user button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you have expected . in the color list , you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the object tree select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mon@@ ochro@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should be able to execute this step already , as you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already understood , the ball can be created just as simple as the floor :
in the object properties view , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or the user button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you have shifted the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already at the bottom , give the ball a pigment as color :
select the first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in bul@@ let pigment . click on bul@@ let pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the input button .
the settings shine effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome @-@ plated surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the rac@@ er shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , each scene needs to be rendered , some sources of light and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously made with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last modified command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have previously used edi@@ ts .
saves the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new configuration or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option to modify or add new short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; changes or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . with this option you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands .
a B@@ ump Map is a way to simulate rugged surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a B@@ ump Map and a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking on the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the return button .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing En@@ ter or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Di@@ alogue Classi@@ fication - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , general and editing and slide show , you can set the working of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected then the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , load &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay , if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background will also be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up to show only some of the file types that the program can display .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
determines whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
change here the short@@ cuts for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
shows large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduced the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is opened .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ picture ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ cam ; image editing . &amp; show@@ picture ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; project .
&amp; show@@ picture ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and make correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is a show photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his share , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show photo ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu provides a message with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ picture ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show photo ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show photo ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to take part in the show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show photo ; .
&amp; show@@ picture ; try to give you so much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options that can change the behavior of the show photo ; to access these settings , you need to set up in the menu settings show@@ picture ; set up . the preferences dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side .
in the exposure indicators area , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you are supposed to display . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and exposure to a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ picture ; features a side@@ bar at the right edge giving you important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in image processing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; h@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer make images and save images .
&amp; h@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images . &amp; h@@ ul@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the information you need on this website : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line by &amp; h@@ l@@ ite ; with the command h@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; h@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options particularly .
in order to scan an image , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . he can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits in the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you have selected a preview in the settings before saving , then the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and lie ? s leads to an abor@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sc@@ ur@@ ite ; images can be selected . dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if &amp; h@@ l@@ ite ; it will automatically save with a generated name in a pre @-@ defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically stored image receives a num@@ eric suff@@ ix , which each time is uploaded , when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to store . this value also changes compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected then the default value of Q@@ t will be used .
the button About starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialog for &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; h@@ l@@ ite ;

&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below , you can set up a list of short@@ cuts and their function . you can set up the global keyboard short@@ cut by clicking the right mouse button in the Player window and clicking on Global Keyboard short@@ cuts .
you can set up existing multimedia keys to function as &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; short commands . this will make your keyboard to &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , most of which are also found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function pause could look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Amar@@ ok has some of its own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog to ensure that the user knows why a script does not work .
begin require &apos; rescue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this purpose strings will be written to the default script of the script . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script needs to take care of each script itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok places the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , more information about the new item ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also passed to allow the script to use d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform tasks such as storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks Script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is finished , you can app@@ end it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script side of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the am@@ aro@@ k script ; scripts .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can easily drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title from thousands of items in your collection . with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . these and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the configure time point with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . see the system requirements section for details .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in developing &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you should use full .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you can set up the setup dialog without any trouble . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed ( Ju@@ K ) .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option switches off the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
create atmospheric shapes : this function is only available when &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . thus , the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed .
set mood files in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder by &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ le / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; should be started when a browser is needed .
other browsers use : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
to save playlist when you exit , the current playlist will automatically save when you exit &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the playlist at the end of the playlist .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , then &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep the current piece visible while changing the piece , the playlist will pop up / roll in order to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area .
changing the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s Ap@@ pear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section , you can set the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; by selecting own fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray displayed section will be enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows , and context browsers . click Select ... so you can select a font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of user defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector activated below for foreground and background color .
playback during start causes that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; after program start , playback automatically continues with the piece at the place with which it was stopped at the last exit .
set up the On @-@ Screen display window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if On @-@ Screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color sel@@ ections . if O@@ SD colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors are used .
the Display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers still activate more settings in this map .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; Browse these as well as their sub@@ folders to music .
monitoring changes : allows &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor selected folders for changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : cause &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the drop down driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further installation in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is required .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device is used to set up the database for &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; under Calcul@@ ator : specify the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name for which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if necessary .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
calling similar interpre@@ ters : after activation of this setting , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; a list with similar performers will be retri@@ eved to the played piece . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . so you have to install k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs included , because &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; requires some of them to e.g. find modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager will hold the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time , it is because Tag@@ lib crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable it if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or at least do not use value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email will automatically open for a crash ) . if it is a common crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a information , but do not mark them as uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( shu@@ ffle mode / repe@@ ating / dynamic playlist ) look always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will simply be forgotten . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows their effect .
if you get this error : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are some options . most installation problems are ligh@@ test by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please insert a bug there if you have something to fix a fault in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; only an empty playlist will appear . how do pieces of music come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the GUI intuitive , the start window has been converted into the Statistics window . you &apos;ll find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to review pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column view rating . click somewhere in the new application column to determine the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From the drop @-@ down menu from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist with the mouse to the playlist and drop it there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the addition button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click on it .
you probably lack the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for lib@@ ary , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . you can also find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
none ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be which media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any conceivable audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in the default no MP3 Decoder is included ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa heat@@ sink , the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously distribute audio . this can be achieved by using a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different hint ( e.g. sho@@ cking ) .
you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just want to hear a white noise . Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure the wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x issues problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . magni@@ fying the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was heavily optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ ad the visu@@ aliz@@ ations react . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , it crashes and am@@ aro@@ k . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you will need to register all the components . follow the register register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Store til@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then , run m@@ peg @-@ register , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module file ( you will find the module folder with the following @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute the following registry again . start now &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
if you have a full list of suggestions , please send it to our mailing list : amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p am@@ aro@@ k player play
this command lets &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have awak@@ ened from the soft tones of music that you have stopped before bed@@ time .
how to know the current title in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , if you are on a different computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ts and titles of the current piece : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usability am@@ aro@@ k player now@@ playing
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ windows . pressing d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + Right mouse button puts a piece in the queue in the queue . pressing the input button after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but what does the symbol in the system section of the control bar look like ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead .

basically , this adju@@ sts the previous evaluation with a decreasing value , based on how often the play was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by right @-@ clicking on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the rating of a piece just like all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the item and editing : select the rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the dialog metadata .
the developers do not want you to provide you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not able to bring up Amar@@ ok &apos;s scheduled plan .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . des@@ elect the option icon while playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select settings tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click on New Design ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .

if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore also a lot of bug reports .
probably , &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you must configure &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re @-@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; re @-@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably have to use a distribution that has installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ compile and install again .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip of mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module has to be installed next to the Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module .
you get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer -@@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
set up settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output you enter the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
if you would like to have a plug @-@ sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and output will be performed on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of converting the sampling rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check@@ box at sound card to support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not further supported . you can naturally take this problem yourself into your hands ! if you want , you can become the new so much @-@ needed car@@ et@@ aker for arts : )
listen to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there &apos;s the setup wizard that will be displayed on the first start of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; if you want to upgrade your collection later , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will be a help . with your help you will have &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in just a few minutes .

the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the Player window . once you mark the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist from &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many functions that it does not exist in any other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the Play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context @-@ browser displays various information regarding the current piece . its look can be adjusted using context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpre@@ ts . these three sub@@ windows are explained later in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k , you might notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there now has been distributed to other parts of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . in addition , the information can be collected in the Statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover @-@ picture of the album and beside it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to look up the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find further information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in context @-@ browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context @-@ browser will also display cover images that have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played right away .
among the selected pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current performer .
you can set which information to view in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . when you click on an album , it will be worked out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using the help of self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try and am@@ aro@@ k ; to download the text for the piece from the internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version is then stored in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s collection database .
the Search button opens a search for goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First of all the pieces are arranged according to the performer , and a further distribution is performed according to the respective album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent performers .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the artist is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted according to the album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing as you wish .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this could take a while .
there is a search filter right under the tool@@ bar . it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view .
under the search filter there is a drop @-@ down box , with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you have various time windows at your disposal , ranging from the last 24 hours to a year .
by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options .
load - This will empty the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid playlist .
app@@ end to play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry , you reach the same effect .
set pieces in a queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will make you play next .

burn all pieces of this performer / burn to CD - This will allow the selected pieces to be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned to either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move Files to M@@ ül@@ ten@@ mer ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it will appear among different interpre@@ ters .
highlight the compilation selection - Modi@@ fy a selected album back into a normal album . the album will then no longer be shown in different interpre@@ ters , but will be shown again under the corresponding interpreter .
the Play@@ list browser makes handling of many play@@ lists quite easy . among other things , it also contains smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist includes the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection , which have never been played .
even created Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists are possible . just click Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub @-@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to use your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; to use , for example your iPod with &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title out of the playlist and drop it to the list Interpre@@ t . if you are done , click Apply . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transmission is complete , stop &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar there is a search field that you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar that lets you pick up music from a entered URL . for example , if you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop it .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of the Shift key can be difficult . in this case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : thereby dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply typing the entries with the mouse to the desired place . once you enter letters there is a text box where you can enter a filter . as soon as you enter letters there are only the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back@@ button until the text box is empty again .
if you enter by whit@@ esp@@ ace separate search terms , then &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; searching for entries containing all search terms . if you enter , for example , one two three , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you type OR between the search terms OR , it is searched for entries which contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR 2 OR 3 . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries by Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for bigger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something search for pieces that do not contain anything .
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 @-@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment pool .
you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order to the entries . the entries then receive a lab@@ eling with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist .
next , you can rever@@ t or restore the buttons , so you can rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist .
in the center of the tool@@ bar is a unique , magni@@ fic@@ ant analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you get in the player window over the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . you can set the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars ... select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all the pieces . also , the status for shu@@ ffle mode and retri@@ eval is displayed , a slider for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . through this menu , you can reach &amp; am@@ aro@@ k .
a click on this entry will open the window visualization plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k .
this entry contains a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; .
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover @-@ management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left @-@ hand side .
with the View menu , you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover management . select :
the queue management got your big move in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , a number appears in the playlist next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .

double click on the desired playlist , drag them to the play@@ lists window or right @-@ click on you and then select download . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one .
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di random mix and play@@ lists immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces will start with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next turn , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button cle@@ ars the current playlist and adds new pieces accordingly to the dynamic mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit Play@@ list opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .

played pieces - this is the number of pieces to be played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog , you can select from pre @-@ existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists .
some scripts make your own settings possible . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then clicking on it .

the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org , where you get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback from the forums and get news .
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a flow ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; sel@@ ects and k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; to burn CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio coding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported .
L@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them onto an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ Ma@@ ger : a fully featured author system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are played differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save as shown , with which you can choose folders and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and making changes . besides , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what is to happen , just as if you have called for each project file closing .
includes all opened projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , you will be asked what to do with it as if you have called a file close .
when you visit this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you draw the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added in the base folder of the CD will appear .
this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Bur@@ n , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described using the What &apos;s the ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session merge into the current project . this is useful when you want to merge files for a multi @-@ session CD .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create one image from a CD , which you can then burn later . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this also allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create one image from a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copy dialog is not supported yet , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will delete the contents completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialogue asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which can then immediately be burned by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialogue asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used in stand@@ alone mode . it contains information about the read output , encoding settings and even ways to modify the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; when an entry is selected , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media Info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the table of contents allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the table of contents is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header line is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header panel has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key signature assignment below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . thus , the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs may be set . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and to fine @-@ adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line , or use the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is more important than the one of the programs you prefer .
in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following on the console :
besides general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b features features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void BAE D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bour@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bour@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void \ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ String name ) void \ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void addle Ur@@ l ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void _ wa@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test@@ ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard drive ) and by many coding machines that en@@ code these WAV files . currently , l@@ ame is supported for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) . more codes can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format , or in other formats , such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ able ( for O@@ GG ) or other en@@ co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , but it is not necessary to install only the packages that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction to co@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device protecting the protection , it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up has to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration was found ) , then the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained to the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; obtain information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step for example , there are more information on how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
CD@@ DB request of the CD data will start on request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - when an en@@ coder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup catalog - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the default . note that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as logs , be@@ eps ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) .
opens the main entry dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , en@@ coder and compression rates and helps you choose the right coding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
under the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences are less important , as both codes generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless included with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but slightly lower quality compared to O@@ GG for lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG voting machines is available .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good visibility for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / need with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the en@@ coder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ co@@ ders will explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add CD ; title to the keywords ( English : tag ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t from l@@ ame and the title Paramet@@ ers of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator must be added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information instead of entering the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : this is meant by the author ) is not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the CD ; any information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; and in addition , the information without the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is actively to choose a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only updates to the database .
what reading program is used to store pieces from CD &amp; CD ; to store in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened .
for the first time , pre @-@ defined l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added to the encoding menu . other codes can be added to this tab .
the en@@ coder package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for pre @-@ defined codes . more information about en@@ coder can be found in the Ko@@ di@@ erer chapter .
after installing a coding , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and write real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc . ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; please check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are still unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( Tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write privileges on it ( eg by trying to copy it into it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what kind of reading &amp; CD is to be repeated .
here we determine the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any reading of a &amp; CD ; once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , then a look into the / etc / f@@ stab file and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information , select promp@@ ts so that you will be informed if information on generating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the Cart@@ ridge CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the machine must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop down box is easier , is a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; renamed and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
you can use fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database previously . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this path the load is distributed between the machines , but this setting will work first .
both work equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls are standard@@ ly bo@@ ck@@ down the protocol 88@@ 80 , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box .
simply take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously missing pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try it yourself .
disc@@ ard CD ; after reading out the last piece , tick this to the CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then the path / folder can be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
just enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is somewhat long , you may need to scroll to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in the event of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously en@@ co@@ operating WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
this is it , we just have the basic device of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have wis@@ ely chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will set up and set up MP3 files . first , a connection to the internet is structured as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will want to pick up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
since we use one &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from the data obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually input data instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example will be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , then the CD has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then check the section Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers after the Help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the fre@@ ed@@ b could be picked up , all titles of the pieces have been filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window visible and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you did not select the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the input field &apos; Lat@@ est Tit@@ le &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments in person / piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful call of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but contains already the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ desirable comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment range . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all en@@ co@@ ders or file formats . see Help coding to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the missing CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under rock .
after selecting &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the row with the second piece .
the CD Editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
caution : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the piece list .
note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line will turn off the selection of the piece , or select the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once .
if the selection process has been selected by clicking on the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
on the tab jobs for switching to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the lower left part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error message when you try to work with a code that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and destination folders are not what we typ@@ ed here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into MP3 format . this allows reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . the computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to be a problem for simultaneous reading and encoding ( of two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is in the queue of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is en@@ coded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to produce compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the coding of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; will be able to maintain CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . however , most distri@@ butions contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adjusted to your needs once it &apos;s running , then the following is right for you :
a program that inv@@ okes many different programs has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different index cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hi , still on reading ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any c@@ lue as to proceed from this somehow blank screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? if you read this , you probably have already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t maintain this manual . it &apos;s the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or change something useful may do it . and if you read this , he has left this section and agrees with this proposal .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others , he has also features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to move to mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) .
session support . if you want to quit while playing a song , k@@ mid starts again with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will start automatically once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once you start playing a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ Ad and change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , pressing the space bar like printing on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry break in the menu item , interrup@@ ts the playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics of lyrics and others use both . some pieces have no lyrics at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined which uses a song , so you don &apos;t have to adjust anything manually . so if you select the Automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke text will automatically be selected , but you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select the entries in the menu settings and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can consoli@@ date . in this section , you will see how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the collection under the item Organ@@ izing .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then displaying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the ad in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . consider this when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . it appears again the file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection .
when Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add @-@ on to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . then this collection will be added to the un@@ opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu selection sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the Previous Model button , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the key arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not general MIDI . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI response transl@@ ates into events syn@@ thes@@ ized by the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play .
if you only have one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the necessary settings for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , it is necessary that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) .
Def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; En@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; A further key map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that a section is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid , I can offer support for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
in this section you will see how the patches from General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the sign sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you must not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all the sounds that this instrument need to sound with the number M . if your keyboard , for example , does not support a gun fire ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( ri@@ fle shooting ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch , in which each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always identical drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how tones are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as its presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key maps are used mainly to map tones on the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look as an example of the included key maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to replace the first and second channel , simply use the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the N channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key map will be used with the name name for this channel . of course , if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all the events that try to change the patch on this channel will be ignored . in this case , patch x is always used .
for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch may be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates which ratio of pitch @-@ nam@@ ing events is multip@@ lied . if a pitch @-@ nam@@ ing event is sent with the value n , it will be converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed only . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that there are no decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der Event is supposed to play a pitch with the value 40@@ 96 , a tone higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards are trying to get two sounds up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , It@@ em MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not turn green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the channel View menu : settings
the tempo LCD displays the speed when a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer get a similar sound quality .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all the files individually .
this is why it supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows .
first of all , activate the Automati@@ cally Add to Collection setting . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have open a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or go ( if I play a MIDI file ) or go back ( when I play a kar@@ aoke file ) , I just have to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn off the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ S@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so , set the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection and open A.@@ Ther@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play with B.@@ M@@ ID and C@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ elop@@ is@@ .@@ es
they make me really happy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MI@@ DI@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will include among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me since I might have the file .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money from anyone . I would like to stress that I &apos;m only getting more programmed because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch for AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also goes to Jose Luis L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , Mr. Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ tin , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive e @-@ mail .
and of course , thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this can be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing@@ lists or send an error message right to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ de ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help , please check the site The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . alternatively , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections from the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . when you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / folder can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ ered c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml ; the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ Cut ; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player . here , the path can be set by the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player . everything must be configured by editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file , just like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here &apos;s an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module is played :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even insert the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to allow the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
to always take a given back@@ end for a certain mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should play all the o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port should be used .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playback of video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be supported .
internally , different names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of creating this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ version , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , source l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ r@@ source . when enabled , they begin playing the playlist .
is there any hint how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is run as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be seen on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts up slowly , why does my CPU have to be tested for its performance every time ?
note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically takes the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling and til@@ ting .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . Unix @-@ like systems probably use the package &amp; ly@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the Linux / Linux distribution . the installation should include the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact about the Ki@@ le ; -@@ website should be made .
if you have any questions regarding the compilation of &amp; Ki@@ le , or if extensions are requested , it should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs .
to learn more about &amp; brands ; and to experience its possibilities should consult the manual for Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the correct language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a lay@@ man can also use a lay@@ man . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while there is only a good overview to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to master correctly , good books should be used e.g. H. cop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other drawing languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the general characteristics such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size are defined as well as a body with text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the quick entry assistant of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some options for creating the document . you can also apply some settings related to the document .
document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , project author &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom .
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for lat@@ ex ; for the integration you only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article ( DIN ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DIN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with the German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the creation of German texts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is merely a short description of the functions and further information about this will be given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; a simple problem search is possible ( example ) : if you see more complex areas of a large text on the screen , it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you will be spar@@ ed by the modest appearance of the output file .
when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le , an empty line ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) will be created when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows to divide the document into the following elements ( part is the most commonly and sub@@ paragraph ) :
when viewing the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files , the search query can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; file independent file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent file ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information like the font and is next to PDF the usual output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools to view , convert and to print from DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and devices .
when using a file search , the elements of the DVI ; file are used with the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; file was cli@@ cked , the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source text was cli@@ cked , the corresponding spot in DVI ; -@@ viewer was bo@@ unded .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
quick build : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no bugs in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is built on a number of sizes - and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction .
when looking at the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down box is for spe@@ edy integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ...
the Choice Field Fur@@ ther is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , no@@ des or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , an image or different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( select a select field possible ) .
with &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; works only if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files are necessary editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files can naturally also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box named Gr@@ Ã ¶ nig@@ ma is used for speci@@ fying the font size . the font sizes for the main text , the no@@ des , etc. can be defined . the following font sizes are available :
2 . the Wiz@@ ard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and docum@@ enting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from bottom to hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ Docum@@ ent contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font size . if the font size is not defined at the beginning , this can also happen later in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex needs to be compiled ; the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu building or the button fast construction .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling .
if the document comp@@ iling is out of place , it should be searched for errors in logging . if you use quick @-@ install it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns are supposed to have another font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow the change of font size within the environment allocated .
changes are enforced only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , you can add certain fon@@ ts , bold , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for offensive printing and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed itali@@ c in \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quota } and ends with \ \ end { quota } .
the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mark@@ up language is now followed by a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few modifications should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . for this , a quote , a few passages in bold and itali@@ c print and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , an editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try it and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed ( in the viewer ) using File Print ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the transformation of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the pre@@ text search allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this , only Modern can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools Building is selected .
in order to perform the pre@@ text search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on pre @-@ set search . the jump to the corresponding spot in DVI ; -@@ Viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and jumps to the corresponding line .
if there is no error in using a quick @-@ install of the &amp; DVI file , an error may be present . if an error is present , it can be sum@@ mar@@ ised in the log file or in the message window .
the log file tells the source code in the source code . in the editor , the buttons of the La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for spr@@ ints between the errors . the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears . in order to view the er@@ ron@@ eous line , it must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the wrong line .
once cli@@ cked on the respective button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file will be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template by File New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings General .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by typing in document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ Docum@@ ent &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps need to be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard settings .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created . if a simple way to create a template , it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; posters ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for and posters ; can be made directly from &amp; Ki@@ le .
to find out more &amp; posters ; and to experience its possibilities , consult Kate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference that can be called over the menu La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the Edi@@ ting Pan@@ e .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search for different kinds of source texts and emphasize them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color .
many Wiz@@ ards can include additional jump tok@@ ens . this is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu Edit boun@@ ce marks or the corresponding ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes enable the jump to the next or last jump mark .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; though &amp; posters ; already excellent possibilities offered , were added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; include special commands for their selection .
he@@ ats a complete paragraph ( group of lines which contain an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning closes with tables , and lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ itative thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines .
this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also has an extended meaning , as this command also has an extended meaning ( \ \ ) and an additional ast@@ er@@ isk ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , of course , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; Bs ; offers the keyboard root C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for a faster option .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit pick @-@ up paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under editing environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command will jump to the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to run the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to the location of the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is present before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient instructions , the overview can be lost quickly . this command completes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
when the cur@@ sor is present before or after the cur@@ ly clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted @-@ cur@@ ly groups @-@ brackets you can quickly lose overview of the above . this command completes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple reference marks are used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign is used for two simple reference marks . also for the end of the guidance the character is used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and provides two closing signs for lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic entry of double quotes can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be turned on and off .
you can also use specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when using Shift ; En@@ try button for a smart line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a spread@@ sheet environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjoining line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added to Settings Ki@@ le ; set up La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to obtain this . although this tab is unfortunately not the one added , &amp; Ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; posters ; already offers a good source code completion , it was added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . there are three different modes . all these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings Ki@@ le ... Complete settings .
at the beginning a new environment by command \ \ begin { surroundings } will &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when you click the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and it will be possible to enlarge the complete list . on the other hand , the list can also be smaller by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are naturally removed from the selection of a command . alternatively , from &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump @-@ marks can also be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible by editing features and the desired parameters .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . you can select different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands as well as wi@@ re@@ books of the general language use .
command mode is not useful for completing environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to enter . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environments .
when you enter the settings mode on the menu Edit settings area , or the Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the ambient commen@@ ce can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key to exit .
once this has been completed , the environment will be automatically closed again . once and Ki@@ le ; recognize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command will be executed .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of list mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supported user @-@ defined lists of cut@@ backs that can be replaced immediately by dra@@ gging strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Complete . as an example of a cooling list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word def@@ aults on the menu editing Complete recall or the keyboard root C@@ tr@@ l + Alt key , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large size recept@@ ac@@ les are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; Complete for all already written trades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can be set up in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ le Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu ... Complete file cas@@ ings . here , the threshold value can also be set for the display of complete compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the dialog graphic shapes the entry of graphics as simple as possible . in order to see the basics about graphics formats , the sections should be highlighted .
PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is enabled , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; -@@ tools can then be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
to view the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all the tools are group@@ ed in groups in the Cre@@ ating , Cre@@ ating and Cre@@ ating views .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI ; file can be viewed in a standard viewer by Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the quick @-@ build command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time .
a new project is being asked about the project New Project .... The following information is asked for the project :
when exec@@ uting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ e@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed by scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods has :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a well @-@ designed system in which basic functions can be extended by a multitude of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; ly@@ live ; are shipped with many documents , including a documentation for the packages contained and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
here it is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete user manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and is thus ideal for the search for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the finding of the correct document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; documents delivered and here a graphical surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the bigger advantage is the search for package names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer to the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source text editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; can also be executed on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the existence of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project and offer for many hours for the development of tools that we all can use in compliance with the &amp; GNU ; -@@ license .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for emails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface , you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
random signatures will make any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails more varied and unique .
for daily signatures the same signature is from &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day ; read out . for each day , use different signatures , as with random signatures , create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this will save you one ; empty signatures ; and add your new signature in the bottom section . signature @-@ example Kon@@ qi conver@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file save or click on the disk icon Save .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use email private or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red Cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar .

everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation is familiar with mein@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects an inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the sub@@ folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time mein@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already mentioned , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already has worked knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is there a great graphical interface for this now .
if the straight opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is found .
when it comes to a output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply checked . if not , delete it at the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - file selection .
if you only want to know if the well format@@ ted file is , click the Well @-@ Form@@ ed review selection .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; schema as well as for the Rel@@ ax review is the definition of the definitions @-@ UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , also has an &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file cho@@ oser file .
specify the name of the file as the result should have . normally , the file is stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , off@@ end , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality at once and don &apos;t have to wait until someone builds the set in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; -@@ elements .
to install a plugin or part , we start editing plug @-@ ins . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe every &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often , several individuals work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , supports the statement of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used to uniquely identify .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub@@ project manager .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze + button . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of your own identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something is going on . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later you can see how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will insert a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the side event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list , and the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how such conductors are set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
it can be selected either the comment entry from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by ann@@ ot@@ ext .
notes may be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with nick@@ name of the set top name of the team member , plays a role in the project : team leader sub @-@ project leaders should be given the corresponding area or sub @-@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around par@@ enth@@ eses and tags are invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up with settings Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog covers a number of pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , regarding tags including car completion can be changed with this . the entries are :
large / lower case of tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal / lower case letter means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower case of attributes : large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes . normal / lower case letter means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start and finish day automatically : when enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding while typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the Def@@ ault button , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in any other way than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . but this setting is checked from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized . however , this setting is checked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , periodi@@ cally creates backup copies , so that during a power failure or crash when the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or in a separate view ( or documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful if the user interface has been confused by changing M@@ DI modes and / or depen@@ dencies of views . it comp@@ lies with the --@@ res@@ et@@ ched command line parameter .
the warning messages range is used to control the display of warnings through hooks of no longer inqu@@ ire .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization behaviour of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set into details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Settings section , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the tree &apos;s updating frequency can be set automatically when modi@@ fying the structure tree . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ short@@ cut means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
plu@@ gins are K@@ Part applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , most well known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a booth like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read Only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin is denied loading . only @-@ read @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is activated , then Test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , whether the information entered is correct . if the plugin is not available at the moment , it will be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available to support the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ( user interface ) :
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger appears . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger anything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in the normal case it does not have to be taken care of .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bu@@ gger requirement has been started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution will proceed .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include afterwards .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were no current ones .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered , or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , can help to get better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to provide support for brand and script languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes out &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two ways , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag Fol@@ der contains two file types , the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic @-@ oriented keys of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , den &amp; open@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without risk of a write error .
tag Fol@@ der is nothing but folder . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag Fol@@ ders bear the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of an Tag@@ XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but one element of itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for class type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for Type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
this element can only happen once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags describing how to display this attribute , etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag that assem@@ bles the elements of a list . it can only happen once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the attribute text position within a dialog . this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything , but be aware of &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog appears at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , its simple instructions to follow .
this feature is currently not available yet . currently , checking is done only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following one example for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for accessible via DT@@ D processing DT@@ D settings . with this , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a list sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can set actions with Settings ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut is assigned to this action . by clicking on the user @-@ defined button a short@@ cut can be assigned , with K@@ one the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when the action is executed , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance is running , the text unique is added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when using D@@ CO@@ P for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods mentioned above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field , input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , to the standard output . it can be specified , which should be done with the text written on the standard output , by setting the value of the output box output :
when there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the brand .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window will start editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the suitable tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , in case the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog if available , so an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the menu ; , Gra@@ ph More programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this icon will include &amp; lt ; start@@ gt ; -@@ tag will be inserted in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions set ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action .
select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so there are more , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for tool@@ bars or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog on tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to make sure everything is working .
after Ne@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable enlargement of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index Top Element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 3.@@ html ... &#91; Con@@ text &#93; Con@@ text@@ List = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . it indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it out for yourself .
you notice that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will appear ! ) .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything , but make sure &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources files .
for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list and the file connection lines .
a simple list of text @-@ separated context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c , after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they won &apos;t be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the Resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different locations there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool@@ bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the others and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team considers them as correct and useful for publication . in order to make a possible contribution , we recommend that resources be signed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New resource dialog , you need to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start up@@ loading by clicking OK .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the menus DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bars , and start the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , still before installation , investigate &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message appears indicating the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files in tag@@ XML format might be necessary . there is a simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the menu DT@@ D Load and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . then the following dialog appears :
destination Name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand them and to take full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are stored for everyone named &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . from tool@@ bars to actions everything is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the Editor window , the construction view , the tab with information and the tool@@ bars . please insert in , and for more detailed information on these areas .
you can click the tab in the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document entries , such as closing the current , other or all tab , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area lead to another context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the text under the mouse cur@@ sor or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert in your document , then click on the tag that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in different fields in a dialog .
the building man@@ ners ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to open and ro@@ am them . in the presentation with learning flash@@ ers are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project management is a powerful tool that provides you with a powerful tool . this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administrator to manage files in the project by right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost anything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of the integration in Global , Lok@@ al and Project works also here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script .
with this view , one displays the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree will be opened .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it you can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development to find . it can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project specific documentation can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two tab at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts which are executed give all error messages ( so there are some ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate bar of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar Archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the configure script . to do this auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help .
if you have problems starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PA@@ TH is in front of your bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up @-@ language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why develop , what already someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only this everything possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task possible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the details of the documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or help@@ desk help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you attempt to save selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported .
converts when past@@ ing from cli@@ p@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ Description , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ Description , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script passes error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of script files and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
exit and switch on the problem @-@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project .
downloads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and if you have downloaded other input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sla@@ ves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which manages the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project files / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . that only creates the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... to be added . tool@@ bars are saved by tool@@ bars tool bars or you are asked when you exit whether you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download one &amp; DT@@ D ; , you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , your own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be ris@@ ed without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no writing enti@@ t@@ lement in the global K@@ DE file , the load will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded tool bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar in the Tags menu .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
currently this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the inser@@ tion by means of tool@@ bar den@@ ies if this day responds to the rules .
in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu points listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activated .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available emphasis schem@@ ata depends on the type ; -@@ version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; by using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes may take time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting a entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
switches the status bar display at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ( main window ) .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
establishes the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add which ones and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , as , for example , the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ g.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder in which templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . if you have failed scripts ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
let it be checked if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started anew from scratch , no hooks .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new Project Assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu item project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or altered using the Shift ; F@@ 7 key short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders available ) that are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
in addition to the above , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the profiles up@@ loading , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by showing their own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window one can turn on event actions and add , modify or delete these actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as the backup of a file .
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project that was open . you cannot influence this behavior at this time .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the project menu or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the opening and opening entries are missing ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removing the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to Program@@ ming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk store option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; ft@@ p ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for transfer . normally this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can give a lot of views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project Tool@@ bar , accessible via the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows adjusting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to their own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are the best tool for tool@@ bars . use and addition differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
the tool@@ bars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New Action , a New tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be entered into the dialog , where it can be specified , which actions on these or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action edited which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings to set actions ..
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , uses templates basically like a common fil@@ esystem with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set out at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information about the template tree is available .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents are ne@@ sted in corresponding sub@@ folders . you make a simple sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding for the purpose and organize the work in a corresponding way in order to be efficient .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can contain everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl .
as the name says , these templates serve for entire web sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File as Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate ....
once that has happened , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree .
select text in your document and click File as template save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , for example drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project file tree view , you can click on a folder to the right and create site template , enter a name for the template , and secure it . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template .
project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ enter he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically link with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link with them . additionally , you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder with the right mouse button and select properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set , it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows pre@@ defined or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project , and allows to copy content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers a whole presentation already with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second one spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back to source code editor , in which the implemented changes in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the absence of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor and the cur@@ sor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke push@@ es the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , where the position in the document is maintained .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor can be adjusted via settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is : a small span for fast calcul@@ ators and a large span for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows the change of content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ les@@ he@@ et by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file .
using the cur@@ sor is possible as in a text processing , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves peculiar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted through typing and deleted using the button or distance button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the tool@@ bar , as in the source code editor . note that inser@@ ting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars like the table assistant or the Listen @-@ assist are de@@ activated . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the performance of the style template can be followed .
to be able to compile successfully , except &amp; k@@ de ; libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without path name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or entire agreement with a template named QNAP or a specified mode name is checked . &amp; eg ; template is consistent with any my@@ QNA@@ P@@ cloud containing the template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file ; x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 is &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested fixing point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is performed automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

on systems with installed Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll through the arrow keys to / from the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the previously executed commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotation marks can be used to pass compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;

there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program used by me only showed me the modified lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it into one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time display the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you comparing and mer@@ ging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folders merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal and the other differs in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name but are located in different folders , you can make the typing work easier by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3 Fol@@ der 3
open dialog allows manual typing of fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting from the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . open dialog traces your selection and shows them next time . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences is done with two files .
on the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C however a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . in the open dialog , you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains several similar features . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , this would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d just need to create two corresponding files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out only the dropping of text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B , C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B , and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed using the settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees in the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . this is well visible in the next section ( merge ) .
when differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre @-@ processor and in a few rare cases . )
the vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks are activated , the line of broken lines is shown .
the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it contains text already , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons for the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left will appear a black bar .
this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a selection that you may copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this feature .
note : when selecting the sources , ignor@@ ing the options or activating Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navig@@ ating is mainly done with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , page from , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and C@@ tr@@ l End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the default window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the inser@@ tion button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merge and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture upward / C@@ tr@@ l image downward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict . therefore , conflicts between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the marking to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is no longer necessary .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + new@@ lines \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , so you should not use binary files .
the options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides type@@ faces with variable width to choose , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the selected font doesn &apos;t support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ger@@ ast@@ ert . on these systems , the button Pre@@ ferences automatically create an un@@ modified color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab@@ ul@@ ator key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character will be inserted .
if you press En@@ ter or Return , the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , first , all fully identical lines will be found in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a car character \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of one line , while others store only one new@@ line character &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is checked , the carriage return character may look identical , however , as a white sign is treated . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
this option is disabled in default . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
looking intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in the auto @-@ skip mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are covered in the section on the scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merger . check for details under documentation for comparison and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adap@@ ts the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart so that the change is active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
a brief indication of the local code is displayed above the selection fields for encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
modify the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding to use for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processor commands .
switch off this to supp@@ ress emphasis of changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files will be displayed . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply complete the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison window side by side or over each other . this can also be useful for displaying lengthy lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your requirements . you can use this function , for example , to cut out annoying parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this remote command . if a regular pre@@ processor command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre@@ processor command . the output of the command is only used for line interval . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that exactly meets your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program that themselves . however , good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this command command for line sequences to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . now , a pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines is needed : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you may want to perform several translations at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Er@@ ratio / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs some details otherwise . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for displaying and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm sees .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge whole folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... simul@@ ates mer@@ ging and displays the simulated changes without actually performing them ,
... performs selected actions with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , then folder 3 is used as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folders , you will be informed of a small message box about current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan will be displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or by double @-@ clicking on the object , or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the folder menu contains two functions All sub @-@ directories can be opened and all sub @-@ directories can be opened with which you can open or fold all folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the comparison window will be started and a comparison window will appear .
the icon in the Name column reflect the type of file in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge operation cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries varies .
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . with folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later , when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , er@@ ase the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the synchron@@ ization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit destination folder were specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging copies &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option to merge the new file instead of merge , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different but the same date , an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging , one file is executed after the other . it status column displays finished when mer@@ ging has been successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected happens . when mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is chosen Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odd ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you have not specified destination folder , then in the three folder mer@@ ging mode C , B is used as the target , and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped through certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory mer@@ ging / continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid mer@@ ging actions through conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the fla@@ wed elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el options .
choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select another directory entry / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , a message and detailed status information will appear . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to try again or skip the problematic entry . thus , you have the option of selecting another action for the entry or solving the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them again in the subsequent compilation of all entries . even if the merge operation was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be merged again . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set menu settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the Element@@ baum procedure . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * .@@ Fol@@ ders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element @-@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element @-@ tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous poin@@ ts@@ . a file is labeled as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element @-@ tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
links to files : if the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
when the option is turned on , the links like normal folders are treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; if the option is turned on , a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
exec@@ utes a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower , when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to familiar to the modification date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal in size . this can , for example , be useful when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activate the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the merge suggestions are selected to merge both folders . the results of mer@@ ging files will also be stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal merge of single files , not only the merge of entire folders . this option is switched on in default .
normally , the merge view remains visible to merge individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the directory and text window to the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views .
you can also directly combine a single file directly without having to run the folder . to do so , you can merge a single file directly without having to run the folder together . to do so , use the current file mer@@ ging from the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be saved and the file will not be merged once you start the folder .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency using K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change dates . therefore , per@@ missions or change dates devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ ant of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference in viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the contex@@ tual menu .
normally required &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a K@@ Part , then decreases &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to recover the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ IN mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it is compact ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that mer@@ ging can be like the diff@@ 3 program from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and have learned a lot while I &apos;ve looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this path or will go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure will install in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical , but if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines appear to each other , this is more than this is often the case .
it is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source text and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information .
the effort was too big so far . you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used another editor .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use a different editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
you can find a list of recent changes under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ de@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir provides the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties still occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift insert ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current marker .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in destination folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update feature . )
this also means that identical files are not copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will likely change in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . under@@ lines in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both within one desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ tops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in both work@@ tops as well as on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and exit . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries will appear :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working surfaces .
when this field is selected , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager display ; the numbers of virtual working areas display . if it is inter@@ sec@@ ted with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is selected , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in &amp; p@@ ager .
when this field is selected , the running programs are shown as small windows in the p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces will be displayed to allow them to be selected .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angle with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the order of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N @-@ grid , as shown from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual working areas in horizontal and vertical right in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display and move the windows as symbols or with their content .
right @-@ click within &amp; C@@ p@@ ager ; and set up switch to set switch ... allows the dialog settings to appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog box . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ er@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have any write permission for the file , you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator .

&amp; K@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can zoom in with &amp; K@@ mag ; you can read a part of the screen as if you are reading a lou@@ pe for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being extended with new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as pictured above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag displays the enlarged area of the screen . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting increases &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter is like a mobile lou@@ pe . alternatively , you can &amp; K@@ mag ; set up a select screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( select window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the Shift + Shift key , or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the drop down window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it into a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
starts / stops the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set of short commands to save files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ading in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ staff@@ ier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; you can use a magni@@ fier to view the print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains at the same place for a while . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ pun@@ in @-@ in@@ jury syndrome ) and cause pain to any mouse click .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains at the same place for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and can em@@ ulate pain every mouse click .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . suffering from pain related to the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool helps to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse , and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement briefly .
if the smart move is activated , make &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before letting the mouse button run out . in this way , you can drag the pull with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shifting requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time has to pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click runs out .
when Intel@@ lig@@ ently is switched on , the rotation @-@ field is active ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after clicking the mouse button , wait before it release the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse shift . if this function is enabled , a slow moving is created to the right and back , followed by a pause , one click with the right mouse button . this moves in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started but can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there &apos;s a slide control sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
this option is marked with &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program automatically .
set all settings back to the values set when the dialog is opened . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be switched off at first . if you are used to the automatic mouse click , you can later lose the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . it &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take out the mouse ball . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . it should be clear , however , if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can scra@@ pe the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if just a move is started . if you use the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you execute a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor wherever you want it . but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to have a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent slide , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can deal with it . it is very possible to mark text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will likely cause them problems . here are some advice on this :
don &apos;t use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use . select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will each time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the move @-@ time starts when the smart move is moving . later , you can use the intelligent slide without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
in order to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are properly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor is short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and who are causing pain to num@@ b the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drawing process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , the drag and drop can also be done with the mouse .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a program that allows silent users to talk to their computer for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the program &amp; c@@ mouth , dum@@ b users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sentences from a list with the conversation course that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text passages . from the text passages you can often select passages from text passages without having to type them . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you can define the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main window of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pan@@ mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the bottom white field in the screen shot ) and a exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the sentences already spoken ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have mouth , set correctly , you can enter the sets you want to hear in the input field . each spoken set is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again .
with the menu entry Settings Ch@@ art ; set up ... open the preferences dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two learning flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page word completion as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD voice service .
in the input field of the map voice output , enter the command to call the Language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , you define the character encoding with which the text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed unchanged as default input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples are available in the app@@ endi@@ x .
the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output , which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option makes sense even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , after selecting a passage passage , you decide which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a passage in the text passages book or in the bar for text passages .
when selecting from In the input field , the selected passage of the passage is inserted directly into the input field . the selected passage of the passage is entered only in the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text passages should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
when selecting Modi@@ fying Text passages , the book is stored . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text passages guide will not be saved .
the word &apos; word &apos; page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down sel@@ ector , if this list contains more than one dictionary .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the sel@@ ector field the language for the dictionary .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these dic@@ tion@@ aries are to be wei@@ ghted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of the text or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books you can either click on the choice in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or passages of text can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iring memory .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected ranges of the exp@@ iring memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ eller .
when this menu entry is selected , a sli@@ dable tool@@ bar is displayed using buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default over the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is selected , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with references to the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
when this menu entry is selected , a sli@@ dable bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is arranged above the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you did not enter the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open Settings c@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the University of Edinburgh is a voice @-@ over@@ s system . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ sh are supported .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory . the voice output command then reads :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows Free@@ T@@ TS to be used free of charge and without further restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ tet . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the use of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax would like to swallow the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :

the language output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; c@@ mouth ; set .
to set the settings , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the preferences dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the speech generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that allows people who can &apos;t talk to print text by the computer . it stores a list of already spoken phrases that the user can always re @-@ spend .
note that there is no speech syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ desk help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text over the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program@@ mers willing to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; posters ; , even if &amp; posters ; embedded in other &amp; quot ; applications .
speech output is provided via the speech dispens@@ er program , which uses various background events such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the language edition service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without any visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; kate ; , with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ mailing list .
before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts , you need to install and configure the speech @-@ dispat@@ cher program .
at the first start of kt@@ m@@ m@@ gr or as long as there are no speakers set up , the map card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker installed , the card card is displayed in general .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , the speed @-@ dispat@@ cher program otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on the tab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab speaker in kt@@ m@@ gr &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the tab card is displayed . it also automatically appears when you start kt@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click , and click this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select here a type of voice , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker appears on the tab card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card file General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start . see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text orders .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language output system by &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when t@@ week@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the system area of the control bar while reading , it disappears again as soon as the reading is finished .
with the buttons in this series , you can start , break , pause and record text orders .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check the language edition ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check the text to be read and select text in the main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ he@@ aders and other invisible marks are also read .
in &amp; Out ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check the text to be read and select Text to read in the main menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works when &amp; posters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system , noti@@ fying you about events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up a message in which your nick@@ name appears in an I@@ RC channel . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supported by a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy vary depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the package of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as pres@@ upp@@ osed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
filters are processed in filters before being sent to the speech dispens@@ er program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation in order to replace wrong spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the working of filters , it is important to know how the &quot; speech dispens@@ er &quot; program works with a text .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps them in place . if the output of the screen reader is read , the queu@@ ed orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; Noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you send from the card card orders is a text assignment . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the issu@@ ance of longer texts , which do not have any particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just reading such a screen , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to screen readers output . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there are even more types of filters available .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . you can either specify the parts to be replaced , either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is delivered with pre@@ defined string sub@@ stitution filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way .
&amp; XML ; -@@ conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . in the scope of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in S@@ Sm@@ l .
with speaker selection filters you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card @-@ card speaker , you can read the text of K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it passes the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ notification to &amp; kt@@ ts is sent , it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below . processing by filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of standard filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
for setting string replacement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can select this name as you like , it just has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ compose . the list is processed in the shown order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file and app@@ end the entries from the file to the existing list .
if you enter a language here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when you click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ key pressed .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers you have to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only type kop@@ ete .
the string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Fil@@ ters when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions can be found in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such de@@ formations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available via the environment variable PA@@ TH , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set up on the card card speaker , or to a speaker with specific properties . for example , you can specify that text from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is handed over to the filters , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker features which specify the program , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which matches the desired requirements most likely . click on the button to the right to display the dialogue group selection .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the language edition API by &amp; k@@ de ; . the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from program kt@@ ts@@ d to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , please
open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . first start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Form@@ ing filter , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or just chew@@ ing f@@ lange is spent . what can I do about it ?
first of all , make sure the sign encoding option is set to the correct language value . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a string replacement filter .

K@@ T@@ TS works with each voice syn@@ thesizer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , draw the description of the Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , by information , which are not yet included in this manual .
the &quot; speech dispens@@ er &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; to use another syn@@ thesizer , contact the development team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of S@@ Sm@@ l and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including package k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the &quot; speech Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program .
translate and install the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download and install the program with the following commands from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ bug or downloaded tar@@ ball each night :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , make sure that speech @-@ dispat@@ cher works properly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do this .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr will be developed in such a way that the set @-@ up of speech dispens@@ ers is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is broken down into single sentences . the user can leave stat@@ ute or paragraph style , repeat , pause or break the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , it will be used automatically the best suitable speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in .
when you click Add Player to Add a speaker to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the Cart@@ ridge Spe@@ aker Setup will be displayed . as an example , the device of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that is handed over to the festival . for voices , which are &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slider lets you adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controller and displayed this grey , the voice you choose doesn &apos;t allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster ( with higher memory consumption ) .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click on the user ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ m@@ gr will be displayed in the program window at the start of the program window . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr still does not work , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD read a text . thus , you have the possibility to stop reading or otherwise control .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed set .
with the buttons in this series , you can pre@@ - or go back on the order selected in the list below . ( but not each order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . expenses of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , choose the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ bsp ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ 00 ; % about the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program needs to be so@@ x installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text assignment is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language entries :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps them in place . once the screen reader &apos;s output has been read , the queu@@ ed orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you are &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can with &amp; c@@ mouth ; still welcome anyone entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is played whenever a normal text order is interrupted . if both the sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the incoming message .
the settings on this card are valid only for normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and the expense of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ m@@ gr and click Noti@@ fications . the card card noti@@ fications will appear .
check this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the other settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played will be read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; convers@@ ational ; sends when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected custom text , enter the text you want . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
here you can enter the properties of the speaker you want . default select the speaker that is displayed in the list on the tab speaker as the top entry .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All Noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the button Store to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( S@@ Sm@@ l ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard contains stamps for the control of voices , voice speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; S@@ Sm@@ l only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations exist :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice , the festival used in the issue of S@@ Sm@@ l .
if the settings for speed or pitch are not set to 100 % in the festival configuration dialog , S@@ Sm@@ l text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; !

there are two types of filters - normal filters and stat@@ ute recognition filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can begin to sub@@ divide text into single sentences , since only the first set needs to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text assignment .
here you can see the stat@@ ute recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limits recognition filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add more set limits filters , but beginners will get off .
the easiest way to do this is to test the selection of speakers . turn on the selection of speakers and select text for reading . switch the speaker selection again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker changes . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time ,
you can then pause or stop text orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal stat@@ ute recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only be removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set boundaries recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the set boundaries ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set identi@@ fier filter retains the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( noti@@ fications ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; select the method to enter the desired speaker features by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
mark this check box if the property should have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also place multiple marks here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies ahead if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the speaker area , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default Spe@@ aker button and then use on speakers that will most likely match the following .
in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without the order number the input 0 is required ) .

festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions in passing on .

festival is usually included in the Linux distri@@ butions , so search the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; this generates the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ ph@@ onic files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival creates these by &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be generated from German text di@@ phone . more information can be found here .
in this process additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the file festival / lib / .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after the installation , a new module network settings will be displayed at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the Network Set@@ ting module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware can not be installed . physical devices and their drivers must have already been installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed with Inst@@ alling Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be charged by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list which is best suited to the distribution and the release date . selecting the non @-@ re @-@ en@@ quiries can be set up permanently .
changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you can enter the system administration mode at the right bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three Reiter :
the network interface is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed from the network interfaces :
the settings displayed on the network can be set up by selecting the device you want to set up in the list and click the button interface ... set up in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options .
with the selection Automatic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from one D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are executed at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the selection manual , you can set the TCP / IP configuration without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
depending on your needs , network devices can be enabled or turned off . switch on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
depending on your needs , network devices can be enabled or turned off . turn off a disabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
speci@@ fies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requires ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution part of the name resolution calcul@@ ator provides a simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be assigned to the list by selecting an entry or down@@ grade or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons down or down .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select one entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog .
the List Nam@@ ed Calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of well @-@ known hosts contains some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in review is intended to replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add ... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
enter the name of the well @-@ known machine and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known machine has several alias names , press de button Add multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit .... dialog Modi@@ fied hosts will be displayed .
it can be performed one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK , the list of static hosts is updated .
the settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , you can use a graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile , and k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do so .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; modi@@ fiable configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is provided .
IP networks are currently being used with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to run through in the near future .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; the network administrator can use the address that matches a valid IP address or , if available , can be used D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address can not be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specifically reserved area for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are mostly used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . the default route is required for the IP for@@ warding .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf are located and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content than specified in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a security program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first thing was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing .
before a tape can be used , it must be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; ult the tape back and read the pr@@ elo@@ ad information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the pr@@ elo@@ ad on the tape , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pr@@ elo@@ ad , searches for the right index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index is to be re@@ written .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by opening the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the strap , the integration must first be resolved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize , that the integration for the tape was loos@@ ened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting with &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted before using the tape . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the strap continues . all data on the tape is lost ! after finishing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically included and ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only save this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a check@@ box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
ri@@ ght@@ click the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up settings for f@@ use . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for the backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check@@ box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item Veri@@ fy ....
once the check@@ out process has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for review .
if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be recovered .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check@@ box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog appears settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog appears again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the band inde@@ x@@ file based on the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the tape :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in the same file system are backed up , such as the folder . folders that lie on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be stored separately from backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then will be backed up .
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file from tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , transmitted and k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command mt load to the drive . on some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the ej@@ ection during the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
when the option is enabled , the tape will automatically dis@@ connect and dis@@ connect it . do not use this option with flo@@ ppy spre@@ aders .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this icon is only active when a tape is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system has stored the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - to open . if you don &apos;t see them , and it opens instead a small message window , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most probably do not have system administrator privileges .
you can also use the filter bar in order to filter by a selected criterion or after entered strings . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter will be displayed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed . then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns .
of course , you can also select another entry . the string of the filter search term will then be matched only with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system log , select the column process , and carry in the filter bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color as a step message . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setting dialog .
if you want to show only certain process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command , such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bars .
in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own web page on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you will find more up @-@ to @-@ date information about the source sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can be found in the following folder : \ k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and also named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the system V In@@ it develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program start when the system is bo@@ oting in the Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting .
the sy@@ s@@ v in@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service you want to start when you start the system or when you switch to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is started only once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d .
the kernel searches for the program in@@ it at different places and starts the first one .
the standard Run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning section you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably realize that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to change something , then you can fix it by re@@ starting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? simple : each script is written so that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K contains , the script is called up with the argument . if it contains an S , the script will be called up with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user running level , which &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on that level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ levels or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) .
note : entries are moved if you drag them to a new area . to merely copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Cop@@ y from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target range -- even if the same entry already existed in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired running level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab@@ ul@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; then changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ levels , and now the machine starts to restart . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you must edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using any other distribution , please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) are simply termin@@ ated if their configuration files are not present or configured incor@@ rectly .
the importance of Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tion of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you make any changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog for user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you activate space restrictions ( quota ) for users will be created with a card card on which you can make individual settings .
the tab card management appears if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD univers@@ es .
this card only appears if for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation .
the map card groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Pri@@ mary School field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the big field .
the group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add user or group from the menu , or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group functions an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boat manager , add , remove and change boot pass@@ wort , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
