<seg id="1">To translate the module website you will find in the & konqueror; menu under Extras page. from the drop-down list, select the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated into place of the whole & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. in the best case Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page by yourself, where you can insert too translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the Handbook to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; to load, select Settings extension.... Open the map card tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the box kde; addons. please note that any more modules on your system are available if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page which & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module View filter (also called Folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras View filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display starts with the top node of the document, example: documentelement.All other nodes are sub-elements of this node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if they are far below the folder hierarchy. accordingly, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. to facilitate navigation, the rectangles also have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over View color mode can be either depth for the easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it will be displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display, or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (although this may result in the relative position of the caption in the rectangle).</seg>
<seg id="19">With performance algorithms for treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. with the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always respected. note that less space for the frame is lost when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">The layout of the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left up to the implementation. here, it is possible to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can define the minimally displayed area for an entry above the menu entry View on area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn in the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower item.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget designed for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you view the gallery image gallery, a dialog opens with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the option" "" "Title" "" "allows you to customize the title of the gallery page in a text input field." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per row has a scroll bar and a swivel panel to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the filename of the image, show whether the filenames are shown under the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">Check the image size of the image to see if the file size is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you specify whether the size of the images is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the dialog folder, you specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save in HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">To include subfolders with the check box, you can set with a slide bar or a turning field, up to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy original pictures with the check box to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">To use the comment file check box, you can specify a comment file for the caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Height Color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnail images as in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; -Settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; -settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML: settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the" "" "Confqueror" "" "menu under Windows" "" "Navigation" "" "menu or with the button" "" "F9" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the Navigation Pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing browser detection adds a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition, you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you are coming to a web page that deny access to this browser, change browser detection to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password to MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser detection to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are correctly represented by using this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser detection is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in detail.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; -module check your & CSS; style templates and & HTML; -documents in accordance with the recommendations of W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the module's website in the & konqueror; check the menu under Extras page. you can do the following checks:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check out if your & HTML; -document corresponds to the syntax of & HTML; all found bugs will be displayed. with this test you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to check your & CSS; style sheets included in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document. with valid & CSS; your web pages have a unified look regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Checks the links on your page for further lines and erroneous links. recursively all links are checked on the website.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you place the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; -documents and & CSS; style sheets fixed.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web Archiver for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in .was format.</seg>
<seg id="53">Use the mouse to archive your website and a dialog appears to save the displayed website.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to & digiti. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gPhoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digitized.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digitized; includes fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, rate and correct your photos. editing skills can easily be extended with KDE Image plug-in interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitized, easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in the 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or lens, which can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and opportunities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitized; tries to make the reporting of problems or improvement proposals as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests.... This opens a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the Troubleshooting system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digitized; is a project supported by a community. that means users and developers can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digitized, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of & digi.In this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage to find news about released versions and other information about & digicam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved & digitized; to participate is logging in the developer mailing list. instructions to log in to the developer mailing list by & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & digitize; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. just enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data file is stored. this path stays the same for all the image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digitized; will additionally use as albian library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder. & digitized; view any subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitized; cut the library path in its entirety. you cannot exclude any subfolders unless it is hidden in hidden folders. this can be done by setting a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and dropping it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywordlist to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, you may also deal with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help RohkameraSupport menu.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-DecoderSettings and Roh workflows.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to & digiti. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gPhoto2 library. of course, any media and card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digitized.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. for the actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digitized; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digitized; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">The exif support is needed by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the preview images. if the exif support is not present in libgPhoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to & digitized; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for & digitized;, KPhotoAlbum, Shovmg and gwenview. the aim is to make the modules available to all graphic programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitized; by writing a small module to complete a function, when the changes in & digicam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the alb tree, above the horizontal partition line or in another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be dropped in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus filtering on the file name only works if this is also displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed you can configure in the dialog of the Albian Settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos that were edited by & digi.These albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the Albenign or after the date the album was created first. the date can be changed in the characteristics of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. to do this, select Album Importieren pictures. you can also add a screen shot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can drag the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu, you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select album properties in the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos when you select from collection from the toolbar or view albums sorted by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums and sort by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elders, Average, New Years: these set the date on the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first recorded an album in & edited, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digitized; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword list on the left bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. for collection always include all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo will be previewed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two loupe buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album the first time, you must wait a little while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this in which you can recreate all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the preview. what information this is, you can edit via Settings; set up. select the albums page and adjust the range of thumbnails to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse cursor rest for a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the main window section shows such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. the image processing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can select all the features that are edited with & digi.You can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by using either F4 image editing... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit... Select a guide how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digitized; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type submenu. for this, and how to adjust them to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing by other image editing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the image can occur. some programs do not store this data with when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digitized; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select the rotation. in the sub-menu, you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. be aware that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you select a photo from & digipa.Delete, it will be moved to the bin folder by & kde; Delete. F8 Picture Delete or Del. if you prefer to really delete it, you can use this by using Shift + Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumelistequot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digitized; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the datasheet at the bottom of the data view so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found again by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. by this, you can organize your keywords logical. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword listequot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The key words are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. you can also use your keywords in other programs as soon as the data loss is lost, as soon as digitized the images.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword, or on an existing keyword and then selecting New keyword. if you have clicked a new keyword, after you clicked on an existing keyword, it becomes the subcommand of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting a keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you have chosen the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword, drag and drop them. alternatively, you can also right-click on the preview images and select keyword from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way, you can select a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keyword, this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button and select from the Tags menu Remove from the menu. the menu only shows you the keywords that have been assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependent adjustment of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you only have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame that indicates the time unit. thus, all associated images are displayed in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. it then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click here, the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again. if you haven't found anything, then the lamp will turn red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this, you get a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be performed. the results will be used in the My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching, you only have to select the corresponding entry from my search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When selecting Edit, the Search box appears again with the search information you entered. if you select As an advanced search, the dialog for the advanced search appears to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced Search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced Search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search for in certain fields of & digi.s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group deleting or deleted from it. any option can be linked to other via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitized; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they conform to. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one. by pushing a picture from anywhere on the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; finds the right pictures. even here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can move in or zoom out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it. push it while you click the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this of course assumes that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digitized; provides a luminous table in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images. it works with all supported image data formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L to add the luminescent from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminous table and its window is opened. if you are back in & digicam; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L extras.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview pane you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window and place it there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is visible. if you want to synchronize preview from the toolbar and carry out a zoo or imposition operations on one of the images, then these are also performed on the other image. you can therefore compare the same range of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of pictures. if you use pairing mode from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparing. use now the left mouse button on any thumbnail to see it in the left-hand side. the right adjacent image is displayed in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal fire-out actions also work directly from the luminous table as e.g. F4 file Editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the luminescent table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to swivel the visible area of the image, you have to click it and hold the & LMB; in the preview mode, both images will be shown in the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming will work as well as in other views. simply use the zoom controller under the images or Ctrl; scroll to the image and zoom out. this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital stock management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken until the final issue and permanent storage. each of the photos receipts, scans or digital photos captures a form of digital stock management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and re-use your images. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers which can back and use them. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, securing, evaluating, substituting, archiving, optimising, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital stock management takes up, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transformations, confers and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is based on your definition data that provides information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digitized;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searching and a secure archive that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to have other access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly over your location, unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% working files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the metadata saving option in the metadata entry page. this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what if you want to change which ones? for that purpose, & digitized; they provide them with a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should assign keywords, labels and an evaluation to any photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos in the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's proceed with keywords, keywords, as you often name in other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digitized; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by drawing a subtree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapping itself. this is a very rough representation, since every block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone know your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream, to have associations, memories, the historical time span is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title is possibly more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you show images you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time. KDE even provides you with a spell checker.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times ahead of GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with images, the move of the spatial presentation now starts with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels with geographic information. & digitized; can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth. however, you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc, with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a wordplay with copyright and designates the practice to use copyrights to remove constraints on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information on the setup page of & digicam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, for example to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's work description. examples of this can be titles such as: employee Photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher: use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here that you can see the image others. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the image will be given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against misuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or change this in the image. for individuals, this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique every picture. & digitized; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate error, plate loss, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a brand. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, problems with the so-called new media are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which cause data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">Of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, more difficult to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there's a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently works wonders with CDs and DVDs. it runs on Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB.</seg>
<seg id="185">Then you should read the media with a description, date & author and then store them on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that this media can read.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers retain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturer warrants include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the fault mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">The most common error reason is SMART. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART cannot detect these errors. some of the errors detected by SMART indicate the imminent failure. these are especially read errors and retention tags. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also avoid data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">During most electric appliances electric shocks don't matter much, this can be done differently in devices with computer chips and high-speed processes. these can cause severe damage on your computer. thus, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware ageing, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable result to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. remember, however, that not every plug-in bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Because there is an overvoltage of each cable to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as well. some manufacturers provide overvoltage spikes which also offer a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes them ideal for on-the-go.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a interruption-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power failure occurs. some models allow you to continue working until the current runs. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the cost to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20 costs, A 500W UPS you can pay for less than & euro; 40.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically cleared thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies there is a backup and distribution included in the offer. thus, they are safe for desasterism.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transmissions are vulnerable to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transmission fault occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you one day open a photo and this to your surprise is destroyed. no one seems ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at the moment, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS by Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with plate errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard under a license incompatible with GPL.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. it is still in alpha status. it uses the same protective mechanisms the ZFS uses and is also available for Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss on the notebook and 46% on workstation systems. in notebooks, the percentage of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to reduced damage, e.g. theft or new installations. and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; for a long time no one has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems. find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, just the speed of the investigation process during a sudden stop during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been stored completely before the problem occured, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings away from fundamental physical boundaries. this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not blame others for data loss. thus, your data is often affected by data loss every year. thus, backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, replacing plates or resizing drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane crashes: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means not local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as said above is a common reason for loss of data despite backup the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: securing the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original state at any time on which such a backup has been made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transmission scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that were actually changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come for the backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end, you have a complete daily release of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for every month. any further dilution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, original retain, store, scalability, media, rediscover images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unforeseeable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to let yourself be felt like the current system backwards. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: each time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned scalability and extended the range you want to enlarge to a dedicated disk or partition. in * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, if your new record has been detected by the system, but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source; default / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source; # functions with ext2, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & Dollars; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 #</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, you can create them yourself. this task will become easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). with some cameras you can save your images in this format. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG Digital negative file format is a license-free and open image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the needs to unify the camera formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and requires the use of metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive the original image, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits this because it saves the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve extensive acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera image, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your Roharchive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing, you can use external programs. if you re-edit the images, edit, then you should add the metadata again. these were under circumstances cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them into web galleries, code into MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiti. in the Adding a photo to an album you will find a description on how to add photos you have already on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, connect them to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When the connection is made, a Fertig indicator at the bottom and thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol are displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page strips properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information that is stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that for some digital cameras not all information is available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer's remark, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as for the metadata side bar of the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then the selection of all. downloading will not delete the photos and we suggest you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired with the standard selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the download button and then select Selected. the button Selected download is grayed out until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option NEW is available. these images have not been edited by & digi.In this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you can download all the buttons or download selected albums, a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is displayed, as normal folder sorted. then select the list of the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK and & & digitized; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the Delete All button. if you want to delete only some, you need to select them first and then delete them deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a & digitized album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do so via the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are normally re-used after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can result in duplicate filenames, if you load photos of different recording galleries into the same album. therefore, it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based baskets. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two relate the data about the author in the Standard Autoridentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the exif information to the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can, for example, use the prefix foto-% Y-% d% d% H:% S in the editing area. to do so, switch the date & time option. for further adjustments, you should read the help of strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filenames, you have the option to change the file name in lowercase or in uppercase if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which was edited and edited for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitized; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform an automatic turn during download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section page bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, & digitized; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to disable automatic turn, use the Extended button and select the automatic turn in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made, you can use it to automatically create sub-albums on the target album. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case & digitized; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you have to disable this option. to do so, use the Extended button and select the option Date-based sub-albums at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button download. then choose upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, & digitized; you, where the images are to be uploaded. a folder chooser dialog appears for the camera. select the folder you want and press OK to start uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in length and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. determining the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser to indicate the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digipa.If you want to send a postcard to another & digitized, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, trailers and map references.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transferring the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>

<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format, since this is the only format supported by the geographical assignment module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the exifTool from Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals hairy coordinates created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com shows no European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitized; try to give you so much control over its work processes as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digicam; change. to access these settings, you need to change in the Settings menu; set up. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing. you set the default behavior of & digicam; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the relevant IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's title: this field should contain the photographer's professional title. this may be designations such as photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author's field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify which the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if he works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC Felder. this achieves that metadata is permanently included in the image, and not only in the digitized database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digi.It can be imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image captions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments that you add to your photos, with the lettering embedded in the images. this allows you to read your lettering from other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests on a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitized; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digitization; to indicate which file types & digitization; to show, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by clicking the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">This page can be set to the default values. however, each time you open the luminous table, these settings will be turned on. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can disable the toolbar if you use image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling, it is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">This reduces the size of the TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality, since the Deflate algorithm is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">Even if you select the loss-free setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than the normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata hasn't been supported yet, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digikam, image processing was only one image viewer for photos. at present, it is quickly becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">If you use this option, you solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option excels the image slightly softly, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the auto-color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance, which was photographed in the sunlight on a white card.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps gain more detail in the top lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the taillights, so the parts of your images are burned into, because of the inability of your camera to catch the peak lights, as a continuous white. use the setting of transparent white in the settings. the setting colors release some unusual results, since they are the pointed-lights in various robes. finally, you can attempt to construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general don't saturate as fast as green and red. & dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option reconstruct, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1, but this can also be done later in the editing options of the & digipa.To keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should go conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the part raw data that comes from the color filtered image sensor that has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">And Dcraw provides you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks like AHD interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color softening since you are done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions on how to be given again. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as colour information from a colour space in the other to translate so the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in the editing / color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Quit the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you store all your profiles. & digitized; examine these folders during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are built in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain any color-mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate, as your picture may be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image, since your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious what color profile is provided for. unfortunately, not with Canon models. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface that is supported by a set of & kde; image viewers and image editing. by picking up this interface, & digicam; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be edited by & digi.These modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">For more information about KIPI modules, see the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper controller adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features are shown on the left-hand side a list of all currently supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. this includes the port settings. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera bar.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, get it into the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & edited; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it will be displayed in the main window's menu. if you have more than one camera, you can paste it here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving pictures in the trashboards you can adjust the dialog by & digi.When you delete a photo in an album, you will find more details when you delete a photo and delete an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly edited by & digi.If you use the option changes in the right sidebar without using any queries, otherwise you need to use the changes with the button to apply changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the & digitised welcome screen; when starting, this accelerates the boot of & digitized;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting At start looking for new photos forces & digitized; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extended the start time of & digikam;. if something was deleted from the base folder, & digitized; you, if it should delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & edited; used to customize the main window to your taste. you can select these settings using Settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digicam; to create, you will find further information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitized; includes fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and selection of the entry Ads / Editing.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digi.You may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, which shows file name, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A toolbar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using Save or Save the button Save from the toolbar. note that you can't restore the original photo as soon as you saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before changing it. you can do this with file saving as well.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Recovery menu or the Restore button to restore image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you've done on the photo since last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any editing of the image processing can be undone or restored. undo the last action by modifying or restoring, by selecting Edit Recover from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you select the & LMB; over the Retreat or Restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same Album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and zoom out in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarger factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc key. if you do not want this, you can change it in the editing dialog by & digi.This can be viewed from & edited; main window. see the section for setting up image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the File Image menu and get the standard & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sentences. you only have to select the images from your selection. you only have to select the images using the standard methods and select print job from the menu album Exports. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page header is available without the navigation arrows, even in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible, meaning that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and is limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are deformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the use button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field of Regency. the code follows the diagram in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the key word tree and a drop-down box with keyword names used in this digitising session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can restrict the number of ways to search for a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you typed a number of keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field.</seg>
<seg id="365">If several images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is applied only to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the Keyword Filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - date, keyword and search views. if one or more keyword filters are used from the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and discard keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and place it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is set to no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be disabled under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and notice that it should be one or its, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set an Advanced search across all the elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group group. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why have Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly edited it & edited it; s concrete implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one uses a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner can have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that match the colors that you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to push for the results they want. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow matches all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image editions are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another colour space and make thoughts about color blur?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB's limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular area.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB working spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to monitor my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to monitor your monitor because sRGB means that your monitor is sRGB. if you work as sRGB colour space, you either need to install your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve one image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting more manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, offset, Automatic calibration and contrast extend from the menu Conducting Automatic Correction try automatically out of your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaling the brightness values across the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point will be as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Comparisons: this method adjusts the luminance reactor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity canal becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the same results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balance: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright boundary-tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enhance contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new jiusading of all values in between. this is only visible in selected pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digitized; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because you have a color space with 8-bit color. if you are too far away from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can do the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry Colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left, you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool settings. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The target image preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right you see a histogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment allows you to improve or down shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the preset list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in the white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as and Uploading make this exactly. any adjustment of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original image. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better for high quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be done through the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted in chapter Colour Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">This tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels simultaneously and allows you to save your settings so that you can use them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always makes the same error and you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitized; tool color effects provides you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, was an effect that was created when one made a partially developed print a short flashlight and then the development of the picture completed. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solarisation. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment creates a negative image, so that it is not possible to produce photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation Effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliantly and glowing. just try it, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrasting edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeats the strength of the neon light. in large pictures the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and therefore it is not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos. you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one to great saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the results you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tools gradation and the simple Leukthickness / Contrast / Gamma, the tool clay-value correction is used to improve exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool works very complicated, you need only the area of the slider to explain this application. more concrete the three slide valves below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected range. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into them and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate is to move the controller and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right-hand side, the original and thumbnail preview can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to set the histogram with a linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulators: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in previewing the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to change the output values as interactively as in the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create an extended image as a background while something else is seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. for this purpose, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">When using this mode and the three color pipette, the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows, media and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input of the Histograms for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator checks all color channels to find exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of adjusting the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha Channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this box allows to specify the channel to be changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is usually the linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a crank to the right, e.g. the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the associated image pixels disappear.</seg>
<seg id="436">When you move this marker to the range you want to change, a matching line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. every curve that you generated can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp crank format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three Color pipette buttons automatically create the vertices of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curves.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator checks all color channels to display over exposed pixels. if detected in more than one channel, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the Luminance Channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digicam; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or to change the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channel by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison with one's own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line in the histogram will display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are right below: control for red, green and construction permit you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will retain the general brightness as well, since the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the color space. the colour space consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and their noise pattern in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Save as and load buttons are used for this purpose. any blender settings can be saved for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator checks all color channels to find exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the luminance option is activated. the original picture can be seen in (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as colour pictures can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky. so similar to 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">OrangeFilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic ascension effects and can simulate Moon Light scenes at daytime. so similar to 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lentil filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of the absence of a pressure and the redevelopment in a sepiate. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digicam; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With & digicam; tool frame add can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your picture. the image with a colored line, Niepce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), rounded it with a nice three-dimensional frame.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio before using.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple, formatted text into an image at any location, even if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text orientation, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & digicam; tool stencil Apply you can place a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image stencil template can be used in image processing to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) for reduction of the file size of the template. if you want to add your stencil template, simply send an e-mail in English to which & digikam; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button root folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the templates. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder will automatically update the template's preview bar.</seg>
<seg id="474">The preview contains three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button resets the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must decrease the image accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="477">Postpone: use this button to move the picture lying under the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by copyright by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a bit more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of sharpness. this is due to the digitalisation process colours with minimal differences to one color dot. this in turn results in a slight blur. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more after sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera has often been used for internal sharpness. images in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a follow-up filter while reading the image. if you deactivate this, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness of the focus. you can call this with the menu entry Corcorrected sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should handle this with caution because the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also reinforces the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image sharpens the tool. under refocusing, you find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little softly is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool for softening with the menu entry Corrigible plasticizing and experiment with some settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount enhances the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates are caused near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, they should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applied difference-amount. thus, you can define a minimal difference with it for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from the sharper and therefore flaw errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blur mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). fuzzy masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digitized; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright protected defeit detection algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocusing quot; in which it reverses the focus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna Filtration. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocus mostly results in better results than calling colors refocusing in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">The Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical results also from the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel. the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß's folding is sometimes very strongly influenced by the distant pixels, causing unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase of the noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. this is most often caused by a previously executed blur filter. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you have chosen large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauss's sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations modifications that are not visible immediately, but later leave unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by using the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">For the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. in practice, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the focus corrections methods in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">"" "the" "" "slider" "" "regulates the blurring of the area of the darkened area in order to create a more natural pupil." ""</seg>
<seg id="514">The colour ink allows for a modified paint for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen, France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the image. whereas greater values predominate mainly homogeneous regions and details are sharp. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is required afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth only in one direction. if you have a film granulator or CCD-rushing will create a high value undulating pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular step width here [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. therefore, you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation Use: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal. it doubles the running time. therefore, we recommend it to let it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and Uploading make this exactly. any setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time to load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">The module is used in a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analogue camera. as you can see, there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip. the original image is under (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitized; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy rushing that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius monitors the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters are needed per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value defines the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and noise or lubricating occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong you can't remove all the noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maxim, if you want to remove a weak rushing or JPEG-artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamemolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically stronger.</seg>
<seg id="541">This value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations in luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother if it is too high. if it is on its minimum, noise and phase jitter may occur at the edges. it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all noise reduction parameters that you have set can be stored in the filesystem and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the image softly is much easier than to sharpen a picture. use tool for softening the soft sign with the menu entry Corrigible plasticizing and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undesired artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granularity, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or retrospectively digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">To reduce JPEG's artifacts: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossless compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; artefacts; - small standards that are seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and Uploading make this exactly. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time to load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that was taken with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie grading on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old color photo that was read by a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that were caused by the scanner lighting and the photo paper. the original image is under (1) to be seen and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPIxi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; to remove on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the Dark Picture button. the tool will automatically recognize the hot and bright pixels. these will be highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you pick up the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you correct the result inside the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with current settings. poor pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Cut: an average of the adjacent pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtermethod. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square interface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been magnified to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitized; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo formats, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range evenly. instead, & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) it the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters need one factor 1,5 or 2 for aperture filters, which may cause the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also use a center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise blur effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the wide exposure range of today's filtration and grayscale depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalent transformation to a shell image without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction addresses the transformation with a Centerfilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, corresponding to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast, and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignette correction reduces the luminosity of pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminance / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicam; image processing from the Color Gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digicam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm from David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortion. color distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second graph covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of fourth degree corrects the remote corners to that of the second gradient. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can almost be eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the thickness of the second degree distortion. with negative values, barrel-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Vertices: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth degree. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter' has the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size, resulting in a correction of first degree. negative values increase while positive the image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog shows a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The toning / kissing-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or resizing changes. best perform this correction as the first one. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a tonne-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important location, such as the sea rim or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tonnen- / kissensing distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the cutting tool in the Transform Transformers Cut off the image processing or using the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as recordings from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera by hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonnular correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2) to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web page which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared movie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">If you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film, you can preview two parameters. if you want to simulate the granular texture of a highly sensitive film, the ISO controller changes the amount of film granulation and dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel does not make sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2) to see. the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top-lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digicam; filter film granulator is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film granularity on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix large silver granules of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image acquires a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, streetphotographic, grainy sight especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are needed, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitized filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. natural images and still life styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better for large images. smoothing checks the smoothing or, from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel wide image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digicam; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digicam; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures a 3-D effect. it works especially well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the waveliths 1, the image is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: wipes the image along star-shaped lines from a center point. this simulates the blur a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: wipes the image by turning the pixels around the center. this simulates the blur of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement: blurred vision by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photos, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softening: blurs the image softly in the dark and strong tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamorous photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred vision by random shifting of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the paint tank in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">Raindrops are a nice little tool to make regentropfen on your picture. thus, it gives natural your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drop size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number changes the number and density of the drops. fish eyes changes the optical effect of the drop on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the & digicam; image processing to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can get it by mirroring or spinning in the right direction. you can find the tools in the Transforming turning or transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo-blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you re-invent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. to do so, change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool for blowing.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digitized; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo recovery was developed by the IMAGE Team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the New size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the original image aspect ratio will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and Upload are used exactly for this purpose. each stamping for photo can be stored as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time to pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by magnifying a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a common operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you just need to use the mouse only to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photos will be cut off. this will give you a good overview of how your photo after cutting would look like. you can change the size of the area to be clipped by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply clicking with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">When you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cutting button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or save file under the menu file to save the newly-cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog stays intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio cut, you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the higher value of the height and the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio cut uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to cut the area to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the mapping tool the next time, these settings are displayed as standard values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF data, so the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settling help settings allow you to hide help so that you can put your pictures together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonious divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in similarly harmonious triangles aligned on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division of different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built your temples and pyramids. artists and architects used the golden division in all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more liquid relief lines if you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">In comparison to the third rule, the golden spiral generates a fluid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition introduces the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow along the line.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spirals, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that draws the eye to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the gold spirals discussed above. their vertices are the centre points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals to place these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve in any other way.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror options and vertical mirror options can be used to mirror the harmonic variations.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image to any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it happens easily that you don't hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the right top.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the picture, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have shot a picture you will find undesired triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transformate cutting from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after turning. note however the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you have to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically calculated. on the right side of the dialog, you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle to the left: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is greased a little. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with Transformers cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The scoring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. this is no rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformation scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. you can rotate horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press Preferences, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the sea, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the scoring tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scoring, the image is wiped a bit. for a single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two shuttering is twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After scoring, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with a transformation from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitized; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on their system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digitized; shows only files in formats that are familiar with. this happens based on the file extension and a comparison of these with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & edited; the file in the editing pane can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you even to choose the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & edited; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compression processes on digital images. thereby, redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG for the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, please refer to Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF using the raw image converter from & digiti. in the Configuration section you can find further information about using modules with & digicam;.</seg>

<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & posters; re-calculates the graph and in & kologem;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & posters; to open or graph in & kologem; in a & quot; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading of large graphs (currently there are problems from about 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Other required software: & kgraphics viewer; is a & kde; -program which requires the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for displaying graphs. needed in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. at the beginning, if you & kgraphviewer; without launching an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar only contains the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more & dot; -files, the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphically; you can also remember your decision so that later also procedure will be used. if you want to change your decision later, you can set the menu item settings kgraphically; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a Graphite file outside a running & kgrapheme; instance, & eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice if you want to open a new & kologem _ instance or display the graphs to be loaded in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="741">When starting the program, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on one page will be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled in by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a one-page graph without headline and another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewable Download page gives you the ability to set the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or ask the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphviewer; specify when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the current session) or determine that each time is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives you the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraphviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not to the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which appears normally by clicking in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up more possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; -layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the website of & graphviz; are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directed graphs. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edge overlapping as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the default for unreadable graphs. it produces representations in accordance with the springboard model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a springboard model for undeveloped graphs. it uses the fruity-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes in a circular way according to the description of Six and Tolli, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">The command should accept the graphite file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify & eg; the & graphviz; -algorithms to change special options, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (judged or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type to (dot; for directed, & neato; for unreadable graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is checked, the overview is displayed if necessary. otherwise, it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">"" "shows the" "" "What is the" "" "mouse pointer." "" "with this mouse pointer, click on a & GUI; -element to get more help to this item (if available)." ""</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available at this address and in the file ChangeLog in the source folder of the source repository.</seg>
<seg id="759">& kgraphics viewer; is a & kde; -program which uses the & graphviz; tools to display. it requires the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special device is not necessary to use & kgraphie.com; in the Settings menu you will find more options.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main window of the icon editor is divided into five areas: the main toolbar, the bar for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid, in which you draw the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="762">Creates a new icon. if the current file has been modified, you will be asked if you want to save the changes. then a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon will be created from a template, or whether you want to start from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="763">Restores the last undo step. if you have not made a step undo, this function is downlighted.</seg>
<seg id="764">Adds the clipboard content as a new image (if clipboard contains a symbol).</seg>
<seg id="765">Set the current symbol in gray scales. this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of & kde.</seg>
<seg id="766">Does not change the icon, it sets the current character color to the color of the point you click on.</seg>
<seg id="767">The status bar shows you the current actions. from left to right, it shows you the x- and y-coordinates of the current pixel, the size of the current drawing surface, the magnifying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="768">Adds the clipboard content as a new image (if clipboard contains a symbol).</seg>
<seg id="769">With Settings & kiconedit; set up a dialog with the three pages Templates for symbols, background and symbol grids.</seg>
<seg id="770">With the buttons Add..., Edit... and Remove you can change the Templates for Standard File, Source File, Compressed File, etc.</seg>
<seg id="771">Select Transparent pixels or show rulers and set one color: or a chess board as a transparency display. you can also adjust the size of the caros for small, medium and large as well as the color 1: and color 2: select.</seg>
<seg id="772">The KIPI module provides tools to read and store new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that is supported by the Sane Project or any other source like Video Streams. for this to work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by replacing the default values ducrhe to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you scan the image with the button scan. the estimated file size will be shown in the right, lower corner. in the Kooka manual you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window will be displayed in full, as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the scan button you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the target image appears. please remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore creates very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after you have selected the menu import &gt; screen shot... a window appears where you can adjust the different screen photomodes:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program window is selected, the calling program will disappear, so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workplace. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window under the mouse will be read.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other worktops, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog box appears with the options described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI module Calendar does not currently have any documentation yet. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="785">This module will archive your albums on CD / DVD media using the K3b burning program. you can simply select the albums to be archived. an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation. the AutoPlay option is also available for Windows platforms.</seg>
<seg id="786">KIPI modules expand the program in which you are loaded to add additional functions. you can integrate additional menus, keyboard shortcuts and other skills into the program. you can install as many modules within the calling program as you want.</seg>

<seg id="795">If you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. with Flickr it is possible to send your photos to the people that are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, make photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The module exporting to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you are guided by the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. it is thus practically your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can log in to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful application, the module can send pictures to Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful application.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. to upload, you need write permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pushed once after you have set all other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press on the Ok button the upload of the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as key during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options Opens, Friends and Famillie, you can set the access rights to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose the option Change the size of the photos before upload, the photos will be changed before uploading in size. size is taken from the value registered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module Galerie-Export currently has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF-keywords of the image, and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization makes tools available to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical location Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. in order to run a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed that indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera time zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time variance is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below this, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from a place for images you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have the right data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlating to interpolation.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location. since the dialog changes the coordinates from a call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the indicated map. to do so, select the region and enlarge it. enter this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside of the KIPI module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set will be coded UTF-8 to provide the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the albums are not displayed hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Appearance tab defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the picture will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Reiter record defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. to do this, select a folder where you have write permissions. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With Other Color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, it also influences the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Rider preview images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for the thumbnails which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not automatically be closed. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred while generating. the web browser will automatically start to close the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and switchers. he was developed for quick picture display and quick access to his functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases, as no compression of color information takes place. this can be found in the PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client module is a tool for you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation yet. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then, select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied after you have pressed the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but do not write into any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please refer to exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG codec module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG codec module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a base image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG Slideshow. then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value produces very sudden, a high, very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. the name and path of the generated file can be specified under the name of the mpeg output file. keep the extension mpg as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie with the button kode. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a hint appears that coding or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button Settings on the bottom right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g.: useful to improve or print the Gimp module directly.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on Dave Coffin command-line tool. an original quote from him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file which is to be converted and run the module. the Raw Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings for the white balance are to be used. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal you can further edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected to allow you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch doesn't have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere, you should not select the JPEG format, as there is only a limited number of operations allowed before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion with the trigger button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert several images at a time. use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, they have the option to automatically overwrite existing file. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image. in addition, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can set the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images with a file selection dialog using the button Add images. for the last selected image, you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the list of images to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">The selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open the New Message window of your e-mail client by clicking OK. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you have selected are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. their configuration is stored and used every time you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments will be added to the images in a text file and enclosed by the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the sending images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so that you can view the status messages, in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Slideshow a window will appear with questions about how to show your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions option in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option shows that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner while the presentation is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="888">"" "the" "" "loop" "" "option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually interrupt it with Esc." ""</seg>
<seg id="889">The option pictures randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. thus, it is not used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the pictures the temporal distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should check this out before presenting your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select. by chance, each transition from the images chooses a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show you can access a toolbar at the top left corner of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause and restart the presentation, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">If you are interested in writing them, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The Background KIPI module is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE working surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your pictures and videos with notes, you can go with & kPhotoAlbum; through these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, you are now in any group, so in persons, places and in the group keywords are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories for which you have entered information than you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and, of course, view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse over the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images are shown on which both persons are visible. by this selection method, you can restrict the number of images shown from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images in your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same icon in front of her name. you can store with & kPhotoAlbum, but for each person you can save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images next to the name, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for each category. this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you have to specify which image to be displayed for each individual. in order to do this, you will need to open the image view window (in more detail) and in the context menu, you will have to select the image for the appropriate person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you call the Search entry in the main window, a dialog will be displayed, which is very similar to the dialog for creating the image properties. you can view this dialog once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field caption or description, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also specify a date to search for; the date may be either part of the total date, i.e., for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use an area of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can browse all images according to specific names, as you can see in the picture. here the pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene, are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kPhotoAlbum; if you don't like to read handbooks, but rather try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kPhotoAlbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kPhotoAlbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kPhotoAlbum; start the first time, or select the menu entry kPhotoAlbum; -Demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of & kPhotoAlbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print out this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & kPhotoAlbum; as a contiguous HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kPhotoAlbum, see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you data statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can change between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of that date will be displayed in the preview window) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timeline. if you select an area, you will see only images of this time period in the preview pane. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kPhotoAlbum; provides you with two ways to create HTML websites with your images. one is in & kPhotoAlbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual the in & kPhotoAlbum is described; integrated version described which you can create from the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and purpose. in the following, each section is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the review and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kPhotoAlbum; HTML example pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if a & kPhotoAlbum is to be created; -Exports file should be created on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. by doing so you can avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are displayed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this page is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. therefore, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, do not download images that have, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time that you have set. so, you can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">For all your HTML files, select a base folder and a new subfolder for each successive set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you have to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. you can choose either a folder or a KDE protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they really are all visible to the viewer. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be started after the pages have been created. otherwise, the web browser will run in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you will have to copy them there manually. so that the import function, see, properly works, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder will be created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kPhotoAlbum; together, you might want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have spent a lot of time looking at the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to do with & kPhotoAlbum; do not do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kPhotoAlbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, both internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are saved in the file, or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images into the file is that you have all the images together and that this file can be shared so independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see Create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches for the images that are located in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described which you can access via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Automatically copy option to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy to the .kim file, copy & kPhotoAlbum; the images are automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu File Export... then & kPhotoAlbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importing is made up of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category Persons of the file to be imported (if you are a Dane), while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories they are in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at images, you often want to jump inside different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your holiday in Italy and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the various steps of (1) Setting the information about your images, over (2) the browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kPhotoAlbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top of its images. this is a simple XML file that lets you back up with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kPhotoAlbum; memorize the folder in which your images are stored and use it in future starts automatically. if you want to read another database in & kPhotoAlbum, you can launch a new folder tree with pictures, you can start & kPhotoAlbum; with the -c option. as an example: kPhotoAlbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings cPhotoAlbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kPhotoAlbum; in the following section of the user manual the different settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can access by pressing a button on the F1 key and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described to you how to set different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a lettering and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog options, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kPhotoAlbum; share its modular system with other graphics applications, such as digicam and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface. please refer to the website of Kipi for more information.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the menu module. the modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of & kPhotoAlbum; however, most of the modules have a help page that you can access through the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together by multiple applications together, it can be that the modules are tested with & kPhotoAlbum; only very little tested. therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications which use the modules above KIPI are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kPhotoAlbum are not working. this is the disadvantage when you share features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kPhotoAlbum; and other applications that KIPI also use is that the other applications are simply a folder. even if & kPhotoAlbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the features with & kPhotoAlbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">It simulates & kPhotoAlbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images that show you the preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album, you have to pass a photo album; the modules also have a list of albums. here's & kPhotoAlbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kPhotoAlbum; s browser shows the contents of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category is an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category that you specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kPhotoAlbum is used; so do so, so if you would have chosen people to view it and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kPhotoAlbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the settings dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & kPhotoAlbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see a menu bar and toolbar at the top. under the toolbar, you will see the window that you can browse your image database.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kPhotoAlbum; is the ability to see any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons appearing on the image, where the image has been taken, etc. you can set any picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, is illustrated on all pictures Jesper and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by setting persons, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kPhotoAlbum; since you will always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to postpone the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people are depicted, you can find that the names used are shifted upward, the persons find and assign more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to display an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting icon by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all selected images and annotate these images with annotations. in this case simply click on the front and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple items at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to sort it into a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the annotation dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from within a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options... button, which offers among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also hide a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry of images in your browser, you will get an overview with thumbnail images of the currently selected images, or all images if you have no filter set. you can see the size of the thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">If you click on a picture, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the delete button or select Edit menu in the Edit menu. now the window will appear you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kPhotoAlbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kPhotoAlbum; you can also use the images anywhere, so that & kPhotoAlbum; you can record the images somewhere, so that & kPhotoAlbum; you can record the view of & kPhotoAlbum; if not all necessary images can be downloaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. however, for the pictures 5-9, the thumbnails are available, so that & kPhotoAlbum; you can view these images not with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy and copy files from the folders. & kPhotoAlbum; does not yet support you to insert the related CD. so, if you want to avoid trouble on how to avoid mixing your images, please buy a larger disk to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, you filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you unavailable and click on Current View from the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also use all the images that your little sister may see, control and select the menu entry Everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have set which images to be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images to be hidden. if you want to get the images displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply change password in the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">For one, all images on the hard disk and on the other hand, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection only serves those who are with & kPhotoAlbum; not very familiar to forbid the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you have all your pictures with & kPhotoAlbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to view them sometime. for this reason, & kPhotoAlbum is equipped with a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in it. of course, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have to enter over the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag them with the mouse and place somewhere else. you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information should be displayed. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. you can see the pop-up context menu below.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all images of Anne Helene. as if you have selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and after by using the image height and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. & kPhotoAlbum; then load a new image after a few seconds. how frequently it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kPhotoAlbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. just use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can drag and zoom into the image. for zooming, you can pull out a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button, you can zoom out The Plus key zooming in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the power button, you set the zooms, so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus power button.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turning functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make comments to the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten to put on the picture. in the moment you can view this and open configuration dialog of the image to enter those names. you may prefer to select only the image and look at more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad while you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in this picture, you can see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply put them all at once with annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview. if you want to view categories in dre Vorhview, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show in a picture. in this case, you will be allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to turn on the painting mode of & kPhotoAlbum; switch on the painting from the context menu. to stop the painting, just press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovray; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully master, but documentation to & Povray; should you have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the sub-object of an already selected object, as all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will appear so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under editing, or from the right mouse button context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply this Changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click on the user or discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the tag view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render only a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross in the wire model view displays. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the level of view of the higher-level object or as an absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected, or their visibility level is smaller, or equal to the level of visibility that is selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window layout as default. the object tree and the view of object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or under a current view, drag the Anfasser to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the Anfasser to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over each other, drag the Anfasser in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the index tab at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the Anfasser to the desktop or click on the small to the left pointing arrow in the toolbar.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon. the Rendering symbol in the toolbar or select the menu entry View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">Render mode matches the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview up to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select Render Modi in the View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to use a name that indicates the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the carton card size you can enter the width and height of the rowed image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality combination field, you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection light.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, several errors can arise. these images often have a Moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the display. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the impact of this error. in general, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on Anti-Aliasing, calculate and connect to Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling is the neighbouring pixels with inputs. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because every pixel is distributed again and again because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels is exceeded, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">If you are using abs (b 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further tracked and tested for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process, called jittering. if you turn on jittering, changed & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can adjust if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays hit no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file import... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command range of & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source code for & Povray; likewise.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the Property View, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. altitude field data) in the paths to & Povray; -Libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wiremodel views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects, such as the sphere, you can adjust the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross High Detailed View for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and the vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the ground, a bottom is rendered under the objects. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. please refer to the Render-Modi section for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window instructions section will explain how to create and store window arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down box standard window layout: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window order when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of window orders displays all existing window orders. you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected order with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the selected window layout. you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you get a card view view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules can be used for rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you get only one black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following preset window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this tutorial first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item Edit. thus, you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The clincher view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right bottom). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the user button or the input button, the wiremodel views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they view the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a fader (insert infinite body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the user button or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The clincher view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite end. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree closely, you will find that you can open the item for the floor when you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select Shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the ground to adjust its properties. there are many different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object. please select first subitem. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button Preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matt black material, because you still have to enter the pigment settings. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the box and bullet in the preview, just click on the user button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you have expected. in the color list, you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">"" "in the object tree select" "" "monochrome" "" "each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to execute this step already, as you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; already understood, the ball can be created just as simple as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the object properties view, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the input button or the user button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, as you have shifted the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already at the bottom, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first sub-object and change the name for example in bullet pigment. click on bullet pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chrome-plated surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you have & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the racer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the image is simply black. obviously, each scene needs to be rendered, some sources of light and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you previously made with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last modified command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have previously used edits.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new configuration or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu, you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can use this option to modify or add new short commands for & kpovmodeler; changes or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. with this option you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump Map is a way to simulate rugged surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a Bump Map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are made from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can display by clicking on the & LMBn; or the return button.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window, or if all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, simply type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a matching filename has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Enter or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command; each KDE installation should be included.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here's an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& amarok; sends messages to all running scripts. for this purpose strings will be written to the default script of the script. for this reason, scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script needs to take care of each script itself. when a script is started, Amarok places the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange indicates that a new piece is played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, more information about the new item (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths contains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user defined menu entry is clicked. submenu and itemTitle are also passed to allow the script to use dcop amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to perform tasks such as storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks Script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension amarokscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is finished, you can append it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki script side of & amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the amarok script; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & amarok; you can easily drag music into the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus. you may also search for a very specific title from thousands of items in your collection. with & amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but can never decide which you want to hear? then the playlists browser is just right for you. and if the decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. furthermore, many different audio systems can be used, so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. these and many other useful features make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right way to rediscover your music!</seg>

<seg id="1218">To keep the current piece visible while changing the piece, the playlist will pop up / roll in order to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Changing the context-browser automatically displays the context-browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can adjust & amarok; s Appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font section, you can set the use of various fonts in & amarok; by selecting own fonts, the otherwise gray displayed section will be enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows, and context browsers. click Select... so you can select a font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. so you have to install kdelibs (including the programs included, because & amarok; requires some of them to e.g. find modules or scripts). we have written a little guide how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager will hold the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause difficulties, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file using ~ / .kde / share / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, it is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, with GCC 3.4, Taglib was compiled with GCC 3.3.X, then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable it if inactive for... in the setting of the sound system, or at least do not use value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the email will automatically open for a crash). if it is a common crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta information, but do not mark them as unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARP [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARP [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = get _ v2tag; print "Error in writing the tags of $ARP [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: icon lookup error: amarokapp: _ ZN11KsystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, please check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which amarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some options. most installation problems are lightest by the help of an expert in your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for searching for help. please insert a bug there if you have something to fix a fault in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & amarok; only an empty playlist will appear. how do pieces of music come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the GUI intuitive, the start window has been converted into the Statistics window. you'll find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To review pieces, the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column view rating. click somewhere in the new application column to determine the rating for a piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa heatsink, the device has to provide a blender. a blender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously distribute audio. this can be achieved by using a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (Software Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify a different hint (e.g. shocking).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you'd just want to hear a white noise. Streamer is the best choice for most people if you're looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open sound server with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure the wrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">KDE 3.2.x issues problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this bug report. magnifying the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts driver but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Probably use the Arts driver. use another driver (the xine driver was heavily optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less dread the visualizations react. yes, this is a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but when I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, it crashes and amarok. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you will need to register all the components. follow the register register to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if this doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish Amarok before!): - Store tilmpeg, compile and install it. then, run mpeg-register, once as system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module file (you will find the module folder with the following-config / GStreamer-config) and execute the following registry again. start now & amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1366">There is a search filter right under the toolbar. it is the same in the list view as well as in the tree view.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a drop-down box, with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you have various time windows at your disposal, ranging from the last 24 hours to a year.</seg>

<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something search for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">For example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50-comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment pool.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>

<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files to the new folder:</seg>

<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -Reader for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s can be read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many coding machines that encode these WAV files. currently, lame is supported for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression). more codes can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format, or in other formats, such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggable (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, but it is not necessary to install only the packages that are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer is a small introduction to coders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device protecting the protection, it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up has to be done only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration was found), then the daily handling of reading a & CD is explained to the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; obtain information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without a network, whereby everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step for example, there are more information on how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">CDDB request of the CD data will start on request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. note that previously the encoder was configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already read file is selected to encode instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as logs, beeps) for program events (such as reading the & CD; terminated).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main entry dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (like encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression rates and helps you choose the right coding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Under the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences are less important, as both codes generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless included with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but slightly lower quality compared to OGG for lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG voting machines is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special auto-stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for additional parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good visibility for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or retrieved by the program automatically from the freedb via the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / need with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders will explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add CD; title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switch -tt from lame and the title Parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in which people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information instead of entering the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator: this is meant by the author) is not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the CD; any information that is publicly available on the & CD; and in addition, the information without the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively to choose a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only updates to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What reading program is used to store pieces from CD & CD; to store in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CDs; see note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For the first time, pre-defined lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the encoding menu. other codes can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for pre-defined codes. more information about encoder can be found in the Kodierer chapter.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a coding, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and write real on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio encoding of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc.) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; please check the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are still unsure about what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (Tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write privileges on it (eg by trying to copy it into it with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator;, something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what kind of reading & CD is to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any reading of a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, then a look into the / etc / fstab file and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">There is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information, select prompts so that you will be informed if information on generating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The Cartridge CD; Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected to the Internet so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop down box is easier, is a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or filename is changed with Konqueror &gt; renamed and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">You can use freedb locally in offline mode if you download the database previously. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selections must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb. put everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this path the load is distributed between the machines, but this setting will work first.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, since many firewalls are standardly bockdown the protocol 8880, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screen shot. (make sure the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously missing pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know it, so simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Discard CD; after reading out the last piece, tick this to the CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then the path / folder can be specified in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is somewhat long, you may need to scroll to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the achieved compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in the event of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encooperating WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we just have the basic device of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have wisely chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section we describe how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will set up and set up MP3 files. first, a connection to the internet is structured as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb will want to pick up. the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use one & CD, which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from the data obtained from freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually input data instead of retrieving them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the & CD; this example will be found. it's a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, then the CD has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then check the section Questions and Answers after the Help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successful from the freedb could be picked up, all titles of the pieces have been filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window visible and you can select the database entry that best suits your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you did not select the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on page & CD; settings in the dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but get the data from the internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the input field 'Latest Title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments in person / piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful call of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but contains already the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any undesirable comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment range. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least to what & kaudiocreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see Help coding to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the missing CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After selecting 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the row with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD Editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Caution: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown on the piece list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line will turn off the selection of the piece, or select the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process has been selected by clicking on the selection process, this window will appear to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">On the tab jobs for switching to the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the lower left part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message when you try to work with a code that you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and destination folders are not what we typed here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new record: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into MP3 format. this allows reading and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. the computer with an AMD64 does not seem to be a problem for simultaneous reading and encoding (of two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to produce compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the coding of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics of lyrics and others use both. some pieces have no lyrics at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined which uses a song, so you don't have to adjust anything manually. so if you select the Automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke text will automatically be selected, but you still have the option to change it if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the entries in the menu settings and / or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can consolidate. in this section, you will see how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the collection under the item Organizing.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then displaying the name for the new collection. at the beginning, this collection will contain the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the ad in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be saved. consider this when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. it appears again the file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the Automatically Add to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatically Add to the collection, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add-on to the collection is not activated, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. then this collection will be added to the unopened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu selection sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next song button, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the Previous Model button, the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the key arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not general MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI response translates into events synthesized by the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano into events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always makes a trumpet sound if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have one sound card, you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the necessary settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, it is necessary that each occurrence has a different text id (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap..." EnD Define Keymap "A further key map..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that a section is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that in future versions of & kmid, I can offer support for devices that are not General MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches from General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the sign sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you must not change the order and leave no row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all the sounds that this instrument need to sound with the number M. if your keyboard, for example, does not support a gun fire (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (rifle shooting), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this is meant with the term drum patch of the patch, in which each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always identical drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to indicate how tones are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as well as its presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are used mainly to map tones on the percussions channel. take a look as an example of the included key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to replace the first and second channel, simply use the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the N channel. if you use the Keymap option, the key map will be used with the name name for this channel. of course, if you use the ForcePatch option, all the events that try to change the patch on this channel will be ignored. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">For example, the ForcePatch may be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates which ratio of pitch-naming events is multiplied. if a pitch-naming event is sent with the value n, it will be converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed only. the value 4096 is used so that there are no decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a pitch-Bender Event is supposed to play a pitch with the value 4096, a tone higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards are trying to get two sounds up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu, Item MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not turn green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the channel View menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo LCD displays the speed when a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. thus the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer get a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all the files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">This is why it supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; -windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First of all, activate the Automatically Add to Collection setting. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have open a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or go (if I play a MIDI file) or go back (when I play a karaoke file), I just have to switch to the & konqueror; -windows and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, turn off the Automatically Add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.Smid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so, set the Automatically Add to the collection and open A.Ther. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play with B.MID and Cmid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue to program.</seg>

<seg id="1697">They make me really happy if you send me a postcard from your home or a MIDI- / Karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will include among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me since I might have the file.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you must compile with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. alternatively, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is displayed in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections from the bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. when you click an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / folder can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayered c and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml; the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup doesn't need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be annoying at the end animation however, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; & lt; / / / home / Koos / mum.gif; & lt; / bodyCut; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer. here, the path can be set by the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer. everything must be configured by editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc file, just like setting up the backend by mimetype. here's an example of how a 'flash' with the swfdec-mozilla module is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even insert the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">To allow the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer must be specified as service provider for the Mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages related to loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is inside & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To always take a given backend for a certain mime type (of course only if this has been determined), this must be done by manually changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc file. for example, Phonon should play all the ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either by MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo port should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playback of video equipment under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be supported.</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, different names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of creating this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introversion, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, source lsource, vcdsource and vrsource. when enabled, they begin playing the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1773">With & bibtex; works only if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; -files are necessary editors. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib; -files can naturally also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box named GrÃ ¶ nigma is used for specifying the font size. the font sizes for the main text, the nodes, etc. can be defined. the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">2. the Wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and documenting the settings. 2. the document can be written from bottom to hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ Document contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not defined at the beginning, this can also happen later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex needs to be compiled; the easiest way to do this is the use of the menu building or the button fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the document compiling is out of place, it should be searched for errors in logging. if you use quick-install it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns are supposed to have another font size. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ huge and\\ end {environment} will then allow the change of font size within the environment allocated.</seg>
<seg id="1781">Changes are enforced only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, you can add certain fonts, bold, italics, submissions, etc. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for offensive printing and is long until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a set can be displayed italic in\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">The background for writing the source code with the & latex; -markup language is now followed by a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few modifications should be made for the better readability of the document. for this, a quote, a few passages in bold and italic print and a poem can be used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, an editor view or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed (in the viewer) using File Print (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the transformation of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file was created from the & latex; source code, the conversion into desired other formats can begin with the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pretext search allows direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binaries. to do this, only Modern can be set up under Settings Kile... Tools Building is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to perform the pretext search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on pre-set search. the jump to the corresponding spot in DVI; -Viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document from & Kile; opened and jumps to the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error in using a quick-install of the & DVI file, an error may be present. if an error is present, it can be summarised in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file tells the source code in the source code. in the editor, the buttons of the LaTeX errors and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX errors can be used for sprints between the errors. the log file always indicates the line in which the error appears. in order to view the erroneous line, it must be clicked on the error in the logging and & Kile; jump to the wrong line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the respective button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the pre-set options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard can be used to quickly create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file will be created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by File New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by typing in document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ Document [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps need to be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files created. if a simple way to create a template, it should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & posters; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for and posters; can be made directly from & Kile.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To find out more & posters; and to experience its possibilities, consult Kate's manual. users of & Kile; can begin directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference that can be called over the menu LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of virtually all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the Editing Pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search for different kinds of source texts and emphasize them. for example, the & latex; commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many Wizards can include additional jump tokens. this is an own type of bookmark within the text. the menu Edit bounce marks or the corresponding keystrokes enable the jump to the next or last jump mark.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; though & posters; already excellent possibilities offered, were added in & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; include special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Heats a complete paragraph (group of lines which contain an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning closes with tables, and latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only exploitative thing in & Kile; is that the paragraphs are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">This selection also has an extended meaning, as this command also has an extended meaning, as this command also has an extended meaning (\\) and an additional asterisk (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, of course, this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & Bs; offers the keyboard root Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & Kile; offers with its own commands for a faster option.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit pick-up paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for more commands under editing environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the start of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly before the command to run the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the location of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is present before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient instructions, the overview can be lost quickly. this command completes the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups defined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curly opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">When the cursor is present before or after the curly clamp of a & tex; -group #, jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested-curly groups-brackets you can quickly lose overview of the above. this command completes the recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; -groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple reference marks are used in & Kile; the sign is used for two simple reference marks. also for the end of the guidance the character is used. & Kile; knows this case and provides two closing signs for latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of double quotes can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be turned on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">You can also use specific settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and thus German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When using Shift; Entry button for a smart line break. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a spreadsheet environment, the current line with\\\\ with an adjoining line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is smart enough to support preset & latex; - or custom environments. these can be added to Settings Kile; set up LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby all t-characters (amp;) among each other. & Kile; tries to obtain this. although this tab is unfortunately not the one added, & Kile; some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & posters; already offers a good source code completion, it was added in & Kile; for special orders (mostly for & latex;). there are three different modes. all these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings Kile... Complete settings.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment by command\\ begin {surroundings} will & kile; automatically add the command\\ end {surroundings} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When you click the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and it will be possible to enlarge the complete list. on the other hand, the list can also be smaller by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are naturally removed from the selection of a command. alternatively, from & Kile; jump-marks can also be inserted, so that an easy jump to these positions can be possible by editing features and the desired parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. you can select different list lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as wirebooks of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Command mode is not useful for completing environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to enter. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completing the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When you enter the settings mode on the menu Edit settings area, or the Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the ambient commence can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key to exit.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been completed, the environment will be automatically closed again. once and Kile; recognize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command will be executed.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of list mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>

<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word defaults on the menu editing Complete recall or the keyboard root Ctrl + Alt key, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large size receptacles are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many WÃ ¶ rters are written in a document more than once. thus, & Kile; Complete for all already written trades.</seg>

<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well-known as PDF files, but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is enabled, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; -tools can then be converted to a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To view the results of the work, you need to compile the source code. all the tools are grouped in groups in the Creating, Creating and Creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer like & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt; 2. after that, the DVI; file can be viewed in a standard viewer by Alt; 3, by Alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted to a PS file and can be viewed by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>

<seg id="1928">Specify the name of the file as the result should have. normally, the file is stored in your home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus, offend, have with & quantaplus, even possibly little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality at once and don't have to wait until someone builds the set in & quantaplus. the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; -elements.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or part, we start editing plug-ins. this opens the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows to manage all contained plug-ins and add new ones. we describe every & GUI; -element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location used & quantaplus, this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often, several individuals work in a kind of hierarchical relationship with each other. & quantaplus, supports the statement of team members and these can be configured using Shift; F7 project properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used to uniquely identify.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leader as well as subproject manager.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze + button. the currently selected member (its identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of your own identity are important with regard to news and comments. see for further information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something is going on. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later you can see how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that will insert a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the side event configuration of the Shift; F7 project settings dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list, and the address can be a team or sub-project manager. see how such conductors are set up.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">It can be selected either the comment entry from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment section followed by annotext.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes may be sent to a certain member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with nickname of the set top name of the team member, plays a role in the project: team leader sub-project leaders should be given the corresponding area or sub-project names, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around parentheses and tags are invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus, is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings are accessible via the Settings menu. here only about & quantaplus, -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up with settings Quanta... called. this dialog covers a number of pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus, regarding tags including car completion can be changed with this. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lower case of tags: large / lower case of automatically inserted tags. normal / lower case letter means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lower case of attributes: large / lower case of automatically inserted attributes. normal / lower case letter means the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, for tags for which the closing tag is optional, this immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Not include optional tags: as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish day automatically: when enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding encoding while typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. using the Default button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or in any other way than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). but this setting is checked from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not recognized. however, this setting is checked by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus, periodically creates backup copies, so that during a power failure or crash when the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as storing the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or in a separate view (or documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to look at the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default window settings to the default at the next start is useful if the user interface has been confused by changing MDI modes and / or dependencies of views. it complies with the --resetched command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages range is used to control the display of warnings through hooks of no longer inquire.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronization behaviour of the VPL- and source text view in shared mode. see the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the illustration of parser nodes in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Settings section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the tree's updating frequency can be set automatically when modifying the structure tree. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifshortcut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plugins are KPart applications from third party, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, most well known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-ins, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a booth like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "component in" "" "Read Only" "" "mode: check if the plugin is denied loading. only-read-KParts normally refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is activated, then Test & quantaplus, whether the information entered is correct. if the plugin is not available at the moment, it will be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus, from version 3.3, troubleshooting has been completely redeveloped. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available to support the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the debugger plugin selector, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus (user interface):</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger appears. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger anything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if required, or it tells the plugin to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that in the normal case it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session starts the session. closes the connection to debugger or terminates listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens, while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started before a debugger requirement has been started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution will proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there were no current ones.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered, or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work of Keith Isdale and this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works of Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you & quantaplus, can help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to provide support for brand and script languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes out & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two ways, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two parts, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag Folder contains two file types, the & descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic-oriented keys of image buttons (above the editing pane), which insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the file descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, den & openptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag Folder is nothing but folder. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag Folders bear the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of an TagXML document. it can only happen once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but one element of itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for class type class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for Type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only happen once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags describing how to display this attribute, etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus, is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name inside & quantaplus, is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that assembles the elements of a list. it can only happen once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the attribute text position within a dialog. this tag allows for each attribute in a dialog only once (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces don't affect anything, but be aware of & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsThis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; will not cause a break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog appears at the top of the & quantaplus, window to start and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear, its simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not available yet. currently, checking is done only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following one example for a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for accessible via DTD processing DTD settings. with this, diedescriptionrc; for a list selectable & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Use 1 for & quantaplus, version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set actions with Settings... created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut is assigned to this action. by clicking on the user-defined button a shortcut can be assigned, with Kone the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when the action is executed, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use as input (or parts of the document).</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. This way: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus. if by & quantaplus, only one instance is running, the text unique is added to the PID number. this is useful when using DCOP for controlling & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods mentioned above, a script can be input from & quantaplus. in the input field, input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, to the standard output. it can be specified, which should be done with the text written on the standard output, by setting the value of the output box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">When there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in any given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the brand.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all necessary fields and add the tag to the suitable toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, in case the tag has attributes and you are planning to use them, enable "Edit Tag" dialog if available, so an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the menu;, Graph More programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will usually be as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled that clicking on this icon will include & lt; startgt; -tag will be inserted in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be connected to the action. this is done through the menu with settings actions set... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so there are more, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions for toolbars or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar to set dialog on toolbars. make sure the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the Trenner support the grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -Button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all symbols to make sure everything is working.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After NeeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your file descriptionrc so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable enlargement of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to search for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you have to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in main index Top Element = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.3.html... [Context] ContextList = Section1.html tag1 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. it indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the shaft (except by reason) mdash; but try it out for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will appear!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces don't affect anything, but make sure & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources files.</seg>
<seg id="2066">For example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of text-separated context elements that are to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc, after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. they won't be rich, but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different locations there is an e-mail menu entry, like DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, toolbar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the others and quantaplus. the contributions are reviewed and only made available when our team considers them as correct and useful for publication. in order to make a possible contribution, we recommend that resources be signed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New resource dialog, you need to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and start uploading by clicking OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bars, and start the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, still before installation, investigate & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message appears indicating the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages currently not yet supported by & quantaplus. however, creation can be time-consuming, because hundreds of tag files in tagXML format might be necessary. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the menu DTD Load and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination Name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">Doctype definition line: the string that appears in! doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the file descriptionrc; -editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand them and to take full advantage of & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are stored for everyone named & quantaplus. from toolbars to actions everything is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus, -MDI; consists of several main areas: the Editor window, the construction view, the tab with information and the toolbars. please insert in, and for more detailed information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab in the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document entries, such as closing the current, other or all tab, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area lead to another context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste), edit the text under the mouse cursor or open the file if the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & Quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is displayed. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a tag, e.g. & lt; insert in your document, then click on the tag that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (like anchors), you can fill in different fields in a dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building manners (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus, to open and roam them. in the presentation with learning flashers are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides you with a powerful tool. this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administrator to manage files in the project by right mouseclick. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage media can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus, is the use of templates. almost anything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are available only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of the integration in Global, Lokal and Project works also here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one displays the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it you can change attributes and namespaces. the application system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development to find. it can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus, 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project specific documentation can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus, two tab at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; scripts which are executed give all error messages (so there are some) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate bar of the toolbars is the ability to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus, is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus, sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar Archive by & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the configure script. to do this autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting from & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is in front of your bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus, is a web development tool for the KDE desktop. & quantaplus, was optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus, an independent, expandable markup-language editor? well, this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus, follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why develop, what already someone else developed? thanks to the & kde; -scaffolding is not only this everything possible, but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus, enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task possible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the details of the documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or helpdesk help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you attempt to save selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when pasting from clipboard there contained special characters to & HTML; -Description, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from clipboard in & URL; -Description, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">This allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script passes error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of script files and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Exit and switch on the problem-porter at the bottom of the & quantaplus, main window. the problem reporter is activated once you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder, and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Downloads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; from and if you have downloaded other input / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, which manages the project. in chapter & quantaplus, you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project files / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. that only creates the name. actions must be saved by setting actions... to be added. toolbars are saved by toolbars tool bars or you are asked when you exit whether you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download one & DTD;, you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus, your own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be rised without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no writing entitlement in the global KDE file, the load will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded tool bars. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar in the Tags menu.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus, the insertion by means of toolbar denies if this day responds to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugins menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the menu points listed above. click on it. click on an activated plug-in deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available emphasis schemata depends on the type; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected & DTD; by using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching sometimes may take time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaplus, 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting a entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar display at the bottom of the & quantaplus (main window).</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Establishes the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer, but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus, is a high-quality product that is freely available and free licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus, development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be completed best from top to bottom, as, for example, the entire directory structure for the rest of the project is completed automatically for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus. project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.g..de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. if you have failed scripts (e.g., PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let it be checked if files located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started anew from scratch, no hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new Project Assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu item project properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or altered using the Shift; F7 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders available) that are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">In addition to the above, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the profiles uploading, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile, by showing their own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow one can turn on event actions and add, modify or delete these actions. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as the backup of a file.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default opens & quantaplus, the last project that was open. you cannot influence this behavior at this time.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the project menu or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the opening and opening entries are missing... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button is blinded to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to Programming. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk store option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many upload profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files are to be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & ftp;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so that it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can give a lot of views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the Project or Project Toolbar, accessible via the toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows adjusting & quantaplus, to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are the best tool for toolbars. use and addition differ. adding toolbars is treated below in the addition of toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols on it can be set either by context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a New toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, tool bar rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be entered into the dialog, where it can be specified, which actions on these or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action edited which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings toolbars... and set settings to set actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus, uses templates basically like a common filesystem with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus, supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set out at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. more information about the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents are nested in corresponding subfolders. you make a simple scaffolding for the purpose and organize the work in a corresponding way in order to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can contain everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for entire web sites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File as Template Save As Local Template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has happened, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File as template save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for this, for example drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project file tree view, you can click on a folder to the right and create site template, enter a name for the template, and secure it. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can also be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very target-oriented approach. you can pre-enter headers and footers or dynamically link with & PHP; design, insert files or link with them. additionally, you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files laid in $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder with the right mouse button and select properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is blinded as soon as parental attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set, it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows predefined or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project, and allows to copy content templates into a folder with special headers / footers a whole presentation already with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus, offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & Source editor, which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second one splits the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to source code editor, in which the implemented changes in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the absence of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; editor and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is already active, this mode is already active, the keystroke pushes the active cursor from one window to another, where the position in the document is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source code editor can be adjusted via settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation is: a small span for fast calculators and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows the change of content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons under the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported yet.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS stylesheet by pressing the file-open button and selecting the corresponding file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Using the cursor is possible as in a text processing, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted through typing and deleted using the button or distance button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way through the toolbar, as in the source code editor. note that inserting tags before already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars like the table assistant or the Listen-assist are deactivated. they will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists need to be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the examination of style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the performance of the style template can be followed.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To be able to compile successfully, except & kde; libraries libxslt, libexslt and LibXML, which are already present in a typical installation of & kde.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Stop in a template, at a place loaded in a style or xml file loaded by xsldbg or at the current node. new in xsldbg 3.1.4: orphaned retaining points can be set in a certain file and line number and later activated.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg determines the full path from a filename without path name. filenames in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the working folder con xsldbg Is, for example, a style template file.. / en / xsldoc.xsl, the following entry is possible:</seg>
<seg id="2231">In this command, a partial or entire agreement with a template named QNAP or a specified mode name is checked. & eg; template is consistent with any myQNAPcloud containing the template.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Each namespace in the specified "QNAP" is extended by the rules defined by the namespace defined in the XSL source file; xsl: test1 is & eg; extended to http: / / www.w3.org / 199 / XSL / Transform: test1</seg>
<seg id="2233">A requested fixing point must be resolved for the associated URI and line number. this is performed automatically when loading the first template by xsldbg. retaining points are re-checked shortly after the start of each iteration.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparing. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the modified lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it into one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time display the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you comparing and merging complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folders merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal and the other differs in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are located in different folders, you can make the typing work easier by using only the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3 Folder 3</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows manual typing of filenames, selecting from the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. open dialog traces your selection and shows them next time. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences is done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">On the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders will be initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C however a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. in the open dialog, you do not have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains several similar features. if you want to figure out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort. you'd just need to create two corresponding files, load them into & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; pull out only the dropping of text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B, C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Each info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B, and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed using the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees in the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. this is well visible in the next section (merge).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the pre-processor and in a few rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line breaks are activated, the line of broken lines is shown.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison window) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [changes] if you edited the result. usually, it contains text already, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons for the next resolved / unresolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group would otherwise not be visible.) This group will then be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left will appear a black bar.</seg>
<seg id="2312">This is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe again choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a selection that you may copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources, ignoring the options or activating Ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating is mainly done with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, page from, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl End, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the default window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the insertion button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the merge and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-picture upward / Ctrl image downward) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict. therefore, conflicts between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking to the clipboard, you need to press the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if this is enabled, whatever you mark will automatically be copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is no longer necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + newlines\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line end of the source files, so you should not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically at the end and restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides typefaces with variable width to choose, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the selected font doesn't support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered gerastert. on these systems, the button Preferences automatically create an unmodified color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tabulator key. otherwise, a tabulator character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press Enter or Return, the input of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files & kdiff3, first, all fully identical lines will be found in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white characters are not ignored. even when merging, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a car character\\ r 'and a newline'\ 'at the end of one line, while others store only one newline character'\ '. if this option is checked, the carriage return character may look identical, however, as a white sign is treated. during merging, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">This option is disabled in default. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Looking intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the auto-skip mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">(default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are covered in the section on the scanning of folders and executing a merger. check for details under documentation for comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapts the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you must & kdiff3; quit and restart so that the change is active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">A brief indication of the local code is displayed above the selection fields for encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Modify the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding to use for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option, you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessor commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch off this to suppress emphasis of changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files will be displayed. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply complete the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison window side by side or over each other. this can also be useful for displaying lengthy lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as preset names for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your requirements. you can use this function, for example, to cut out annoying parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this remote command. if a regular preprocessor command was specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessor command. the output of the command is only used for line interval. you can write your own pre-processor that exactly meets your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program that themselves. however, good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command command for line sequences to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). now, a pre-processing command for newlines is needed: SED's /\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for newlines. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several translations at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / Erratio / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs some details otherwise. where used\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor will be maintained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge whole folders recursively with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... simulates merging and displays the simulated changes without actually performing them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, then folder 3 is used as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folders, you will be informed of a small message box about current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan will be displayed in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or by double-clicking on the object, or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the folder menu contains two functions All sub-directories can be opened and all sub-directories can be opened with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the comparison window will be started and a comparison window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflect the type of file in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge operation cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries varies.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. with folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later, when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, erase the target if it exists)</seg>

<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after merging copies & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option to merge the new file instead of merge, then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying. if the files are different but the same date, an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file is executed after the other. it status column displays finished when merging has been successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected happens. when merging is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is chosen Full Analysis, KDiff3 will display more columns. these contain the number of unresolved, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odd), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified destination folder, then in the three folder merging mode C, B is used as the target, and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped through certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merging / continue in the list menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merging actions through conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates the flawed elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window appears with the Browse, Simulate and Cancel options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select another directory entry / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you continue to merge (F7 key), a message and detailed status information will appear. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to try again or skip the problematic entry. thus, you have the option of selecting another action for the entry or solving the problem in a different way before proceeding with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, remember & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and do not merge them again in the subsequent compilation of all entries. even if the merge operation was skipped or not saved, these entries will be merged again. only if you change the merge operation, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set menu settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the Elementbaum procedure. separate the pattern with a semicolon; (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is * .Folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element-tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element-tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted to a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other filesystems, a previous points. a file is labeled as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element-tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is disabled, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the links like normal folders are treated and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; if the option is turned on, a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to a loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Executes a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower, when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to familiar to the modification date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal in size. this can, for example, be useful when copying the modification date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activate the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the merge suggestions are selected to merge both folders. the results of merging files will also be stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file will be proposed as action. (this is considered unsafe because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not been modified.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal merge of single files, not only the merge of entire folders. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the merge view remains visible to merge individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the directory and text window to the main window in the window menu and switch between the directory and text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also directly combine a single file directly without having to run the folder. to do so, you can merge a single file directly without having to run the folder together. to do so, use the current file merging from the merge menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be saved and the file will not be merged once you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency using KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has another syntax as local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change dates. therefore, permissions or change dates deviate from the original. (note the option Confiant of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference in viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally required & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is used as a KPart, then decreases & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. then at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KIN mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it is compact) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that merging can be like the diff3 program from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot while I've looked into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or will go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure will install in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical, but if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines appear to each other, this is more than this is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">It is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source text and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was too big so far. you can always recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text should be used another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; No src left; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does this mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use a different editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">You can find a list of recent changes under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kde3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir provides the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have any problems with compiling. if difficulties still occur, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift Remove) copied to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift insert) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the folder with the Update feature.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files are not copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will likely change in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the labeling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the results window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. underlines in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces, change their size, stop them or move them. this works both within one desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual worktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible in both worktops as well as on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only has the two entries Pager set up... and exit. if, however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries will appear:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the pager; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is selected, in & Kpager, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager display; the numbers of virtual working areas display. if it is intersected with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is selected, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in & pager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is selected, the running programs are shown as small windows in the pager; otherwise only the empty workspaces will be displayed to allow them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the order of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classic lets & Kpager; in a 2xN-grid, as shown from pager applications in some other Windows managers; horizontally displays all virtual working areas in horizontal and vertical right in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini-program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, which can display and move the windows as symbols or with their content.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Cpager; and set up switch to set switch... allows the dialog settings to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the dialog box. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerc with any text editor, such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have any write permission for the file, you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you need a functioning installation of the KDE basic package.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly being extended with new functions. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you & Kmag; start, a window appears as pictured above. the main window of & Kmag displays the enlarged area of the screen. the image shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting increases & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer is like a mobile loupe. alternatively, you can & Kmag; set up a select screen area in the magnifying window (select window mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; at the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer. please note, that & Kmag; currently not able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; -pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the content of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the Shift + Shift key, or use the & MMB, you can move the drop down window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it into a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts / stops the update of the ad. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouseclick as soon as the mouse cursor remains at the same place for a while. it is meant to help people who suffer from the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and can emulate pain every mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. suffering from pain related to the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool helps to avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse, and as with all ergonomic aids: the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, make & kmousetool; pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before letting the mouse button run out. in this way, you can drag the pull with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shifting requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time has to pass after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click runs out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">When Intelligently is switched on, the rotation-field is active (1 / 10 s) active. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after clicking the mouse button, wait before it release the mouse button again, if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the Rider General. there's a slide control sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>

<seg id="2508">Set all settings back to the values set when the dialog is opened. if you have already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the smart move should be switched off at first. if you are used to the automatic mouse click, you can later lose the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to reduce sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. it's usually pretty simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take out the mouse ball. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. it should be clear, however, if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can scrape the dirt and the dirt easily with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if just a move is started. if you use the smart move in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer end by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you execute a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor wherever you want it. but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to have a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent slide, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can deal with it. it is very possible to mark text, copy it to the clipboard and execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, it will likely cause them problems. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Don't use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; to use. select a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will each time when & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the move-time starts when the smart move is moving. later, you can use the intelligent slide without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">In order to use & kmousetool; the XTest extension for & X Window needs to be installed. this should be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are properly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is short. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and who are causing pain to numb the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drawing process to start before the mouse button is released. in this way, the drag and drop can also be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Filters are processed in filters before being sent to the speech dispenser program. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace wrong spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the working of filters, it is important to know how the "speech dispenser" program works with a text.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps them in place. if the output of the screen reader is read, the queued orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you can read a long text on a website, you can welcome with & kmouth; Notifications are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you send from the card card orders is a text assignment. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the issuance of longer texts, which do not have any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of Screen-Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just reading such a screen, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to screen readers output. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there are even more types of filters available.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text. you can either specify the parts to be replaced, either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is delivered with predefined string substitution filters, which allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for the conversion of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -converters use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert from one format to another format. in the scope of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters you can send orders to a speaker depending on the content of the text or on the program that has sent the text to & ktts. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card-card speaker, you can read the text of KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it passes the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; -notification to & ktts is sent, it is processed by all activated filters installed on the page below. processing by filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2638">For setting string replacement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be replaced with the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can select this name as you like, it just has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Ercompose. the list is processed in the shown order from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs will get you with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; -numbers you have to leave. if for example & qdbus; the application ID kopete-3432 indicates, you may only type kopete.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Filters when matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions can be found in the package kdeutils.</seg>

<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone to enable Sable at all. you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages. also make sure the program xsltproc is installed and can be found via the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation marks appear to cause errors in synthesizers, so that whole sentences are skipped or just chewing flange is spent. what can I do about it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First of all, make sure the sign encoding option is set to the correct language value. if there are problems with certain characters or words, these may be fixed by a string replacement filter.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The "speech dispenser" program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktts; to use another synthesizer, contact the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSml and for the & XML; conversion filter is not absolutely necessary. Debian users can install xsltproc with the command apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later) including package kdelibs and development files for the "speech Dispatcher" program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Translate and install the source code from & ktts; you can download and install the program with the following commands from the source code archive for kdebug or downloaded tarball each night:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts, make sure that speech-dispatcher works properly with your speech synthesizer. you can use the shell script spd-conf to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program kttmsgr will be developed in such a way that the set-up of speech dispensers is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into single sentences. the user can leave statute or paragraph style, repeat, pause or break the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to & ktts, it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female, it will be used automatically the best suitable speaker. if you want to know more about how & ktts; select a speaker, see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click Add Player to Add a speaker to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the Cartridge Speaker Setup will be displayed. as an example, the device of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below.</seg>

<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is handed over to the festival. for voices, which are & ktts; known, this setting is automatically done. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak are using ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these slider lets you adjust volume, speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some controller and displayed this grey, the voice you choose doesn't allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices need to be loaded several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that the first set is synthesized faster (with higher memory consumption).</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click on the user).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window ktmgr will be displayed in the program window at the start of the program window. otherwise, only the symbol ktmgr will be visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text assignment is interrupted by a message with higher priority. & ktts; processed four types of language entries:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps them in place. once the screen reader's output has been read, the queued orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages have the next priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you are & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can with & cmouth; still welcome anyone entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning, or output of a screen reader, add & ktts; the audio output in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is played whenever a normal text order is interrupted. if both the sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound is played before the incoming message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are valid only for normal text orders. there are no special actions for messages, warnings and the expense of screen readers if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard for marking text for voice output. this standard contains stamps for the control of voices, voice speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations exist:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the default voice, the festival used in the issue of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch are not set to 100% in the festival configuration dialog, SSml text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and statute recognition filters (SDB filters). SBDs can begin to subdivide text into single sentences, since only the first set needs to be synthesized, not the whole text assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the statute recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set limits recognition filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add more set limits filters, but beginners will get off.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to do this is to test the selection of speakers. turn on the selection of speakers and select text for reading. switch the speaker selection again, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker changes. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start reading faster, since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or stop text orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal statute recognition filter is automatically set up when you start ktmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only be removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set boundaries recognition filter compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) at the set boundaries (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set identifier filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (notifications), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from mistake the normal statute recognition filter, you can insert it again by loading the contained in & ktts; contained file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card select menu, you can overwrite the subscriber settings for the application. the card card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top of the card speaker). in other words, no speaker features are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of an equipped speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; this speaker. otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best matches the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"" "select the method to enter the desired speaker features by clicking on one of the selection buttons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the speaker you want. if this feature doesn't matter, don't enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property should have precedence over other properties. you can also place multiple marks here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language lies ahead if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the default Speaker button and then use on speakers that will most likely match the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 is for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a job number. (without the order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I do not have any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is the start register-0.8. if the problem is not solved by this, a non compatible version of GStreamer is installed. you may try to upgrade or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. for this to work, the program needs to be installed sox and be discoverable by the environment variable PATH. some synthesizer modules like Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed on the card interface for speaker systems. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSml.) Deactivate the filter for conversion of & HTML; after & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSml reformerfilter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>

<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installing the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install in a & konsole; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, you can use a graphical interface like kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile, and knetwork.conf; the following commands should do so.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, in the second section all of & knetworkconf; modifiable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being used with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to run through in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is to be assigned. in foreign networks, on & eg; the network administrator can use the address that matches a valid IP address or, if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address can not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specifically reserved area for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting up a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are mostly used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own computer). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf are located and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is another content than specified in case of active DSL connections.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a security program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first thing was to create a surface for tar, which also provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be used by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; ult the tape back and read the preload information of the tape. recognize & kdat; don't know the preload on the tape, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the preload, searches for the right index on your disk. if this is not found, you will be asked if the band index is to be rewritten.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by opening the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the strap, the integration must first be resolved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize, that the integration for the tape was loosened and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not correspond to formatting with & kdat; it must be formatted before using the tape. floppy disk drives usually require formatting the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, & kdat; with the formatting of the strap continues. all data on the tape is lost! after finishing the formatting process, the tape is automatically included and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only save this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a checkbox. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Rightclick the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the dialog opens up settings for fuse. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for the backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the dialog box appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it will only check the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a checkbox. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu item Verify....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkout process has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for review.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that are to be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry. only the selected file or subfolder will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a checkbox. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to re-create the band indexfile based on the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in the same file system are backed up, such as the folder. folders that lie on other filesystems can be stored separately from backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file from tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & lt; & lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">Settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmitted and kdat; before the tape is mounted, the command mt load to the drive. on some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; to lock the ejection during the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">When the option is enabled, the tape will automatically disconnect and disconnect it. do not use this option with floppy spreaders.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; to change the hardware block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. whether this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case, tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape format, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where hostname is the complete name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; -Viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system has stored the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore, try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - to open. if you don't see them, and it opens instead a small message window, you have & ksystemlog; most probably do not have system administrator privileges.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar in order to filter by a selected criterion or after entered strings. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter will be displayed automatically, so that only log lines will be displayed. then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is contained in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">Of course, you can also select another entry. the string of the filter search term will then be matched only with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system log, select the column process, and carry in the filter bar the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a more eye-catching color as a step message. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setting dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command, such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bars.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own web page on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you will find more up-to-date information about the source sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can be found in the following folder:\ kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and also named in the following) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init develops rapidly to the standard for the control of the program start when the system is booting in the Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The sysv init also differs from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service you want to start when you start the system or when you switch to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is started only once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a serial port in / etc / rc.d.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for the program init at different places and starts the first one.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is in / etc / inittab. in the beginning section you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably realize that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change something, then you can fix it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? simple: each script is written so that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K contains, the script is called up with the argument. if it contains an S, the script will be called up with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level that only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user running level, which & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on that level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runlevels or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them to a new area. to merely copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target range -- even if the same entry already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired running level with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the Tabulator button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be recovered by & ksysv; then changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runlevels, and now the machine starts to restart. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE or Delix (DLD), you must edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using any other distribution, please check if all configuration files are available that are required by the respective system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply terminated if their configuration files are not present or configured incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaption of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you make any changes, you must save it. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog for user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you activate space restrictions (quota) for users will be created with a card card on which you can make individual settings.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The tab card management appears if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD universes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one integrated filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current filesystem is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map card groups inform about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Primary School field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add user or group from the menu, or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group functions analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boat manager, add, remove and change boot passwort, change the time to boot the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
