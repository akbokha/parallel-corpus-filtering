although I had visited the United States since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and pursued his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who wanted to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magnet with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was trapped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona was only strengthening my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very sentim@@ ental love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never thinks behind the mountain with his opinion , as one says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number obtained by the party nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deep faith person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
even Tr@@ ump Welt@@ anschau@@ ung did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
s@@ ling@@ ing intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights for her life long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still adap@@ ts to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , which always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to arrange the people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those looking different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B . : &quot; white against all other ethnic groups &quot; ; pu@@ n from white in all@@ usion to the Wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much as the big Van Jones , has killed exactly what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this land chose as its President , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later , it was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump Land , the message said .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through tr@@ ash
the Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra from C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province have in common with the children of the Par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played in both places not only has changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now the La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome poverty with its musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ al violence .
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always laugh with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the hu@@ stle and play day for day trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Wa@@ ste
more than 7.@@ 000 km south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located on top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material :
music with re@@ worked instruments made from local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er led by Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez to transform parts of decay into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were produced from garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage . the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed as Fa@@ vio something he had never seen before : a violin made out of waste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of re@@ manufactured material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world produces about one billion tons of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra performed its music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats illegal illegal fishing .
this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that pur@@ pos@@ efully reports about international , practical solutions for environmental issues .
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
in West Africa , it was known back then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the waters of the Liber@@ ian waters before the other coast of Africa was looking for .
the East African countries were so upset about this and little inclined to welcome a Crus@@ her of this kind at its coasts .
in Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not possible for him to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia , because of pil@@ lage of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 was founded by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to detect . therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance by inten@@ tional dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries circulating , the actions nowadays happen in real time , with trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ ds the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such suspi@@ cious driving routes can be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
in the ideal case , such examinations can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing may then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an advisory firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the aforementioned platform was created to recover estimated $ 20 million in lost revenues , which the eight members of H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network each year lose due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa is one of the most productive tuna fisheries that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of fantasy names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ critically organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must@@ n &apos;t walk my harbor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now .
the closed front has so far been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspect vessels .
it has revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across vast distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

the Fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps track down the illegal vessels that love to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships shut@@ down their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is designed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find inter@@ acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform in collaboration with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Environment Agency : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed across the globe by means of the vessel &apos;s position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ ain criminals but also deter them .
ships which had been f@@ ished without license and had little to face with consequences now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now reported a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets on board where they were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become an object of study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries have joined forces for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; With security , the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state of Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October , it introduced Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 is a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special , collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition .
her articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; re@@ covering the country &quot;
the movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .
this picture of Mar@@ Ã­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government rejected the application of opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by relying on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the return of Venezuela ) images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including the Bar@@ inas low@@ land area , in the An@@ des MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central north @-@ lying Bun@@ de@@ staat , Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is continually worsen@@ ing , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , which includes inflation and violence rates to the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual statement ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment for many was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( approximately : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to join the National Assembly on October 27 .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war and on 3 November all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recovery of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cried the Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter there are pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of repression and ill @-@ treatment .
especially big waves sm@@ elled the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government according to their own testimony .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a don &apos;t wear coats , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts don &apos;t have !
meanwhile an info@@ graphic already accounts for the amount of repression per day :
in this way , the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment procedure , which has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innum@@ erable people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your im@@ pe@@ ach@@ ment !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to witness the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
now grown up , Qui@@ j@@ ano has now spoken against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba .
in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
he started wearing the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
at that time , I believed that this was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not recognize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ er . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who before a federal court pronounced against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have become friends with one of the ERP .
take care not to kid@@ nap you one day and I &apos;ll have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
therefore he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine , because so my father had educated me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - everything was possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ rack where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went in and saw a couch where men were tor@@ tured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she looked like a cot and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied there .
they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , flooded it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a fil@@ thy wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that one person can harm another so much ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were tied and tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay with the face down@@ wards - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ded sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero crashed and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors listed by survivors , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , was sentenced to death for the students of Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you entered here is also the way the kidn@@ apped came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the det@@ ain@@ ees were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was at the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military in@@ signia that one takes off an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not war spo@@ ils , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal my cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , hit me and cried :
when you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anybody else to do that !
so was my father .
I have no single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a rolled @-@ collar @-@ jum@@ per made of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ no@@ isse@@ ur of this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me a burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
it evol@@ ves further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but for what purpose the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
why kid@@ nap your children ?
one day , my father brought a girl back home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families to whom they could hand over their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ inable act one can do to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something remains always .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed humans ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father originated during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I saw how you killed humans !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then tell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I delivered the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a criminal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can repro@@ ach me that I am bi@@ ased . I have finally said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 criminal off@@ enses , including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases , and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 , against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 civilians were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases the court sentences life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the first 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Perm Jud@@ gment : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ fame terrorism
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian workers .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court judgement is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on fair@@ ness for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the Argent@@ ine organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship :
the process took more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial site , which is now being run by human rights organisations .

translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO a &quot; fear@@ ful drive &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was dissemin@@ ated in social media .
adaptation of the original pictures by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Kyoto Japanese city , customers of a newly opened center in which one can pro@@ long their driving license , witnessed a particularly mis@@ used translation in the last month .
on a sign , the Japanese word ( kor@@ o@@ below sha ) , which means &quot; older drivers , &quot; wrong@@ ly - but perhaps also with malicious back thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 , was translated as &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong English translation was first removed . the name &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents across the country is quite a cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , equivalent to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen overall , the proportion of accidents caused by the elderly has risen during the same period .
the named Re@@ porter brought comments to the light in the version of the article , which was published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to be against older drivers :
among other things , the article on Yahoo about translation errors received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How fla@@ wed is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo by fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the belief that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost @-@ finding or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who have no foreign employees themselves , still allow translations to be produced internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ose and en@@ ig@@ matic pro@@ positions that arise from machine translation show that this technique cannot be replaced by a human interpreter for a long time . this applies to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English wor@@ dings in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry , but by large companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , more accurate translations can be expected .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source of its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship in the internet and television
&quot; &quot; &quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( free surfing ) of IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the Internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online tran@@ smit@@ ters also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that oppose Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro &apos;s government .
the protests commen@@ ced at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the link was sn@@ apped and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the @ vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net page .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels I have registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels .
earlier investigations by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond correctly to certain domains .
if an Internet site is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies incor@@ rectly or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNA barrier : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ locked channel , the transmission was suspended on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , was arrested .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on air again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay a lot of girls become slaves to receive education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas which were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices courtesy of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , &quot; falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her university degree at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay there is the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a big family with little money transfers their minor son or their under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child gets food , an apprenticeship and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to spend countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude being ino@@ cul@@ ated by the Cri@@ adi@@ tas would generally not be silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , which is their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family that assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies their exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of severe be@@ atings . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was the home of the former military master Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt ( Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt ) .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra beat Mar@@ Ã­n with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society , responsible for the girl &apos;s death .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest rally and demanded that there be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; says Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a quick investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n may be trend @-@ setting - for the first time in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an history a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go will come to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to declare bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to go all work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers .
for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the sooner it was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to go hungry , but she didn &apos;t have unlimited food . &quot; I could fetch more books from the master &apos;s library than food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read edi@@ t@@ orials from the opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to have no faith in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; again . &quot; so they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of the Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , would once again speak their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .
their masters feared that they would lose the education they had made it possible , &quot; she explains .
but she was fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ minated against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment where Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , during the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt especially clear that I belonged to no group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atric girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the hear@@ tland who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the authors switched to the display again :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .

bill rules Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , altered by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently agreed to draft a bill on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regulation on the use and utilisation of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established , which is mand@@ ated to give citizens permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of acceptance of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity card numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or fin@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill consists of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video axes and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration . unclear is also how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Techni@@ cian &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , based in Deutsch &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they control violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a trial process .
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees prior to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in the Parliament in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ised and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal pen@@ al against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life sentence for those destined to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest against protests . &quot;
how a Kurdish nature conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq @-@ drawn war

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . this article is published as part of a content sharing agreement .
high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an Region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activists H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the bigger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Per@@ si@@ can Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus Sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . they are endangered because of po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they always find less loo@@ t .
why is this certain kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the per@@ sian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on the fact that a big predat@@ or is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately wants to show another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs by Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to establishing protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an Region .

early March 2017 documented the progress made for the nor@@ theastern Japan daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; three @-@ fold catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a real pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had destroyed entire coastal towns from the map .
in addition , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma experienced a nuclear accident , already alone therefore 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local perspective which progress has been achieved six years after , in order to rebuild the lives of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as pol@@ l results of the affected persons themselves .
the housing development in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of planned spare @-@ homes ( date @-@ cent@@ red @-@ time , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of planned spare @-@ homes were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 per cent .
at the same time , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of temporary shel@@ ters ( date of production , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is still to be reloc@@ ated into final spare @-@ homes .
after the three @-@ times catastrophe almost 80@@ ,000 people saw themselves forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36@@ ,000 people living in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in this area . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who were hau@@ ling after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led in final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o paper could determine , 1,@@ 0@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the fact that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident were affected extensively in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , whereby only 66 per cent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farm@@ land can be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear bor@@ der@@ line . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has recovered largely again , but here , too , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far away .
the number of tourists in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to measure an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation districts . it asked them about the status of the reconstruction and also how their perception changes over the ts@@ un@@ ami risks .
in her introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done .
how it is for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ o@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
almost 63 000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement houses .
after the status of 2017 there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation districts are older than 50 years old . it is known to have to be returned to real dwell@@ ings because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the common ground .
after a while , however , one often real@@ ises that one more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in an artificial coma after being beaten up by police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had struck him with a strike against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a head@@ stock . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ ana with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would thus be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ ol@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a media campaig@@ ner from Go@@ i@@ ana , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs soon rush to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been split multiple times into social networks .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Loc@@ ell@@ ado is calling for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ er@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , only to crimin@@ alise the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who has struck him with a head@@ stock .
police en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which there was brutal police action on demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police brut@@ ally placed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a platform for speakers .
the MP , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to rel@@ inqu@@ ish violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , Brazilian media have covered road protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo especially reported on a broken glass window in order to be illustr@@ ative with a photo of their front pages .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a set @-@ up bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than over the protests of thousands of people who are serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognized if one is strictly against any form of material damage .
here too the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alization of Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
after succ@@ eeding , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and commu@@ te daily to factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stands every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that are back in operation after a long in@@ active time , because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the volume produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the Report &quot; Agricultural Outlook &quot; published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization .
if current production reached the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would produce around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will come into history with certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane plant Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he frequently repe@@ ats is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents said the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first closing year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents which differ@@ ed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ mer Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was over@@ shad@@ owed and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation , &quot; he affir@@ ms .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the creation of the factory in which he helped build .
with every part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ sheet metal producer has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the work stations and services they were generating in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of October 21 , 2002 , the President of that time saw in the eyes of the present persons when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly through gr@@ ind .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ credit them , they also ceased to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , which also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a perspective , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
forty @-@ nine harvest the old soldier a rent of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies that were told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .

first Nations te@@ ens use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
shooting a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an .
young people in the First Nations community all over Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it by Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos; we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and working in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop thus increases that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the State of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribal of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called highway of tears , a section of road in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people do not always speak the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a stop@@ per in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in writing , as well a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to keep my days on earth
this is the day when you will take our scre@@ am
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and lead to our youth
so they can do what the Creator has destined for .
in the comments section , the reader and champion of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and reis@@ su@@ ed here with approval ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( hot , hot , hot ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , they are displayed near the entrance of the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the so called &quot; artificial models of the courts &quot; ) of any food served in this restaurant .
the customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and then decide whether they are entering the restaurant or going on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
there are a multitude of these small companies in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , who produce those plastic dishes that the German film maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning it into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
in Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a number of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile belts decorated with plastic dishes , as shown at the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few sho@@ ck@@ oo fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a score for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a and salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon ro@@ gues ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands of dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter on h@@ ash@@ tag # 2 .
if you would like to know more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , completely re@@ pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; learning from drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , telling these victims and telling stories about people who were in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the P@@ ain of Vic@@ tims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life changes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly those stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father , who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma &apos;s Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on only one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare again today for the task that we have set ourselves , to go and search for tom@@ bs , for the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me .
at the moment , she has no income .
you are entitled to my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not pay her because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to show not only the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come across newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or look at this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he is big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic crimes &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anim@@ osity of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they do not stir and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the city district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business month by month until they were torn apart not only by the business but also torn apart their family .
you think of all that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of it never goes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded with her words :
we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when to kid@@ nap or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I must learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega has published the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation @-@ drawn generation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , s@@ own potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; ch@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence by organised crime and the fight against it ming@@ led with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor numbered 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and which inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ real words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this entry and the pages to which he links , include pictures depicting violence .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or to expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but what about the years after something has emerged for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first publication it has been mis@@ guided to have trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false connection between picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous trails full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to it .
local authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a movie theaters , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses scattered and cor@@ rupted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12 . January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not come to an end .
over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , but fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and Lei@@ ch@@ ame lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a man to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be shown figur@@ atively .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the B@@ oko Har@@ am attempt to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo came up again , as it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive usage of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented classi@@ fications to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely mis@@ er@@ ase the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the le@@ thal persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a ligh@@ tening report published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee were beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following arose , bringing these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , fal@@ sely claiming to be the president of Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an being , monks and politicians were involved in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from the DR Congo to capture this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news agencies , which called AF@@ P as their source , also mistakenly called Th@@ an to write this statement , but did not have the picture taken from the DR Congo .
the world @-@ wide range of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 images under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned picture of the DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private sites , social media platforms and national and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , some others have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have defined examples of ab@@ u@@ sive usage and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which they were published on which page they were published . thus , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which have been linked to each other in some cases ) , several examples may be used for ab@@ u@@ sive use .
here are some cases which can now be completely sen@@ sed ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news frames .
country examples of false head@@ ings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers where the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports are still available .
the gray countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available on Tin@@ Eye , probably also demonstrate counter@@ f@@ eit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( judged by Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Malaysia offers two extreme example of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , expressing sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand trying to del@@ egi@@ timi@@ ze the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government released a ju@@ g@@ gling of what they agreed to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately fin@@ alized news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this rec@@ tification , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operates and used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar has acknowledged His being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to be included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the now deleted , the Kath@@ olische UniversitÃ¤t message page An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was subsequently circul@@ ated in connection with the 2015 B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the paper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria .

the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , presum@@ ed to be in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was t@@ wit@@ ched as a test@@ ament to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and rescu@@ ed over 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages associated with it have not been taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to focus attention on the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message , allegedly dra@@ fted by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums such as this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it illegal .
from the message in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ inet mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos agreed .
there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .

frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
understanding religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images any longer .
with social media , there are dozens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ishes the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equal to recognizing the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the concern is that violent images will des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and emp@@ ower them to emp@@ ower emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used from context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive kind .
however , any examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( currently un@@ en@@ for@@ ce@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
these words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ alu@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bri@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT @-@ lap language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - As@@ k for your parents in recognition of how you care for you in your younger years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
words in the H@@ uns@@ wick language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you war@@ med up in the sun in cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about his blog about :
they determined other cultures , reveal other thoughts and aw@@ aken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these little languages are .
speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favourite wines here .

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ for@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have been tram@@ pled over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion of the Sri Lanka disaster relief from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing due to floods and mud .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations .
ra@@ inf@@ all occurred on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give you an impression of the scale of the floo@@ ding catastrophe :
high water in Ta@@ vol@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods d@@ wind@@ le the den@@ gue fever , Save the Children , after more rain@@ falls are already on its way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the water cone of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a yesterday .
the air force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and further five are completed to transport emergency supplies to the residents enclosed in their flooded villages .
different organizations and start @-@ ups have also decided to help .
help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry foods and nec@@ essi@@ ties for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ pr@@ ana .
please call 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if you need assistance in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks worried people to share their location data with the app to inform the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ y Centre .
last year after the catastrophe of the Ro@@ an@@ u tropical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . they were then forwarded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people included in floods and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring residents in need of security and provide aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , with the population of Sri Lanka the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March will be held in San Francisco on January 21 , 2017 .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
I trust in her my four years old daughter ; she tru@@ sts with her children . she is my rock in the fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next generation , we are making rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some consider the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , tied out of an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they have to lim@@ ate me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look alike .
we practise our religion differently .
we are thus identifying ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in it , are being m@@ ated .
to be de@@ hydr@@ ated
I &apos;m not alone .
this has happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western notion , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as did the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid pulled down the story behind these images .
but these pictures still stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to dis@@ courage them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narrative dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even elect its first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this fol@@ r@@ ative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , and Saudi Arabian women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has been so deep and fla@@ wed by our collective imagination that Si@@ kh men and children often become anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to which 1.7 billion are owned
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the Muslim population is Afri@@ cans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York . sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan imagined the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were inevitable Muslims and Americans .
but am I now inevitable Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I do not eat pork , I say - instead of getting out my Muslim recipes or taking my handy pocket or@@ am , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all T@@ ash@@ enk@@ or@@ ane with us .
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be a Muslim or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated fundament@@ alism machine with don@@ ors , think tanks , and experts for false information that have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , there is anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility in more than just a stranger who tears the veil on a woman .
or as the frigh@@ tening card of attacks on mos@@ ques across the US , see below .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as Muslims , but to be a Muslim has only been born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my friend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf would see that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter , when I was silent in my arms , and she would give her the Arabic verse to the protection that seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the picture of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters ; as she has been winning a competition for the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi several decades ago .
it is the image of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saints ; and a Koran with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
to be Muslims consists in how she taught me to relate to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - over centuries - has been colon@@ ized by a &quot; empire , &quot; which has founded a company with the name of Hon@@ orable British Eastern Partnership , it has a profound significance to call God my only Lord .

belonging is to grow up and to hear that men don &apos;t cry , but at the same time seeing that my entre@@ ated grandfather we@@ eps .
meanwhile , while writing books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , a family dominated by India in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game .
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; all the four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected over a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ est military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy sp@@ ends the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ ores , was called by a fre@@ eing black slave called Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life counts .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist mean the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is made up of the Muslim registry related to President Bush and extended to President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officers who take a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that closes its borders against people from just the countries that bom@@ bard them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we bring and the bombs that we are throwing down on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University participated in a scientifically un@@ told picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous prints that we get in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and this moment has consequences beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they are master@@ ing large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who today made me an un@@ miss@@ able Muslim .
things that I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ ble in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that may evo@@ ke memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity is about , a story may lie where someone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be led and people were enth@@ used by the &quot; other &quot; in public perception , was even a scientist of Stan@@ ford four decades ago .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of becoming aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already po@@ unded broken lands and &quot; to other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
story@@ telling initiative aims to preserve urban linguistic diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible response .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ alu@@ able blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
the cre@@ ators of the project are :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to often &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; these events are instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening , to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers first introduce and translate their story in their own language or declare them in English .
even if the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ ellers , their dedication and representation demonstrate that the audience is att@@ un@@ ed to it .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video , for example , shows a traditional story in Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of Daf@@ ing . during this round , the story @-@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ata also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the har@@ es and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his ability , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your speech ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;ve listened !
they were alert ...
they were with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling .
Puerto Rico claims from US re@@ establishment of sovereign debt
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ese Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural testing of the debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church assembly of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishment of debt have also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for debts are accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in the public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ mailing and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand immediate action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
thus , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ designer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ na@@ y , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director at Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is now roy@@ alty @-@ free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it pays homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense out of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about its current status or location .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push@@ es for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process from temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activists has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that Bass@@ el founded , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ que cultural prototypes was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he started with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here mer@@ ges Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria , but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet completed this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life living from freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in prison .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
he taught other det@@ ain@@ ees how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding them in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ z@@ uch that she wrote to her husband in 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens during each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your charming eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ,
that every one of the dangers does not matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I would go into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes bid farewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to take back all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep about your absence and smile .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :

while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you still are in the cage of the monsters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bash@@ ar &apos;s story is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention by 2016 .
the stories of many more people remain unknown .
the global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our call today in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : because of corruption convic@@ ted director to release Haf@@ tar again on previous post
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to work in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is Di@@ o@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for disp@@ ers@@ al of 54 million me@@ tics ( some 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose council Cam@@ ba@@ za ruled between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his rein@@ statement to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which claimed the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to rel@@ inqu@@ ish his old post , as the company did not accomplish any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment .
however , many residents don &apos;t care about the action .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish its director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in view of the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the infrin@@ gement .
the company apparently was silent and did not make appropriate legal action for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had to be served .
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za would like to pay for his silence .
re@@ fut@@ ed !
bit@@ ons Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil , says the director does not have any mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za does not want to return to morality and serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served in the state itself .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in jail :
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president forever , but also as a sharp , one @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - a proph@@ etic speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all capable of selling the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and released .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ itting b@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ectives &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c. in Burma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely negative con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the word or have doubts about their use were cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings , which have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written in Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der b@@ lower ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ki@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that she will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before removing all posts that are suspected of racism .
Facebook won &apos;t delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the opposite words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech get a pretty good lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is time to cut off nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the action may send a strong signal to anyone spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
social networking experiences such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of slo@@ gans is often a cat and mouse game , using social networks simply to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , post and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inheritance cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they only had a little more respect for the 15 million use that gave them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts which did not contain any hate speech , but were still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check if Facebook removes the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , heal people then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally inc@@ ite violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine territory , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook was critici@@ zed for its failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese pages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context than initiatives focused on code and learn from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is ending with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously decided on a law to ban this practice , so that the age @-@ related age is now 18 .
in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , each person under 18 years &quot; defined .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 1997 from 1997 to 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were ende@@ avor@@ ing to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
however , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law .
but early in 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ res@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one voted against it .
after it was decided in the Senate before , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws on children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who dresses a minist@@ erial post at the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel kept the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was happy that the day had finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the law of marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that talked quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the age of marry in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft of the amend@@ ment to the law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 MPs in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present during the voting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all members of the Parliament , who were against , voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is legally prohibited in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # clu@@ b@@ ag@@ ei@@ portra@@ y@@ abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought against him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s most famous Hind@@ u organization .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps if the law was adopted , and he seems to fulfil his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to address the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
rather than talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem , we would say that the state , which protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men opposed to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where child marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm although there are laws that they prohi@@ bit .
hack@@ ers roll the office of the prosec@@ utor against national protests on the Russian national holiday
screen printing of the message posted on Sunday morning on the Public Prosecutor &apos;s website of Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l Municip@@ ality .
on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ de with the day of Russia - the Russian national holiday - the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website was hack@@ ed by Y@@ ar@@ os@@ lav@@ l Municip@@ ality . hack@@ ers left a wit@@ ty message &quot; ble@@ ach home . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or we bring you to the jail instead of Dim@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not Dim@@ on for you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the prosec@@ utor &apos;s website with the following comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office calls the citizens to follow the pro@@ voc@@ ations and keep themselves away from all non @-@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the side - but in the cache she remained .
it has not disappeared
on Sunday , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office informed the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were hack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content .
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , contrasting with the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright laws in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites ( a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third largest VPN ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking items from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007 after the Internet law ( no . 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform is still locked , multiple mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia ) are now sur@@ faced .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform dis@@ covers all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its dedicated peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
despite legal prohibition , the content is available .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we all used to store sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was conducted independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the barrier .
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the necessity for nature conservation
a stirring rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors .
that motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the banks of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in just a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately began kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood face to face with tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the hum@@ p@@ man appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he gaz@@ es at me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , mostly living in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding there were Indian women for the first time to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India .
a revised version was re @-@ released as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women are avoiding women with the greatest care to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , preserve this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by a false court in the indi@@ an state of O@@ dish@@ a and expelled from her family and the village community after having contacted a married couple with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer allow@@ ances to fear , if at all they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city .
it is a place only for them , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs available in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with her video camera for seven years on the disclosure of practices such as child marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and leads these clubs .
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion consisted of women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name .
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the discussion of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
to speak out loud the names of their hus@@ bands is a custom that they all perpet@@ ually maintain and never questioned .
what Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and desires a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
how to tell Roh@@ ini :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this confidence in luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then they all asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can name us as they want , does it mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on breaking up a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women may never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands .
how to tell Roh@@ ini :
a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise she ch@@ ased away , and another decided to leave the whole stra@@ ined fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in rush of adren@@ alin on having broken with an age @-@ old custom , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rou@@ tes said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a participant in a participant was less understanding and the situation resulted in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ cent red dot on the forehead , which indicates the sp@@ ouses :
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ cent red dot if he did .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing him .
the other women have not completely stopped working , but they think they are in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women the disc@@ us club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lun@@ ches and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to make sure who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to tell certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes .
some women in the group have only wore sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ sa @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , morality combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hin@@ den ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will get it .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things start rolling slowly :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have only taken small steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tasted it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband .
some , including me , still do it , but only if they are alone and are not members of the family .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the disc@@ us club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a river that is difficult to navigate .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all in the same boat .

the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
people here became clear very quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .

we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll John L@@ enn@@ on should represent or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese people naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places related to the band .

right now in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked across the Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year .

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be attacks in Mozambique .
photo : different bolt / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , worried the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and some of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently declared that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
there was a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could contain gold or wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia said to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the target of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led the UN to conduct a mission in the South African country in order to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ am@@ bic@@ an police according to the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sene Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police were already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also acknow@@ le@@ dges the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , according to which the victims in the head would have power to generate riches .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ nai@@ ppa explaining that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ WIT@@ HO@@ UT A country in which people would have shame to go on the streets as if they were ashamed of the recordings of a por@@ no@@ graphic in which the teachers would be ashamed to earn their bread , a country in which people would not hurt or even bald or bald @-@ headed for dev@@ out purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humor .
Zen@@ aida Mak@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both sk@@ inn@@ ed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique &apos;s authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in November 2015 , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i &apos;s wife , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that she was contacted by people who were spending themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but they did not receive any further information .
Bas@@ hir &apos;s stay and constitution had been unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s creativity as a pioneer in the open web is the honor .
and we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the last five years .
since 2011 and the start of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the organization of Syrian Network for Human Rights .

free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the det@@ ained Chinese dissi@@ dent , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years &quot; imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state danger ) after he took part in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that challenged democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he deemed it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community to release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have fully wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
unified nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ enden refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was granted to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it had nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u as she announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to impose all restrictions on Mr Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad announced that the Americans &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the message asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy &apos;s call drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Foreign Ministry that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told China that China should offer the following to the couple :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations .
the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can get into a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; receives all the medical support he needs and that a humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President Xi J@@ in@@ ping was released on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing by the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns about whether the fuss about Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide Li@@ u an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P beforehand that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak and contact with someone outside , including his attor@@ neys .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom to exercise these rights .
France and France
in a declaration on 29 June , China &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures need to be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately take it up .
Taiwan and Taiwan
the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan appe@@ aled to China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance to those who are campaig@@ ning for peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu , of the reign@@ ing Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only Singapore political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports Singapore as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o blog acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country , one hears that we are ultimately no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it seemed an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries , &quot; in view of this , it appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are led permanently by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re is re@@ appearing from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given responses to his American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dic@@ ative , our political system really not answers .
he cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ged the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers ration@@ ally .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to explain this point if he was paid highly in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just choices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment with Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam who , as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of Singapore political leaders , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is right and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beli@@ ve a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian spokes@@ man ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet of government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but don &apos;t they defend their city ?
who does our prime minister need to pay back invoices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but this is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadi@@ ans &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication then follows the standard answer most of the time : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly with anger , if they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know each other , there is little difference between Canadi@@ ans and Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no guns here !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if one would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas for example .
Marc out of Austin .
mit Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , being called &quot; nice &quot; means to be idle - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders of &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can come across .
being harmless means being in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from things that happen around you .
I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major property of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I connect with my American friends in the meantime .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that de@@ codes the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and in spite of its promises to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the prescri@@ ptions of his girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly politically , the music video refers indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times was shared and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta leadership .
take a look at these videos of the videos which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 Rules of Girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the Dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change in attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear prec@@ ep@@ ts are often used by the authorities to arrest the activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , which monitors the online content and prosec@@ uted people accused of being slan@@ dered by the monarchy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand uses a stri@@ pped face against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand .
two days later , there was a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat of the army .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , even though security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black v@@ ans before placing them in an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison terms , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society only slowly re@@ covers in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now passed over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic War has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ yn@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Ne@@ ar @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war era more than 10,000 people lived here , today only a few hundred people are living in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ow@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elderly man .
he starts talking and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens who all served the community .
now there is only paved road with remaining magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planned economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district in the meantime .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty people live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the ch@@ ry@@ osh@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which accommodate one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where washing is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed home .
when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has banned us from being photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply prohibited us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultiv@@ ating farm products for their own needs ) such as livestock farming , be@@ ekeeping and growing vegetables .
it &apos;s hard to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration supplies candles and bread to the villages free of charge .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave from Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia for ever , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive any financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says .
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells her that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we &apos;ll build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha also receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day how the city and the war once were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation turns to an end , a little boy is running past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy is ch@@ asing him behind .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure that they live in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it otherwise .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border of Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and gold coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
it &apos;s rather quiet at the moment , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also been sleeping outside on boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy drugs that they cannot pay , she massages them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a proper nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ call@@ i , who has a Yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who is hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a normal first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel the route together and that Afri@@ cans are already speaking at W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez says that her guests often send their text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a blind alley leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family recorded migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled with his wife and three children in Honduras , who wanted to black@@ mail money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single woman , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the corri@@ dors , travellers should consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones quietly .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems to be happy that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ ma , she leaves with a lot of photos in her album .
there is one of her daughter with African hair lichen , which she made a kun@@ din , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she presents her briefly .
&quot; yes , fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the authorities didn &apos;t have to use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police reported that the app was investigating and prosec@@ uting the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app with min@@ ors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can , of course , be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ orship in China most often focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those living in remote , troubled ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media outlet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is based on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were random@@ ly checking the inhabitants to see if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile alert requested that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they might be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices intended for elderly people .
this is a form of captivity by the rest @-@ technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also published a j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description which indicates that the software can lift up the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions issued by the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
all branches of government , government and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi an ordin@@ ance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos . however , this action inf@@ ring@@ es the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible crime rates , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Zar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize you &apos;re all alone in a place where everything you need is missing .
everything has gradually dissip@@ ated and revealed a truth that is clearly identi@@ fiable from both inside and outside .
one that hon@@ ours their name .
one who has sat down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform themselves into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the Earth continues on the A@@ xis of Un@@ hei@@ ls . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone built around stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security guard formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been stuff@@ ed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ming up after the power supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a magnificent image that filled my expectations fully and completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet in the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed them all the way up to the office of security service .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me also hear how you write Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar , or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you have dar@@ ed to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed sentence is still in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ amed through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I remember all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise , they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner and can immediately set me up without waiting for her permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the bureau@@ crat left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old tried and tested method of communication : beating the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ th@@ hi@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
apparently in no one of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks like me and is called the doctor .
in perfect darkness there are no markings on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers are linked to its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to drive away all these crow@@ s that lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries are heard every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that gave us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this revealed the secret : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from fre@@ eing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view .
this is not a house here , this is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal into a hero into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me like that .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that slide him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start much more important with your life than join these di@@ aries and protest on demonstrations that will soon end up . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have grown accustomed to not answering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and blows have become an ordinary communication tool for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any voice in me told me that I had to get used to the punishment of being punished , even though I did nothing to deserve this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in all its diversity .
his command is to s@@ nat@@ ch as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your scre@@ ams .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , which is why they exchanged the pipe with a cable .
at my first arrest I asked if the investig@@ ator used to work as a garbage collector or if that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables in order to present the great invention of a giant cable , from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them switched off while I was still in the row .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t really enjoy it , which is why he was next to an electrically charged bar .
electricity flooded my entire body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my semi @-@ naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to lie down again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which occurred to me like minutes .
then the call for the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted child : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father , must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and go , you will be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always kept me free .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he sl@@ um@@ bs to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ lows ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as ori@@ ental racism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his way of thinking and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the disa@@ strous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t admit it openly , he has a special dis@@ like against the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian @-@ wing@@ ed second generation , &quot; he says himself , even though he was born in Jordan and never before was in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured Nes@@ cafÃ© in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan , during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with age @-@ old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically speaking the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ vy of the K@@ ent @-@ Cig@@ ar@@ ette in the nose primarily speak of freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when looking at the neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan drinking water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , Jordan &apos;s Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert event .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and ex @-@ press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to &quot; use &quot; for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly clear , cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b brought back traditional gender standards to Lei@@ be by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch all the way up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust .
in recent years , the number of &apos; Ehren@@ mor@@ es &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official out@@ war@@ dly left .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honor mur@@ ders in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is compo@@ unded that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on crime eradic@@ ation from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from subjects that long as t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , he ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit all@@ u@@ sions to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was notified of politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ ar@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs , which are political in essence , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse repe@@ ats notic@@ e@@ ably many times :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can &quot; get what you want &quot; - whether it is faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bians and that comment@@ aries on gender equality have been heavily cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online programme Ro@@ ya , to note later that his comments were torn from context , twisted and cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly promoting the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and advoc@@ ates that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not ent@@ ail Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ something , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ wa , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tian kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanctions attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service noted several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , stating that they have critically addressed the problems in social media that are related to corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordan .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that &apos;s how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dreams not only of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached with a genuine and fundamental openness by music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least it hopes that .
until it is done , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore also resist .

Neb@@ ras@@ a in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ ras@@ a festival .
it is believed that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the pra@@ ms , drums and dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the West mar@@ ched in the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ ras@@ a festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ ras@@ ka Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .

the sight of an 18 @-@ meter @-@ tall car was incredible .

rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep away the Peru@@ vian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate profession such as the hair@@ dres@@ sers .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and therefore the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens venture into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts are competing against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in the bar@@ ber art , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year commen@@ cing in March and reported some of its successes :
in 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because out of love for the children we have built this educational community .

only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , forming the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international recognition of the treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before the Colom@@ bians lies a long way , until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , who have been subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now integrate into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians should unite and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need them much more .
he was planning to share his love with people this year , need@@ ing the most urgent need .
thus the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former warri@@ ors of the F@@ ARC , who now have their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is prepared to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace , &quot; she says .
to date , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN shel@@ ters in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation , travelled to the camp to personally hand over the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC established themselves as they had done earlier in order to counter the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later told .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after we had handed over the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life somebody wrote something like that , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
perhaps he too was tired of the war , he was tired of being the faithful companion of this comb@@ at@@ ant all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else of life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society there , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in hiding .
therefore the leaders of the F@@ ARC announced the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the State affected the whole Colum@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a target of this magnitude , it is worth overcoming all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard of hearing and had no suff@@ rage , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate , were only people with beautiful feelings surrounded by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former warri@@ ors have replied to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger , and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to resort to weapons , rise and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons .
therefore , we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be facing many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and whose original publication took place on the website of OC Media .
homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of hazards , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs up like a dam@@ n value over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not been created overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what &apos;s currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured international head@@ lines several months after reports have been published that address the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ az@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities suspected of que@@ er que@@ er men and hiding them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
out of fear of her life , she finally moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that the photos from my documents made the round through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day .
apparently some women had taken everything along and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had sum@@ mon@@ ed an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which patient wings were you laid - in which of the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there &apos;s still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I first read his name on his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me with respect .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I was threatened with threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that it was all a lie .
they asked me that I had to prove it by walking up without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have particle size C - what would I have to say on television ?
OC Media : how did your family manage to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once said to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window stood a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened the third time it became clear to me that there was something la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without registering , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; right now , when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are . you even know your room number .
just to prove it to you : it &apos;s the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender balance , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme .
I still wear some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera I actually try to figure out how the person looks out to whom she re@@ members from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that no people were arrested and tor@@ tured during Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
this is what I mean , they are probably charging their relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has been experienced by blood .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there aren &apos;t many .
if , then above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped from their relatives in order to make Cad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are recorded there so that one can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people had not simply disappeared , they were deliberately immersed in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown their beard .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was by himself when these people were taken along .
up to now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have not been reports before . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think it was already before 2003 that I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was living there - and I never had any problems .
seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally cast us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes jeans and short tops .
the security department of Sh@@ aria has never har@@ med me just one hair .
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . this means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people often say it to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes before you , because they believed you were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period stop ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - one could sense how people started to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic worsen@@ ed steadily .
OC Media : what are your activities now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food tickets .
I won &apos;t c@@ ents for it for a long time .
I discovered these people themselves when I cl@@ apped a refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ d@@ ab item ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ ber .
nature has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ an have which , the Cab@@ ins , have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who walk to the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think about identity at men who love men , and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab @-@ Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the last months there has been a sharp increase in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ asi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who are working in Ah@@ wa@@ z want to remain anonymous .
a video that was shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could no longer do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights told that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - got caught up .
their stories have one thing in common : all the family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families on the grounds of persecution by the Iranian government , were hel@@ pless and unable to follow safe work .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , located in the Arab @-@ Arab community living in Iran , has been sh@@ attered by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the indigenous Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy conquered power and assumed great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often a victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and priv@@ ations .
the Iranian regime has systematically denied the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab areas to the Persian territory , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroying the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi young now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian director general for cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
as function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their native Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone Arabic language or carrying Arabian clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi must endure , human rights activists are beating alarm before the situation will explo@@ sively .
it remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why not identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
they can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves an inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even present well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * inside .
for example , today , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they can do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on gender still draws across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced and I am suffering dou@@ bly and thre@@ ef@@ old underneath .
I am a black woman .
yet , if I get to speak on skin color , on racism , on black women &apos;s women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the di@@ as@@ por@@ a ; if I mention what kind of body we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , decide not to mention many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my lord &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of institution@@ alised violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as the school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose centre stands the white woman who refuses to take account of injustice in her mind , which refers both to gender as well as to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 , so@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a fragmented and margin@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which also by cultural appropri@@ ation absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to dis@@ soci@@ ate myself fully from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can stand up to black women and women of other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm .
I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life neither b@@ yp@@ assed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a particular concern from the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the Water@@ - Iraq non @-@ governmental organisation - a subsidiary of Water@@ - Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities that can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ ght@@ fully ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ husband , who had become violent .
since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman appeared in Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of ill @-@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez did not see anything .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women pay an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all .
cont@@ ent@@ s@@ 1 blows and statistics 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that is nothing inferior to 3 Paragu@@ ays : good approach , inadequate implementation of blows and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social science research facility in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports which , however , do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 cases of domestic violence were reported to the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of this was violence against women .
86 % of the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 indications for domestic violence in peace courses . 86 % of women &apos;s advertisements were also found here .
in the advertisements 40 % of women said they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are 9 women who do not do this in Paraguay because of mental abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men .

un@@ seen mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she wore psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise :
I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of ill @-@ treatment .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happened to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing a name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had so long left Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ o te Cre@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) made up of women who are all victims of abuse in any way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s case everything began with mental mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began beating them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she did not receive support .
she carried out a trial against her former partner , who developed into an opa@@ que legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , inadequate implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament on 10 August 2016 , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ tec .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Genti@@ le Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original bill of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ izi@@ d should be declared an independent criminal off@@ ence and to punish severely as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
in this way , the legislative text has been modified in a number of ways in order to win the de@@ pu@@ ties of the law , who feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions was banned , which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is pun@@ ishable by up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had intended to cost much of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence currently have to bear , if they simply wish to refund and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri is argu@@ ing that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here , a re@@ thinking has to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as normal .
anyone who is silent in the face of these facts is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators are out@@ law@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to make a long @-@ term report until abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate , but before that , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage was canc@@ eled , which the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes are going on .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to re @-@ attack his victim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a big set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper still exposed to attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Afgh@@ an authorities closed the independent Arabic @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan@@ te .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a prison sentence of one year .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i were also arrested and brought to trial , but were later released .
since 1970 , Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid who came to power after he had deposited his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , along with his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , restric@@ ting civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 security forces arrested I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor in chief of Az@@ am@@ n , after he published an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking Parties Hand of Justice &quot; in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing Ju@@ dges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a judgment in an inheritance dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Editorial Board , was invited by the ISS to the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief at Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place in Mas@@ kat &apos;s trial .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the paper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the state &apos;s pres@@ tige . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of viol@@ ating a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3000 Afgh@@ an ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was arrested on a b@@ ail of 5000 Afgh@@ an ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the imprisonment of his six @-@ month prison sentence in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his sentence of imprisonment .
in addition , the Court of Appe@@ al rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the paper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the Court &apos;s decision to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Afgh@@ an government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information submitted a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister once again ordered the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ appoint the publication of the paper .
the continuing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren &apos;t the only cases in which the freedom of the press has been viol@@ ated recently in Oman .
other injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the Afgh@@ an authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is calling for the Alban@@ ian authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances , human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including court ch@@ ic@@ ans .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighboring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Image by his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines lacking in the global healthcare system that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists will help build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi Healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens .
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being a maker .
the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to return or reloc@@ ate here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GM : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make articles accessible for payment ( called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salad in the US since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding .
the patents prove not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cro@@ oked leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as crop or cart@@ on varieties . plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but it now takes longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river there is a b@@ oul@@ der to which I have to ride . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if they stand before the courts , no one can breed a new type of salad , because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he is very careful and tries to use no material protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined forces in the United States and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts from the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ geous variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . it tests whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source Se@@ ed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders may commit themselves to free use of the seeds they have bred .
however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents .
since its launch in 2014 , dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative .
glo@@ omy outlook
Professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are in control of the seed and the ability to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger cohesi@@ on such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the open @-@ source movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seed , &quot; the recent examples of the amal@@ gam@@ ation of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Bayer , as it is offered in August and September 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to keeping their seed available free of charge , as opposed to using seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is un@@ ce@@ as@@ ingly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights available on plant material .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property , which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or only difficult .
there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that plants that have been grown larger than wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit targeted traits - from those that improve their taste or colour to such as they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders de@@ votes more and more patents . at present , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the modified conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encourage other breeders &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it different : waiting for 20 years until a patent falls , certainly not promoting innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow crops that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight already .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to be : &quot; independent breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us forward and it will be impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mor@@ ton is bo@@ thered by the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants make up for themselves and as breeders we have no idea how plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if you breed a variety , you also breed its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures are required for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides , which breed into its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such who operate in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks as though I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patented .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent they are protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it quite simple in my opinion . &quot; worldwide resonance
although the US seems to be leading in open source breeding , the concept is rapidly spreading throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source seed seed programme . &quot; to preserve the seed of traditional crop varieties , the Centre collabor@@ ates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or in other parts of the world . )
in early November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , has declared that conven@@ tionally cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; it is now up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards seed pat@@ enting .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program for Open Source Se@@ ed Systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for Open Source Se@@ ed Systems for which the official start @-@ up will be scheduled for next year .
a combination of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global Alliance for the Future of Food - has published a report published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid above all to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest cens@@ orship objectives in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ GE@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reports about them .
in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained intact despite this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as important as it is now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human Rights Organization of the wave of web @-@ side barriers to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada no more access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog to spread columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible for Egypt .
now the blog , which he directed to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider on which also Zi@@ adas blog is home , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting on the student protests and recording a video , as the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada said to the government and reflected what this meant for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blo@@ gging of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , sum@@ mons by the National Security Council , the blo@@ gging blog and any other web page I was working for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence , albeit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
now , however , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave will go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked access to 133 sites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , through the circum@@ vention of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such a practice suggests the intention of the government to further block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access .
the situation is worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can act against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government willing to go to cens@@ orship and who will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in Brazil are reporting with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the country &apos;s second largest city and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assass@@ inated , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed dispens@@ ary with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , na@@ vy and air port to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 has reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
for example , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that is devi@@ ated from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : it &apos;s not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
it is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that doesn &apos;t know the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for In@@ ner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 domains that are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions to cover up .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as has been shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historic and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of public service .
reminder : Rio de Janeiro State is larger than its capital .

to design@@ ate Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; says C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at morph@@ ologies per federal state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as C@@ ec@@ Ã­@@ lia emphasizes , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police service and permanently station@@ ing a unit .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the designation &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also dra@@ gs serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war . this includes entering the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
one week now , the police have climbed the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines : an or@@ chard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities face brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians , is particularly affected .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpet@@ rated .
since 2013 , these rebel controlled areas have stood under siege outside Damascus , causing local residents to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points of smu@@ g@@ gled food .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as to plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it gains more and more awareness . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to teach 125 families to grow mushrooms , said Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about â¬ 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do by Monday , 4th September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the prop@@ ell@@ ant shortage , locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said global voices that they began with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the cultivation of mushrooms for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by eating lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee kit , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , who are linked to their home .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant up in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in Gali@@ cia in Spain where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread to the north and centrally located regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande where there were 64 fat@@ alities and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite recordings , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
Portugal burns within the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017
some Twitter users shared images :
that is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ gos@@ PT
numerous videos dissemin@@ ate online and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire prevention measures by the state .
people wonder why civil protection was not able to limit the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o sovereign@@ al of the Con@@ federation of farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the woods of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law allowing construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environment organisation Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , spread out , as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when residents sought information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the fire bri@@ gade work and this fat@@ eful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers didn &apos;t stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban began .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
right at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew that she wouldn &apos;t see her son very long - maybe never again .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Hes@@ ara @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af re @-@ found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
at that time , like today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked .
there was no service and no heating there . we hung nylon before the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af abandoned his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , walking alone through the streets of Rome , sleeping in parks and walking to a church that distributed food to those in need twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high earning quot@@ as , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country find are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ trained personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be admitted to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can still go for months after the application of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also called A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ restra@@ ined desire of life helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions .
after spending several years working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that he opened a second hostel and fast food after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind vene@@ tian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 people in Italy live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the companies operating in Afghanistan have sprung up , including dres@@ s@@ making , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ du@@ a the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
A@@ shar@@ an &apos;s targets , however , reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim to return to the country that it forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also makes plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and finishing techniques . &quot; this is how they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stands stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen report : legal dra@@ fts from Egypt facilitate the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for over 900 days in prison .
he reported about the clearance of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and upcoming trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months following a successful law decision on the website of the authority , indicating their full name and identification number .
those who failed to take this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the termination of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was applied by sixty members of the Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of parliament submitted a proposal to introduce stric@@ ter pun@@ ishments for the insul@@ t of the president or a senior civil servant .
under Egyptian law , the insul@@ ting of the President as well as state institutions is pun@@ ishable already . however , under the legislative proposal , such a crime would be pun@@ ishable by prison and fin@@ es , as judicial experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be adopted , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly would have been in danger anyway for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against prot@@ esters demonstrating for the inaugur@@ ation of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident , four years in prison for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the accused to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan faces the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , mo@@ dest@@ ly burden of inter alia , weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke to the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist inter@@ ro@@ gated to doc@@ tor@@ ed documents
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan explicitly endor@@ sed a controversial draft bill that would grant business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , if they return all un@@ law@@ fully preserved funds .
the document released on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia denied the mention of his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , at the District Court in Tunis , on 9 May , he witnessed in the fall .
will China force the users of social media to show their identity ?
according to new regulations of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
in the Reg@@ ulations it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that this will prevent the elimination of anonymous comments into conversations within social networks . up to now it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to only sel@@ ectively enforce these rules in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed Russia &apos;s access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ wei@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat missed to register with the provincial government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organis@@ er of information broad@@ ening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law of 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and forcing them on request to susp@@ end user data .
websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ gor@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services are currently on these websites .
Turkish court has locking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ruled the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to extingu@@ ish two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to create a political diff@@ am@@ ination campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey totally blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop ch@@ illing out
once this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . responses and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
