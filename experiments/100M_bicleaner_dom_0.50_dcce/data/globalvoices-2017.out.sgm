<seg id="1">Although I had visited the United States since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and pursued his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who wanted to occupy the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnet with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free according to Method Man," "" "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona was only strengthening my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very sentimental love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never thinks behind the mountain with his opinion, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague expressed it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number obtained by the party nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deep faith person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even Trump Weltanschauung did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Slinging intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights for her life long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still adapts to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, which always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange the people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those looking different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (OB.: "white against all other ethnic groups"; pun from white in allusion to the Whites and whiplash, which means as much as the big Van Jones, has killed exactly what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as its President, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">All this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "" "asked Mr. Khan." ""</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later, it was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trump Land, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province have in common with the children of the Paraguaean town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places not only has changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 kilometres south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now the La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome poverty with its musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and banal violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always laugh with gleaming eyes and play in the hustle and play day for day trumpets, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 km south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located on top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reworked instruments made from local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler led by Favio Chávez to transform parts of decay into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were produced from garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the garbage. the children did not know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments of remanufactured material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world produces about one billion tons of trash.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra performed its music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats illegal illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that purposefully reports about international, practical solutions for environmental issues.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known back then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the waters of the Liberian waters before the other coast of Africa was looking for.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were so upset about this and little inclined to welcome a Crusher of this kind at its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">In Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not possible for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia, because of pillage of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 was founded by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to detect. therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance by intentional disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries circulating, the actions nowadays happen in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attends the activities of ships when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious driving routes can be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">In the ideal case, such examinations can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing license, where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing may then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there are considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is an advisory firm supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The aforementioned platform was created to recover estimated $20 million in lost revenues, which the eight members of HISH-i network each year lose due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa is one of the most productive tuna fisheries that attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of fantasy names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an uncritically organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You mustn't walk my harbor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me' and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has so far been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspect vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has revealed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international agency for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across vast distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">The Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps track down the illegal vessels that love to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishery data and offers technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships shutdown their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is designed to help FISH-i to find interacting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform in collaboration with Google and the Oceana Marine Environment Agency: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed across the globe by means of the vessel's position.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing what - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detain criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which had been fished without license and had little to face with consequences now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now reported a 33% increase in fishery sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets on board where they were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become an object of study." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries have joined forces for the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "With security, the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state of Somalia was able to report its first big triumph: in October, it introduced Greko 1, a ship under false flag.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 is a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special, collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world sea.

<seg id="152">Her articles appear in Wired Magazine, TED education, the New York Times and the Guardian. situation in Venezuela continues to escalate: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of "recovering the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of María Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="156">Published under the Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="157">After the government rejected the application of opposition to a referendum on impeachment, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by relying on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the return of Venezuela) images of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including the Barinas lowland area, in the Andes Mérida and Táchira, in the central north-lying Bundestaat, Carabobo and at the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation is continually worsening, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but ultimately the reluctance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, which includes inflation and violence rates to the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual statement) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum on impeachment for many was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (approximately: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined together, urged the demonstrators to join the National Assembly on October 27.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil war and on 3 November all to Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter there are pictures that tell of disputes, as well as reports of repression and ill-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially big waves smelled the news of police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators moved to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government according to their own testimony.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country some demonstrators tried to stop the police, including this woman in the Andean State of Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira don't wear coats, because otherwise you could see something that many national gardists don't have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile an infographic already accounts for the amount of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">In this way, the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for an impeachment procedure, which has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs:</seg>
<seg id="186">Nicolás and Diosdado claim that 1% of signatures are fake.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your impeachment!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has done little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to silence critical voices:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches always increase in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to witness the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now grown up, Quijano has now spoken against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">He started wearing the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">At that time, I believed that this was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not recognize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the secret service department 141 in the prison of La Perla from 1976 to 1978.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who was charged with abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quixos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who before a federal court pronounced against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>

<seg id="344">The sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto, where you can extend your driver's license.</seg>
<seg id="345">The photo was disseminated in social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Adaptation of the original pictures by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Kyoto Japanese city, customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong their driving license, witnessed a particularly misused translation in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">On a sign, the Japanese word (korobelow sha), which means "older drivers," wrongly - but perhaps also with malicious back thoughts & # 8212, was translated as "fearful motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable" "", "Holmes said." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The wrong English translation was first removed. the name "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit grammatically correct name "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt offended by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">"" "the Japanese online news service J-Cast News was somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of" "" "fearful" "" "older drivers in Japan and wrote:" ""</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents across the country is quite a cause for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, equivalent to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen overall, the proportion of accidents caused by the elderly has risen during the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The named Reporter brought comments to the light in the version of the article, which was published on Yahoo, which show what prejudices some Japanese seem to be against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">Among other things, the article on Yahoo about translation errors received the following comments:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the belief that translators in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost-finding or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who have no foreign employees themselves, still allow translations to be produced internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbose and enigmatic propositions that arise from machine translation show that this technique cannot be replaced by a human interpreter for a long time. this applies to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English wordings in Japan, including the mysterious prints that often adorn t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry, but by large companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, more accurate translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source of its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">"" "main page of the portal" "" "Navegar con Libertad" "" "(free surfing) of IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society)." ""</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the Internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also recorded footage of the protests in Caracas organized by oppositional groups that oppose Nicolás Maduro's government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests commenced at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the link was snapped and recommended to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that websites of Venezuelan providers are once again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ vivoPlayNet page.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informational national TV channels I have registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier investigations by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond correctly to certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If an Internet site is blocked by the DNS, the server replies incorrectly or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNA barrier: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third-locked channel, the transmission was suspended on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera Elvis Flores, who survived the protests in Caracas, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released and VPITV went on air again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>

<seg id="414">Today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testimonies of other Criaditas which were victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report written by Global Voices courtesy of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying Cows," falling schools "), edited and republished by Global Voices Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her university degree at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she said," "" "She said." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criadita, in Paraguay there is the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a big family with little money transfers their minor son or their underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child gets food, an apprenticeship and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to spend countless days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can become - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude being inoculated by the Criaditas would generally not be silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, which is their daughter in the belief that they will complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves," is handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that assimilates the girl and justifies their exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in paraguan households, got a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of severe beatings. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was the home of the former military master Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt (Einwohnermeldeamt).</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira beat Marín with a stick until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo, rooted in the Paraguayan society, responsible for the girl's death.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest rally and demanded that there be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," says Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a quick investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín may be trend-setting - for the first time in the Paraguayan history a case of Criadazgo will come to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when Farbik, in which her father worked, had to declare bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go all work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital of Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose up at five o'clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner it was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to go hungry, but she didn't have unlimited food. "I could fetch more books from the master's library than food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well-equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizer of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party who belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings, the landlord Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read editorials from the opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to persuade them to have no faith in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>

<seg id="473">Their masters feared that they would lose the education they had made it possible, "she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">"" "in school Alvarenga was also discriminated against." "" "one thing that is almost never talked about is bullying and harassment where Criaditas are exposed when they go to school." ""</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to my home. I didn't have a circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, during the time when friendships develop, I felt especially clear that I belonged to no group.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration. unclear is also how they should account for those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they control violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a trial process.</seg>

<seg id="524">This article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions. this article is published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan Region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activists Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the bigger family of leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persican Leopards (Panthera Pardus Saxicolor). they are endangered because of poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they always find less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "is the persian leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on the fact that a big predator is present." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza passionately wants to show another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs by Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to establishing protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan Region.</seg>

<seg id="538">Six years after the tsunami: the state of things in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and is still busy rebuilding the region.</seg>

<seg id="544">Early March 2017 documented the progress made for the northeastern Japan daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made over the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the "three-fold catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a real prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had destroyed entire coastal towns from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">In addition, the prefecture of Fukushima experienced a nuclear accident, already alone therefore 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local perspective which progress has been achieved six years after, in order to rebuild the lives of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as poll results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing development in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahou Shimpo-Zeitung reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of planned spare-homes (date-centred-time, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, where 80 percent of planned spare-homes were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light at 70 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="554">At the same time, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of temporary shelters (date of production, casetsu juutaku) is still to be relocated into final spare-homes.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-times catastrophe almost 80,000 people saw themselves forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36,000 people living in Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuation of Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in this area. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who were hauling after the disaster in temporary shelters, were resettled in final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo paper could determine, 1,074 of 1,100 schools affected by misfortune have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the fact that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident were affected extensively in the three prefectures of agrarian land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, whereby only 66 per cent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent of destroyed farmland can be used again in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land by Fukushima lie in the "nuclear borderline."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has recovered largely again, but here, too, Fukushima remains far away.</seg>
<seg id="567">The number of tourists in Miyagi and Iwate is up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahou Shimpo-Zeitung also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to measure an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation districts. it asked them about the status of the reconstruction and also how their perception changes over the tsunami risks.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami-consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahou Shimpo-Zeitung also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people from Fukushima were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the status of 2017 there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuation districts are older than 50 years old. it is known to have to be returned to real dwellings because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the common ground.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often realises that one more connects than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at exactly these global links. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni speaks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Emanuman explains how a migration overcame her affection for Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa speaks about the time when she worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had struck him with a strike against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil.</seg>

<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiana while he is in hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilerme Irish was assassinated by his father, only to criminalise the Occupy movement in secondary schools. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a policeman who has struck him with a headstock.</seg>

<seg id="616">Police brutally placed rubber bullets and tear gas at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators had set up a platform for speakers.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP, Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to relinquish violence against demonstrators via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, Brazilian media have covered road protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window pane.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo especially reported on a broken glass window in order to be illustrative with a photo of their front pages.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, the O Globo preferred a cover story with a set-up bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window screen than over the protests of thousands of people who are serving the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognized if one is strictly against any form of material damage.</seg>

<seg id="625">The villages forgotten by the deindustralization of Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories all over Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the Western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After succeeding, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commute daily to factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who stands every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region that are back in operation after a long inactive time, because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers to have heard exactly that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the volume produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are no more news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the Report "Agricultural Outlook" published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production reached the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would produce around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will come into history with certainty" "" "was the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane plant Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he frequently repeats is" "" "scam" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents said the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first closing year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents which differed only regarding the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulmer Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was overshadowed and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane mills that were still in operation," he affirms.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, waits for retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the creation of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he disassembled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important worksheet metal producer has been wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives were created for the work stations and services they were generating in the communities in which they were located.</seg>

<seg id="690">Shooting a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people in the First Nations community all over Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it by Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N 'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and working in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus increases that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self acceptance" or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the State of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribal of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called highway of tears, a section of road in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people do not always speak the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop group, who gave them a stopper in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in writing, as well a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to keep my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take our scream</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and lead to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what the Creator has destined for.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comments section, the reader and champion of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also adds a contribution and adds the verse in syllabus (which is also published on his blog and reissued here with approval):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, they are displayed near the entrance of the shokuhin sanpuru (the so called "artificial models of the courts") of any food served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see themselves in these plastic dishes and then decide whether they are entering the restaurant or going on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">There are a multitude of these small companies in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, who produce those plastic dishes that the German film maker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning it into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">In Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a number of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile belts decorated with plastic dishes, as shown at the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shockoo fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an kaisen-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a score for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura and salmon roe is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon rogues?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow Twitter on hashtag # 2.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to know more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa Cartel, completely repressed the stories of the victims of the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "learning from drug trafficking"), telling these victims and telling stories about people who were in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close, because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we need to show not only the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state leadership." ""</seg>

<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a lesbian of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that one should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come across newspaper kiosks every day and see the pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or look at this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he is big. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic crimes" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the animosity of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified by the fact that they were" "" "soaking" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies if they do not stir and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months of blackmail in the city district: how a family was plundered with threats." it describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business month by month until they were torn apart not only by the business but also torn apart their family.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of all that you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never goes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded with her words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, as one does not know when to kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to cry. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the contribution" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation-drawn generation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, sown potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "chchi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence by organised crime and the fight against it mingled with the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor numbered 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 killings per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and which invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of ever new headlines. however, this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rumor or to expose a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what about the years after something has emerged for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first publication it has been misguided to have tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false connection between picture and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker traversed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country has been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous trails full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Local authorities described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a movie theaters, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and corrupted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12. January 2015.Several photos of the incident form the gruesome scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities in which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and Leichame lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one was left to count corpses," "" "said a man to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">On the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be shown figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the Boko Haram attempt to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo came up again, as it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive usage of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented classifications to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely miserase the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange also appeared in connection with the lethal persecution of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightening report published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee were beaten, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following arose, bringing these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, falsely claiming to be the president of Myanmar's Than being, monks and politicians were involved in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from the DR Congo to capture this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Understanding religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images any longer.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are dozens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and diminishes the real horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"" "" "" "one argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equal to recognizing the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images will desensitize readers and viewers and empower them to empower empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used from context or completely abusive kind.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (currently unenforceable) endeavours to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these invaluable words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese Saudi) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish sobrimesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from the VAT-lap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Ask for your parents in recognition of how you care for you in your younger years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in the Hunswick language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after you warmed up in the sun in cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words about his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They determined other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They have to limate me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not all look alike.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practise our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We are thus identifying ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, who do not fit in it, are being mated.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be dehydrated</seg>
<seg id="1011">I'm not alone.</seg>
<seg id="1012">This has happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America: Rumi.</seg>

<seg id="1014">Love?</seg>
<seg id="1015">Peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were until the day he died, the centre of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western notion, the religion of Rumis was deleted, as did the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This folrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings, and Saudi Arabian women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1032">This narrative has been so deep and flawed by our collective imagination that Sikh men and children often become anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them, Islamophobia is not just fear of Islam, religion, but it is fear of the "other."</seg>

<seg id="1035">In the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of becoming aware and unconsciously the "other"; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president, the chocolate cake, while he already pounded broken lands and "to other made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible response.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the invaluable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The creators of the project are:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces in which inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while listening to" "" "listening to often" "", "these events are instead" "" "listening to" "" "instead" "" "listening, to appreciate, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first introduce and translate their story in their own language or declare them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their dedication and representation demonstrate that the audience is attuned to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions, as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video, for example, shows a traditional story in Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the story-teller Rassidatou Konata also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamara tells the tale of the hares and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his ability, John Nyamara is asked:" "" "how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your speech?" "" "with a wide grin, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You've listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were alert...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started at the Puertoriese Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>

<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is now royalty-free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It pays homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense out of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about its current status or location.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that pushes for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process from temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activists has been in custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the head of New Palmyra, a project that Bassel founded, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque cultural prototypes was more foresighted than the work he started with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merges Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria, but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet completed this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life living from freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He taught other detainees how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (Waiting), a prozuch that she wrote to her husband in 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated her from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mozambique reacted with anger on corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to work in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Dioino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment for dispersal of 54 million metics (some 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose council Cambaza ruled between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his reinstatement to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which claimed the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to relinquish his old post, as the company did not accomplish any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents don't care about the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish its director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards in view of the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate a disciplinary procedure against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently was silent and did not make appropriate legal action for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had to be served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company that he helped harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza would like to pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Refuted!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitons Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil, says the director does not have any morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza does not want to return to morality and serve the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served in the state itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjectives "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "c. in Burma" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely negative connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically evoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the word or have doubts about their use were censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings, which have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written in Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spider blower), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookier Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>

<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that she will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook needs to be more analytical before removing all posts that are suspected of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook won't delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the opposite words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech get a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "" "" "now it is time to cut off nationalism." ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to anyone spreading hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">Social networking experiences such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of slogans is often a cat and mouse game, using social networks simply to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook policy, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, post and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intent to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also appears as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "inheritance curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only had a little more respect for the 15 million use that gave them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts which did not contain any hate speech, but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married in 1997 from 1997 to 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements that were endeavoring to abolish laws on children's marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">However, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the draft law.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But early in 2017, the bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Senator Clarence Rambresat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After it was decided in the Senate before, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws on children's marriage had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who dresses a ministerial post at the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that disguised the heart of the matter, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel kept the opinion, it was definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was happy that the day had finally arrived:</seg>

<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take judicial steps if the law was adopted, and he seems to fulfil his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished to address the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather than talking about the problem, instead of talking about the problem, we would say that the state, which protects our daughters from being abused by large, hard-boiled men opposed to them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where child marriage in different gradations is legal or still the norm although there are laws that they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring websites, Turkish users can view Wikipedia content.</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrasting with the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright laws in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use conversion tools for blocked websites (a recent article by the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third largest VPN), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking items from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007 after the Internet law (no. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform is still locked, multiple mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia) are now surfaced.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform discovers all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its dedicated peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Despite legal prohibition, the content is available.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we all used to store snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was conducted independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorseite of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites if Wikipedia is locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported to Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices, as well as collaborators with Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL, which is not the original. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server further directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia, even if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A stirring rhinoceros, chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the banks of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in just a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was, and I immediately began kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood face to face with tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the humpman appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at us and he gazes at me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, mostly living in a tent to take photographs of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was re-released as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are avoiding women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to the social pressure they respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, preserve this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by a false court in the indian state of Odisha and expelled from her family and the village community after having contacted a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer allowances to fear, if at all they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs available in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working with her video camera for seven years on the disclosure of practices such as child marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and leads these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion consisted of women who did not call her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the discussion of the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To speak out loud the names of their husbands is a custom that they all perpetually maintain and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">What Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and desires a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">How to tell Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion club with this confidence in luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then they all asked," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can name us as they want, does it mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village Walhe in Maharashtra on breaking up a centuries-old tradition in which married women may never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">How to tell Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy, that during the whole exercise she chased away, and another decided to leave the whole strained frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in rush of adrenalin on having broken with an age-old custom, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Routes said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A participant in a participant was less understanding and the situation resulted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinnocent red dot on the forehead, which indicates the spouses:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnocent red dot if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped working, but they think they are in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discus club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunches and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to make sure who could hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to tell certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only wore saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them it's okay, but some wanted to wear a salsa-kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morality combined with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of kurtas (Oberhinden) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will get it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things start rolling slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "we have only taken small steps so far." ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tasted it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, still do it, but only if they are alone and are not members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discus club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a river that is difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos of stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"" "these stories are" "" "messages from those who experience them" "", "and offer a hyperlocal context to report global human rights and development challenges." ""</seg>

<seg id="1549">On the 29th of June this year, the hashtag was in the japanese Twitter trend, in which many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The Beatles visit in Japan in 1966 is regarded as the reversal of the Japanese culture of the post-war era.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in 1964 in London, noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just about five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">People here became clear very quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles commemoration day in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today, songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The Beatles kitsch survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is the Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "I don't know if this" "" "Winnie the Pooh" "" "doll John Lennon should represent or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese people naturally also make pilgrimages to the known places related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely must visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Matthew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>

<seg id="1568">5) (From Link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be whimsical enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is the Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Right now in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked across the Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same thing we did last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fan community with market-related products, like this Ramen shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!! today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could that be for a day?</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, probably for disbelieving purposes, worried the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and some of the organs were removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently declared that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There was a local superstition that the head of a bald man could contain gold or wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia said to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the target of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led the UN to conduct a mission in the South African country in order to examine this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange where killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police were already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also acknowledges the police of the Republic of Mozambique (PRM), according to which the victims in the head would have power to generate riches.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the detained Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years "imprisonment for" Subversion "(state danger) after he took part in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto that challenged democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and told a speaker that he deemed it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community to release Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have fully wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">Unified nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brenden refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was granted to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it had nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China, as exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Liu as she announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to impose all restrictions on Mr Lius's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad announced that the Americans "wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad, in so far as he can help him in his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the message asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to release his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US Embassy's call drew a furious response from China, with the statement of the Foreign Ministry that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told China that China should offer the following to the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany and Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hope that Liu "receives all the medical support he needs and that a humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping was released on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing by the news agency Reuters reported that China had great concerns about whether the fuss about Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide Liu an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP beforehand that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak and contact with someone outside, including his attorneys.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and freedom to exercise these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">In a declaration on 29 June, China's Foreign Ministry urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures need to be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there will be no further information whether France will ultimately take it up.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan and Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of continental affairs in Taiwan appealed to China on June 27 to release Liu and show greater tolerance to those who are campaigning for peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu Mei-nu, of the reigning Democratic Progressive Party, also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned about Liu on 28 June and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only Singapore political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Cavalierio blog accuses the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country, one hears that we are ultimately no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it seemed an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries," in view of this, it appeared invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are led permanently by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre is reappearing from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end the last week of Shanmugam was given responses to his American guests regarding our press, our judicative, our political system really not answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged the corresponding questions with non-answers rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to explain this point if he was paid highly in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just choices." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country" "", "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment with Shanmugam who, as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of Singapore political leaders, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is right and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "belive a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian spokesman?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet of government, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but don't they defend their city?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister need to pay back invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The magazine Journey of a Decade is tending to Bejahung, Singapore and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have annoyed many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with the rumors of certain parts of the world exposed and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification then follows the standard answer most of the time: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook inwardly with anger, if they are kept for Americans, but I don't mind that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know each other, there is little difference between Canadians and Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag well visible on their rucksack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">Everyone loves Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1768">First, being called "nice" means to be idle - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders of "The Simpsons" (who has its own Canadian Doppelgänger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can come across.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being inconspicuous and uninteresting and not paying attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major property of Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border of Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillenframe and gold coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people come in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">It's rather quiet at the moment, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also been sleeping outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy drugs that they cannot pay, she massages them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was a proper nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who is hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a normal first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and the Africans often travel the route together and that Africans are already speaking at Whatsapp from Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he answers smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez says that her guests often send their text messages when they have gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark hope for the migrants traveling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a blind alley leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family recorded migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to many African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled with his wife and three children in Honduras, who wanted to blackmail money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single woman, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, travellers should consult their telephones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. Ramírez seems to be happy that her house is full but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandma, she leaves with a lot of photos in her album.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair lichen, which she made a kundin, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users for the occasion of a high-cost operation.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10th, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan District of Urumqi issued a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Clean").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the authorities didn't have to use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app was investigating and prosecuting the sources and distribution channels of terrorists along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with minors is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can, of course, be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications about digital censorship in China most often focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those living in remote, troubled ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"" "the media outlet" "" "Images from mainland China" "", "which is based on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen were randomly checking the inhabitants to see if they had installed the surveillance app." ""</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile alert requested that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they might be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest-technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "also published a jingwang product description which indicates that the software can lift up the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions issued by the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, government and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi an ordinance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action infringes the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible crime rates, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2057">I enter the listening room and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he seems to me like that.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, despite the expressions that slide him: "my boy, you are still young, you can start much more important with your life than join these diaries and protest on demonstrations that will soon end up."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "" "" "I have grown accustomed to not answering." ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can no longer say exactly when insults and blows have become an ordinary communication tool for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"" "" "" "any voice in me told me that I had to get used to the punishment of being punished, even though I did nothing to deserve this punishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="2064">In all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to snatch as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner will delight in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold back your screams.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough for him, which is why they exchanged the pipe with a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest I asked if the investigator used to work as a garbage collector or if that belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables in order to present the great invention of a giant cable, from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them switched off while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner noticed the cooling and didn't really enjoy it, which is why he was next to an electrically charged bar.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flooded my entire body, enough to supply my entire neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My semi-naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to lie down again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">A few hours passed, which occurred to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call for the morning prayer.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emslam Hdaib smoked a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he slumbs to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as fellows (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as oriental racism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his way of thinking and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the disastrous consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't admit it openly, he has a special dislike against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian-winged second generation," he says himself, even though he was born in Jordan and never before was in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so, because I am a man," while he poured Nescafé in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan, during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with age-old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically speaking the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the wavy of the Kent-Cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"" "" "" "sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when looking at the neighbouring countries." ""</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan drinking water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, Jordan's Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert event.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and ex-press spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to "use" for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly clear, crystallizing reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib brought back traditional gender standards to Leibe by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch all the way up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years, the number of 'Ehrenmores' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outwardly left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honor murders in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is compounded that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime eradication from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from subjects that long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, he admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I was notified of politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are political in essence, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse repeats noticeably many times:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can "get what you want" - whether it is faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that commentaries on gender equality have been heavily censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online programme Roya, to note later that his comments were torn from context, twisted and censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a processed version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly promoting the Arab LGBTQ + community and advocates that intolerance to homosexuals does not entail Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nusomething, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwa, who was to work later on behalf of the caliphs, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemitian kingdom it is nothing new that the government sanctions attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service noted several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, stating that they have critically addressed the problems in social media that are related to corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordan.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that's how Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreams not only of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" "" "experience it" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached with a genuine and fundamental openness by music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial democracies. at least it hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore also resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebrasa in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebrasa festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is believed that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the prams, drums and dancing have been handed over for more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the West marched in the northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebrasa festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebraska Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep away the Peruvian youth from criminality and to promote a legitimate profession such as the hairdressers.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and therefore the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to the fact that more and more regular citizens venture into the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts are competing against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in the barber art, which enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year commencing in March and reported some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because out of love for the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the" "" "love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea AfterTwelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important to accommodate people who feel rejected?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly what prompted the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Carta por la lliación (letters to reconciliation).</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), forming the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International recognition of the treaty was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombians lies a long way, until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, who have been subjected to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now integrate into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against guerrilla fighters, must now take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians should unite and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He was planning to share his love with people this year, needing the most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former warriors of the FARC, who now have their place in society and have to build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is prepared to make the discourse of a war history a common history of peace," she says.</seg>
<seg id="2199">To date, more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manicales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN shelters in the region of Caldono-Cauca on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo, from the BogotArt Foundation, travelled to the camp to personally hand over the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC established themselves as they had done earlier in order to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between," the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later told.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had handed over the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life somebody wrote something like that, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he too was tired of the war, he was tired of being the faithful companion of this combatant all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else of life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society there, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC already acted in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore the leaders of the FARC announced the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice on the part of the State affected the whole Columbian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a target of this magnitude, it is worth overcoming all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard of hearing and had no suffrage, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate, were only people with beautiful feelings surrounded by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors have replied to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger, and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to resort to weapons, rise and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call upon all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be facing many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2266">I just know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had taken everything along and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had summoned an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which patient wings were you laid - in which of the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there's still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name on his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me with respect.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I was threatened with threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya in order to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They asked me that I had to prove it by walking up without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my gender that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have particle size C - what would I have to say on television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family manage to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window stood a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened the third time it became clear to me that there was something lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "right now, when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe, you're safe, just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it's the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender balance, that's a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still wear some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I actually try to figure out how the person looks out to whom she remembers from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that no people were arrested and tortured during Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">This is what I mean, they are probably charging their relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" has been experienced by blood.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there aren't many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped from their relatives in order to make Cadyrow's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are recorded there so that one can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people had not simply disappeared, they were deliberately immersed in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown their beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was by himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, but there have not been reports before. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already happened in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think it was already before 2003 that I was already known in Grozny when I was living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>

<seg id="2354">The security department of Sharia has never harmed me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>

<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period stop?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - one could sense how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic worsened steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what are your activities now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I won't cents for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I clapped a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddab item?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alber.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Nature has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to make you white with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no bobbins with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan have which, the Cabins, have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet there are - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who walk to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think about identity at men who love men, and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a sharp increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jasim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who are working in Ahwaz want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video that was shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could no longer do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights told that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - got caught up.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: all the family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families on the grounds of persecution by the Iranian government, were helpless and unable to follow safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, located in the Arab-Arab community living in Iran, has been shattered by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the indigenous Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy conquered power and assumed great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often a victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and privations.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime has systematically denied the Ahwazi-Arabs work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arab areas to the Persian territory, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by dryness, and destroying the local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi young now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian director general for cooperation, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, 55% completed a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">As functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their native Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone Arabic language or carrying Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi must endure, human rights activists are beating alarm before the situation will explosively.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world will wake up and take note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website Afroféminas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves an intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even present well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, today, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they can do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on gender still draws across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am suffering doubly and threefold underneath.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">Yet, if I get to speak on skin color, on racism, on black women's women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the diaspora; if I mention what kind of body we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, decide not to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my lord "to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of institutionalised violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as the school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of experiencing domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't join a movement in whose centre stands the white woman who refuses to take account of injustice in her mind, which refers both to gender as well as to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "in 1851, sojourner complained:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a fragmented and marginalized." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which also by cultural appropriation absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to dissociate myself fully from feminism and join the movement of Womanismus, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can stand up to black women and women of other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life neither bypassed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSermujer (# weightfully efraubin), which reports on the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-husband, who had become violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman appeared in Balbuena because of ill-treatment, Ada Báez did not see anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women pay an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to the law enforcement authorities at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Contents1 blows and statistics 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that is nothing inferior to 3 Paraguays: good approach, inadequate implementation of blows and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research facility in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports which, however, do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 cases of domestic violence were reported to the District Attorney Office. 70% of this was violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 indications for domestic violence in peace courses. 86% of women's advertisements were also found here.</seg>

<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she wore psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of ill-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happened to women who are too subservient because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming a name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had so long left Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>

<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Gentile Weniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law stipulates that Femizid should be declared an independent criminal offence and to punish severely as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">In this way, the legislative text has been modified in a number of ways in order to win the deputies of the law, who feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions was banned, which is currently prohibited in Paraguay and is punishable by up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to cost much of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence currently have to bear, if they simply wish to refund and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri is arguing that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethinking has to take place so that violence is no longer regarded as normal.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Image by his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out locally: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines lacking in the global healthcare system that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists will help build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus, before he decided to go back home to support the Sámi Healthcare system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samba national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>

<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain a receiver instead of being a maker.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to return or relocate here, as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines can only make articles accessible for payment (called" "" "Paywall" "" "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salad in the US since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrageous, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents prove not only for individual varieties but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or crooked leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants, such as crop or carton varieties. plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but it now takes longer since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river there is a boulder to which I have to ride." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">"" "and if they stand before the courts, no one can breed a new type of salad, because all the characteristics are already patented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and tries to use no material protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined forces in the United States and around the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source Seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative called Ossi, US breeders may commit themselves to free use of the seeds they have bred.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who purchase their seeds to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Since its launch in 2014, dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are in control of the seed and the ability to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger cohesion such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the open-source movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seed," the recent examples of the amalgamation of ChemChina and Syngenta and Bayer, as it is offered in August and September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to keeping their seed available free of charge, as opposed to using seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is unceasingly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights available on plant material.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all card features are protected as intellectual property, which makes it difficult for plant breeders to be used either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that plants that have been grown larger than wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit targeted traits - from those that improve their taste or colour to such as they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics point out that the available plant material for breeders devotes more and more patents. at present, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the modified conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "it contradicts the notion that intellectual property" "" "encourage other breeders" "", "as" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that anyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it different: waiting for 20 years until a patent falls, certainly not promoting innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow crops that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to be: "independent breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us forward and it will be impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total, Morton is bothered by the concept of patenting plant features:" "" "we don't really create the features ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make up for themselves and as breeders we have no idea how plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "if you breed a variety, you also breed its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are required for their cultivation of mass herbicides, which breed into its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such who operate in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) have patents, they create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks as though I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties for a few years, "he says." with a patent they are protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it quite simple in my opinion. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be leading in open source breeding, the concept is rapidly spreading throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open source seed seed programme." to preserve the seed of traditional crop varieties, the Centre collaborates with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Organization Agrecol is working on an open source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or in other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">In early November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, has declared that conventionally cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest censorship objectives in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANGEI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt as well as the Arab world and reports about them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained intact despite this attack and the ridicule of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, so it has never been as important as it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arabic-speaking issue of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human Rights Organization of the wave of web-side barriers to the victim. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada no more access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog to spread columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to bypass the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider on which also Ziadas blog is home, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting on the student protests and recording a video, as the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada said to the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although the blogging of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, summons by the National Security Council, the blogging blog and any other web page I was working for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, however, after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave will go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked access to 133 sites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers, through the circumvention of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice suggests the intention of the government to further block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can act against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government willing to go to censorship and who will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian Army in the Favelas in Niterói, a city in Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo of: Estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in Brazil are reporting with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the country's second largest city and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assassinated," "Thieves robbed dispensary with military weapons," "President Timer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air port to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 has reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For example, the newspaper "Extra" published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial "This is not normal" in which she announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that is deviated from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: it's not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubric in a country that doesn't know the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Inner Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 domains that are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions to cover up.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war" is arguing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as has been shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historic and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: Rio de Janeiro State is larger than its capital.</seg>
<seg id="2775">A peace march in Niterói in Rio de Janeiro in honour of the murdered cultural organiser Rafael.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">To designate Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," says Cecília: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at morphologies per federal state, Rio is at number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">It is owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília emphasizes, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by Rio in 2003, whose goal is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police service and permanently stationing a unit.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not meet the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the designation "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also drags serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways that are typical of a war. this includes entering the territory of a "enemy" where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week now, the police have climbed the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident made headlines: an orchard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities face brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians, is particularly affected.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpetrated.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel controlled areas have stood under siege outside Damascus, causing local residents to rely on locally produced or through tunnels and control points of smuggled food.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas to plant their own mushrooms as "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">Direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed its relief that it gains more and more awareness. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to teach 125 families to grow mushrooms, said Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of about €12,700, but will continue to collect donations to Cando by Monday, 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the propellant shortage, locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said global voices that they began with the" "" "production of fungal seeds from the regions" "" "before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>
<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "" "" "we want to teach people the cultivation of mushrooms for various reasons" "" ": breaking the siege." ""</seg>

<seg id="2832">Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017</seg>
<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant up in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government proclaimed a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in Galicia in Spain where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread to the north and centrally located regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande where there were 64 fatalities and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite recordings, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"" "" "" "the government led a loosening of the law allowing construction activity to fall if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open back door, so that everything could be built," "" "says João Sorval in the same article of the newspaper Público." ""</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environment organisation Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily inflammable wood, spread out, as in a vicious circle, according to fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when residents sought information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that supplied the population with information: it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the fire brigade work and this fateful weekend in October was so crucial that the servers didn't stand up to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2873">In one night in the autumn of 1994, the conquest of Afghanistan by the Taliban began.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years earlier, a terrible civil war broke out between the various mujahedin groups that had defeated the short-lived pro-Soviet government. thus, Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">Right at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy, who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, spent the last time together with his family at dinner in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even though his mother didn't say it at that time, she knew that she wouldn't see her son very long - maybe never again.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hesara-e-Wahdat party, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf re-found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wages and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged bags with mortars that were heavier than himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service and no heating there. we hung nylon before the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf abandoned his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, walking alone through the streets of Rome, sleeping in parks and walking to a church that distributed food to those in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high earning quotas, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country find are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and untrained personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be admitted to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can still go for months after the application of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also called Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unrestrained desire of life helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that he opened a second hostel and fast food after a while.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, about 20,000 people in Italy live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the companies operating in Afghanistan have sprung up, including dressmaking, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharan's targets, however, reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy and retail trade and aim to return to the country that it forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also makes plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and finishing techniques. "this is how they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stands stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Citizen report: legal drafts from Egypt facilitate the shutdown of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for over 900 days in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearance of the Raba'a el Adaweya camp in Cairo, which protested against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo by @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and upcoming trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">In order to be able to use social networks, users must register within six months following a successful law decision on the website of the authority, indicating their full name and identification number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed to take this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the termination of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty members of the Parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another member of parliament submitted a proposal to introduce stricter punishments for the insult of the president or a senior civil servant.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the insulting of the President as well as state institutions is punishable already. however, under the legislative proposal, such a crime would be punishable by prison and fines, as judicial experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be adopted, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly would have been in danger anyway for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against protesters demonstrating for the inauguration of the elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting, like more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested at the same incident, four years in prison for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison management failed to bring the accused to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan faces the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, modestly burden of inter alia, weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza spoke to the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi sitting block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishment of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activist interrogated to doctored documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan explicitly endorsed a controversial draft bill that would grant business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, if they return all unlawfully preserved funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document released on April 21, on the website of Nawaat, sheds light on how the presidential plans look for the support of the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia denied the mention of his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which reassures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, at the District Court in Tunis, on 9 May, he witnessed in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China force the users of social media to show their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Information Office of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the Regulations it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that this will prevent the elimination of anonymous comments into conversations within social networks. up to now it is unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to only selectively enforce these rules in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia closed Russia's access to the latest Chinese Messaging App WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Rosweinadzor, WeChat missed to register with the provincial government as" "" "organiser of information broadening" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law of 2014, thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the publication of information. "the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and forcing them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Websites such as Vkontakte and Odnogorniki (Russia's two popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services are currently on these websites.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has locking Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ruled the Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to extinguish two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site was blocked because it became" "" "a source of information that collaborates with groups to create a political diffamination campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey totally blocks the website. it is thus, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop chilling out</seg>
<seg id="2968">Once this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence agencies on the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. responses and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
