this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally transferred to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified risks and called upon him to name his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they give .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en lived at risk to go to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they say for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped at Ris@@ en .
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly obtained his telephone references secretly ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit agreement , and even travel notes with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ otto .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers at his arrival , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary convic@@ ted more than all U.S. governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional amend@@ ment , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can take it from the moment they get in touch , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet been written when Ris@@ en wrote his book and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available in advance .
but Sec@@ ure@@ drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments all over the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have the possibility of doing wrong . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
or the next environmental employee who warns the poll@@ uted water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden huge sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous enterprise . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already lead to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box firms in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a trail of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nerv@@ ously waiting for the next release , and on the next disclosed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent ller or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is that when the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians , as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few are used to hide and veil their fortun@@ es -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ch@@ cap@@ u@@ ppe .
you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter .
presumably because so far there have been no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans who are hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but through the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , in some US states you need less information , you need to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US allows employees of bor@@ ou@@ ghs to rip school@@ children off .
it has allowed che@@ aters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us that everyone except a lawyer made proposals to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single peak politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very stub@@ born as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite well that some things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years , we have seen suggestions for greater transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has recorded in central registers on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress that we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama expos@@ ures , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment of change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy to stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally stop the in@@ transparency that now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after completing my design studies , I made a sale of the farm .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stood still and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me enthusias@@ tically how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go for peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get into my bed ?
a wild stranger is sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , cute on tips at the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my perspective .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something to do this . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese plat@@ ter om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and me star@@ ed .
did we just discover that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ mar@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website that people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , the type of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet , they invite wild people to stay overnight .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that permits strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you are focused on the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we strive for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left @-@ seated neighbors .
this soft touch of panic you &apos;ll feel now -- -- is just what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just like that , who actually has Al G@@ ores mobile phone now ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the office of the President ?
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name ; if he had told where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really capture very well un@@ locked cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system rein@@ forces confidence .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their jud@@ gements before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we studied how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust people most , who are the most like .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing will change .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stem@@ med from com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you won &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- I won &apos;t accept the request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great artwork in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
three things can be recognized .
first of all : incredible good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been covered in advance .
for us , the business runs very well .
of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to be celebrated or homes rav@@ aged .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays booked only a fraction of the problem .
for people have trusted one another .
if trust works , it can create wonderful things .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who are inclined to heart attacks due to sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know it correctly .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
they allow you to stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
this way , of course , every stay does not exp@@ ire .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing coinci@@ de with monetary transactions ?
it is an economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now simply call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade promising human relationships .
people make a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare this with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show you a quarter of a pub that you &apos;ve never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we wanted to create apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing ?
I imagine cities that enable society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul , this project has already begun .
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a stay ,
were given to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programs were started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be host to a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also hospitality in advance .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why exactly did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted stere@@ otypes .
I find this amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes me .
of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
or supp@@ resses , bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you blame for your negative impressions .
in this way , the media are people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a se@@ ag@@ ull fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I decided to ou@@ te myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you supp@@ ressing yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , compared to the pressure I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only passed the faith of my parents pas@@ sively .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet loves you ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started as all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eil@@ een &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jump@@ ed out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should I do something like that ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... , ... &quot; D@@ ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others have turned me into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember -- as we drove sil@@ ently -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time dre@@ aded to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islam@@ ist organizations , which said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed there all week .
then it was Friday this week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warning was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were considered to be Muslims , dra@@ gged out and struck them .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it &apos;s the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , sa@@ vi@@ ors and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces available , but do not stop the terror .
regular visits to a mos@@ que tend to look more tolerant towards people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as I told me a head of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently : people are actually not being radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
in the ra@@ dic@@ alization process , it has been established that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts of the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor or rejected by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imag@@ inations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology grounds on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when one looks at them , they do not drive on what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holy scrip@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which they can read into the scrip@@ tures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she intended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , forced her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something given to their anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to have a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian system of government , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when people present messages in which negative opinions were reported to Muslims , they were more likely to resort to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of American Muslims &apos; rights .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood sw@@ aps against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it the first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
when it comes to assign@@ ing collective guilt it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was at the dental Fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , has murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision as it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we opted for the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we went silent , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , put off my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the assembled believers were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
in that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had taken courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind factory , an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then the rule has often been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire store .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for industrial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air package delivery penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting aircraft , aircraft reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of space .
you can also build resili@@ ent structures independently .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively , where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands exist at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
unlike most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter .
one such question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft flying only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ in , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only one mo@@ ve@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no valves , hing@@ es and cross ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is quite simple , the inner life happens so much so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starter . to make it flying , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right when all of you watch is low , so I show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the mon@@ osp@@ in is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the coach with his eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this excess ?
they see that he is aesthe@@ tically symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , it receives the proper capacity ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it rot@@ ates or even rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is imagin@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let us look at this .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other counter @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller fails , the electronics or a battery - the machine can continue to fly , albeit constra@@ ined .
we will now demonstrate this by fli@@ ght@@ less of one @-@ half .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations encourage you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine on the street wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creatures to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed around each other in a very far remote gal@@ axy , so the mass of three suns transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all the stars along in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not use their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was em@@ itted into space @-@ time fabric itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange the events .
1.3 billion years ago , a number of cel@@ i@@ cel@@ tic lives were created on Earth .
since then , the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing at -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are formed by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following years , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which greatly improved the detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes were scre@@ aming through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my death @-@ sick father .
basically , these were the fruits of my life &apos;s work .
all that I had worked for is no longer Science Fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years and their signals through observ@@ atories such as lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cir@@ cling in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched into one direction and compressed into the other .
lec@@ turers teach in courses for rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a really alpine dance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and st@@ owing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and pun@@ ched at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . that &apos;s why the Lig@@ o employees were declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer @-@ long laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties of building such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are resour@@ ceful and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
it is different in the case of sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you :
for example , your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now Alice is talking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ b Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can hear the universe literally .
the gravity to listen , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has already occupied himself very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very fast , one hears the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of sound &#93; Som@@ ebody knows what to listen to , recognize this as a noise of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun mass , which turn approximately as quickly as the sticks of your mixer .
AA : just think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens up a completely new way to explore the universe as never before has been possible .
on this path we can hear the All @-@ listen and the In@@ visible .
much in space we can not see -- practical or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot from them about space .
the exciting physical processes happen at the heart , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these are opa@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own light shining .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see and of whom we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the suction cups for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a totally different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to everything I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me in unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , I removed my fear .
my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way . it started with a question of my smallest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak alley . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from that moment on , I am always bo@@ thered to play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very proud .
it has a magic effect on me , on my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -@@ say to playing with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things happen , wake up to life .
dream job .
no .
I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I do television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are at the same time in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three programs simultaneously in production , four episodes of : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not only produced , so on top of all . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who else does it ?
no one , so I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you &apos;re running a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I talk about work so you understand that I don &apos;t just run around on the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that dream job is not about dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is like I set troops when I painted on a canvas .
as if you make a high sound , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the hum@@ ming .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I explain to them the bu@@ zz that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing is a pleasure for me .
don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what she does .
but the hum@@ ming -- when I began to work and work and to work and work , create , create , and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the tot@@ als are more than writing .
the hum@@ ming is action and activity . the hum@@ ming is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a h@@ um then you can &apos;t strive other than great@@ ness .
the feeling of not being different than striving for great@@ ness , no matter what price .
this is called sum@@ ming .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to tell you I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
in order to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more connected boundaries , the more work there are , the more things are observed at the same time , the more I write history , the more my expectations are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the h@@ um , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this h@@ um . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the hum@@ ming . I am the hum@@ ming .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom@@ my is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write to my anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ ming ceased .
the bu@@ zz of the engine stopped .
I no longer loved my work . the engine was off .
the hum@@ ming did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , doesn &apos;t give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the hum@@ ming I was .
so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ y@@ ls you , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you are working , you love what you do , be a teacher , to be a bank@@ ers , to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one to the hum@@ ming when you know the h@@ um , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out late , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no when two things become aware :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she does not call anyone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my bu@@ zz is smoking , and here everything changes from my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of the sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl is letting go of in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I am breathing .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sum@@ ming , but a hum@@ ming .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of money , the titanium dioxide , this is just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using shows and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
h@@ um is not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream that comes from the z@@ est of life .
true sum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me I &apos;m a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it &apos;s a law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t care how to work like that .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person is working better than being a home ?
well , I do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe are full of me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you &apos;ll be nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or cookie will replace me .
and if my teen@@ ager speaks to me for a whole 15 minutes , I am mother of the year .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on stage , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes by piece !
no cell@@ phone , no washing , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to bed .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my fe@@ eb@@ le , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s all about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and preserve it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;ll be victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes to the tune , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the hum@@ ming came back in my spare time . the hum@@ ming then seems to return when I do not work .
working is not working without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the hum@@ ming is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the tot@@ als of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s gon@@ na happen to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the luck@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the hum@@ ming , the bu@@ zz , the other , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life is spreading within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things out , I wake you to life .
that &apos;s part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , an electrode is im@@ planted in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain in the skull @-@ brain trauma and increases the pressure of the skull .
to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull .
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted cells to grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families .
you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the environment to thri@@ ve it .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts Jean @-@ François has succeeded .
he saw this under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly disper@@ sed and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ ach@@ ine @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the fold of the brain .
but why are they left to us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries .
but this is not so sure .
one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it was done by Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re @-@ recru@@ ited them to the tak@@ eover of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ reim@@ port these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ reim@@ port the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler &apos;s help , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we re @-@ imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely , as if they were taken back , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we color in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we injured the motor motor sector in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen to people , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the aid of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkeys .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left @-@ hand side , they see the monkey collecting spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now you see when we reim@@ plant@@ ate the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate them in human beings .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely do .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one has to fill approximately two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes for someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to do the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it really is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and an impressive growth while politics is completely un@@ democratic .
democracy in fact disappears with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clari@@ fied as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- would not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at that moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ y@@ est friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mi@@ tig@@ ated , our future is glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to inform you of an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is part of the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , who are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and income to produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth produced , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lions of US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks which cannot be offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand which , as in a continuous loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , as in a final loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of the investors in which they do not invest .
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances causing o@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my rowing with capitalism --
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents , and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally ended too many .
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which granted them the right to political participation with equal voting rights in questions of state inc@@ iner@@ ation .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that lights up very bright , it is burned out quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our modern liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies have not their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations - became a democr@@ ati@@ zed zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place by gradually sett@@ ling politics and em@@ power@@ ing them .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not up to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today in the government it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power is ander@@ ed from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my rowing with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably decim@@ ated the animals from which it nour@@ ishes , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has har@@ med politicians so far that they themselves are har@@ med by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality falls , the overall economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look particularly well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem here is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the extravag@@ ance of sub@@ lime , and social conflicts deeper , just as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
we need to re@@ arrange the economy and re@@ unite the fields of business and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a disease @-@ arrest hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has brought forth .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are used in the research of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks about the meaning of life .
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ style Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then all income from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing , and the concept of wage labour , is completely over@@ taken .
no distinction between those who belong to companies but who do not work therein , and employees who work there , but who do not belong to . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no raised twin peaks .
in the sphere of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 &#93; key emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time liberal , in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ n@@ esi@@ anische .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
in your biography you describe yourself as a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it currently , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : it &apos;s a very Greek one , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the or@@ ators you said very clearly what you consider from the west &apos;s point of view on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of the world plays itself -- the realm of the economy -- is a fully democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I may say this pro@@ voc@@ atively , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to acc@@ use China now to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century smells enormous in hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good @-@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency and the permanent denial that a massive fault line has passed through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this denial -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro zone , continue to choose denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , one might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what are the changes ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
if there is a finance minister or minister who claims to be in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has not made any mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to overthrow our government only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one from the tro@@ ika that imposed this policy on us conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if it does not survive , the un@@ released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 what it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for visiting TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most have never heard before , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hair@@ cut and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy does not select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right hand side of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB site . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this rating will receive .
if your show is rated at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think one needs special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average exc@@ itation , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they just don &apos;t am@@ a@@ ze .
so he has to make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch each for free .
and if Amazon gives out things for free , do you get up , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they are watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you skip over or look at once again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it a bit differently .
instead of hosting a contest , he and his team have watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers so the reviews they give the shows their history , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x then landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
there are two very competitive , data @-@ sealed companies .
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
the least what can be expected is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone in the U.S. is in jail and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that it could predict out@@ breaks from flu , the aw@@ ful way , by data analysis of the Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year round year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these mistakes , data stream rapidly into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use many data uni@@ mag@@ inable to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do princip@@ ally two things :
first , you dis@@ assemble this problem into your items , so you can analyse the items ; as a double , put the items back together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to break down a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts , put it together again and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; that was not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they contest TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This tells us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the tool for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will challenge it later with a technical demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , with which I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with something much wis@@ er than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will become smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data , it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
