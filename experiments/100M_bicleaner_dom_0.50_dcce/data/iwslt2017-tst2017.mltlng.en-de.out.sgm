<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally transferred to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has identified risks and called upon him to name his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 Risen lived at risk to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they say for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped at Risen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and risking to make statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, secretly obtained his telephone references secretly,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, financial and bank information, his credit agreement, and even travel notes with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risotto.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers at his arrival, but instead the judiciary convicted more than all U.S. governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional amendment, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can take it from the moment they get in touch, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet been written when Risen wrote his book and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is Securedrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available in advance.</seg>
<seg id="36">But Securedrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments all over the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardise all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important for us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have the possibility of doing wrong. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental employee who warns the polluted water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leak of history was published.] [Panama Papers "revealed that rich and powerful] have hidden huge sums of money in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous enterprise. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already lead to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox firms in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a trail of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervously waiting for the next release, and on the next disclosed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent ller or a John Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is that when the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians, as secret tax havens of some few are used to hide and veil their fortunes -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matryoshchcapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">You have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because so far there have been no prominent Americans who came to this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "now it's not that there are no rich Americans who are hiding their fortunes in tax havens." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states you need less information, you need to provide less information to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US allows employees of boroughs to rip schoolchildren off.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigation into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator turned out to be an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked us that everyone except a lawyer made proposals to our investigator how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single peak politician, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very stubborn as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite well that some things have begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "in the past few years, we have seen suggestions for greater transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU has recorded in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind it.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress that we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama exposures, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness this is a moment of change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy to stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can finally stop the intransparency that now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after completing my design studies, I made a sale of the farm.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stood still and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me enthusiastically how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go for peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage compartment!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I get into my bed?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, cute on tips at the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my perspective.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could make something to do this. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure that our cheese platter omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and me stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Did we just discover that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blemarczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website that people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, the type of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they invite wild people to stay overnight.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that permits strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you are focused on the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left-seated neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic you'll feel now -- -- is just what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidates for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first introduced himself to his name; if he had told where he came from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 assessments that all say: "he can really capture very well unlocked cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system reinforces confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their judgements before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we studied how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust people most, who are the most like.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing will change.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stemmed from commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you buy.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, such as" "" "Hi!" "", "you won't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "you tell too much, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother -- -- -- I won't accept the request." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "" "Great artwork in your apartment! I make holidays with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to put down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">Three things can be recognized.</seg>
<seg id="197">First of all: incredible good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been covered in advance.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to be celebrated or homes ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays booked only a fraction of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people have trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, it can create wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who are inclined to heart attacks due to sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know it correctly.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They allow you to stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">This way, of course, every stay does not expire.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing coincide with monetary transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now simply call" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade promising human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People make a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare this with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show you a quarter of a pub that you've never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we wanted to create apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital, Seoul, this project has already begun.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be host to a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality in advance.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why exactly did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted stereotypes.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppresses, brainwashing, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">In this way, the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people don't talk with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A seagull fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I decided to oute myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear the hijab my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why are you suppressing yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a declaration of independence for me, compared to the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passed the faith of my parents passively.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever had the feeling that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet loves you?</seg>

<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."...,... "Djihad..."... "" bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu, the deeds of others have turned me into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember -- as we drove silently -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time dreaded to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were considered to be Muslims, dragged out and struck them.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>

<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, saviors and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces available, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque tend to look more tolerant towards people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I told me a head of the police in the Washington DC area, DC recently: people are actually not being radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, it has been established that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists of the extremists believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or rejected by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imaginations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "both groups claim their ideology grounds on their" "" "holy book" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when one looks at them, they do not drive on what they read in their" "" "holy scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, which they can read into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she intended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke, forced her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something given to their anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised to have a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways of real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show that if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when people present messages in which negative opinions were reported to Muslims, they were more likely to resort to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of American Muslims' rights.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood swaps against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it the first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When it comes to assigning collective guilt it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was at the dental Faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such an accomplished young man from my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, has murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon.</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision as it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely.</seg>
<seg id="382">We opted for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat we went silent, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, put off my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of the assembled believers were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had taken courage and compassion to panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with a draught, working in a noble mind factory, an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as ordinary as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">If you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people seem like an exception to rule, then the rule has often been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire store.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for industrial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package delivery penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting aircraft, aircraft reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest of space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build resilient structures independently.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to function autonomously, it must know collectively, where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands exist at the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most starters, it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the aircraft does not matter in which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft flying only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospin, the mechanically simple remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moveable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No valves, hinges and cross rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is quite simple, the inner life happens so much so that it can fly stable and can move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starter. to make it flying, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right when all of you watch is low, so I show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospin is an exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the coach with his eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this excess?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is aesthetically symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, it receives the proper capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it rotates or even rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is imaginable in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other counter-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery - the machine can continue to fly, albeit constrained.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by flightless of one-half.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration will examine synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations encourage you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine on the street wants to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent creatures to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled around each other in a very far remote galaxy, so the mass of three suns transformed into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit more brightly than all the stars along in all galaxies of the entire known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not use their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was emitted into space-time fabric itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, a number of celiceltic lives were created on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing at -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are formed by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser interferometer gravitational-waves-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following years, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which greatly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes were screaming through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, these were the fruits of my life's work.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has studied gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years and their signals through observatories such as ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a circling in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched into one direction and compressed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Lecturers teach in courses for relativity-theory often a really alpine dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"" "" "" "stretching and dusting, stretching and stowing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and punched at the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. that's why the Ligo employees were declared crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer-long laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length would have to be measured at less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties of building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are resourceful and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different in the case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">This is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now Alice is talking." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dumb Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has already occupied himself very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies turn very fast, one hears the same circus with an additional key change. that sounds like wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrender of sound] Somebody knows what to listen to, recognize this as a noise of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun mass, which turn approximately as quickly as the sticks of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: just think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens up a completely new way to explore the universe as never before has been possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can hear the All-listen and the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can not see -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot from them about space.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes happen at the heart, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is covered by its own light shining.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly, I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see and of whom we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, as Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the suction cups for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a totally different perspective on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year I would say" "" "Yes" "" "to everything I was afraid of." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, I removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way. it started with a question of my smallest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kitten" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak alley." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from that moment on, I am always bothered to play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very proud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magic effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">"" "but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the" "" "yes" "" "-say to playing with my children saved my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am a writer. I think things happen, wake up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for taking 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are at the same time in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three programs simultaneously in production, four episodes of: grey's, 21 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not only produced, so on top of all. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, so I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you're running a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I talk about work so you understand that I don't just run around on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I don't understand that dream job is not about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is like I set troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you make a high sound, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the humming.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain to them the buzz that I'm talking about writing that writing is a pleasure for me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, that's what she does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the humming -- when I began to work and work and to work and work, create, create, and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The totals are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The humming is action and activity. the humming is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a hum then you can't strive other than greatness.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for greatness, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called summing.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"" "" "" "I just know that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz." ""</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more connected boundaries, the more work there are, the more things are observed at the same time, the more I write history, the more my expectations are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the hum, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this hum. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the humming. I am the humming.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overloaded, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mommy is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write to my anny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the summing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my work. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The humming did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, a Titan does not sleep, doesn't give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showcase-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the humming I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "hayls you, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you do it, you are working, you love what you do, be a teacher, to be a bankers, to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one to the humming when you know the hum, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern states waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out late, late and she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no when two things become aware:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "kitten" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she does not call anyone" "" "kitten" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my buzz is smoking, and here everything changes from my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and lack of the summing, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl is letting go of in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I am breathing.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the summing, but a humming.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of money, the titanium dioxide, this is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using shows and TV-hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">Hum is not a force and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True summing is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me I'm a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It's a law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't care how to work like that.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person is working better than being a home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I do.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totals of the universe are full of me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you'll be naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It's only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at the most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or cookie will replace me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And if my teenager speaks to me for a whole 15 minutes, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It's only 15 minutes, more does not need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on stage, even in a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes by piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No cellphone, no washing, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to bed.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my feeble, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is necessary to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's all about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to" "" "play" "" "in general." ""</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The humming came back in my spare time. the humming then seems to return when I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the humming, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the humming is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The humming of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's gonna happen to me that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, an electrode is implanted in the brain in order to influence the circuits of the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that the brain swells the brain in the skull-brain trauma and increases the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted cells to grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity and the environment to thrive it.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts Jean-François has succeeded.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly dispersed and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doubleachine-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebellar cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the fold of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they left to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it was done by Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we re-recruited them to the takeover of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-reimport these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-reimport the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller's help, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-imported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they were taken back, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and reimplantated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained intact -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we color in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we injured the motor motor sector in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the aid of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left-hand side, they see the monkey collecting spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we reimplantate the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate them in human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely do.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results one has to fill approximately two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes for someone to come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to do the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it really is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a flourishing capitalism and an impressive growth while politics is completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Democracy in fact disappears with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clarified as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- would not affect the austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my soyest friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are mitigated, our future is gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to inform you of an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin peaks paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is part of the wealthy depositors and corporations, who are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and income to produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth produced, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillions of US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compares it with the $5.1 trillion dollars, which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks which cannot be offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand which, as in a continuous loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, which, as in a final loop, encourages the pessimism of the investors in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances causing oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my rowing with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents, and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally ended too many.</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to reduce the value of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which granted them the right to political participation with equal voting rights in questions of state incineration.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights up very bright, it is burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our modern liberal democracies have not their roots in ancient Athens," ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations - became a democratized zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies, since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place by gradually settling politics and empowering them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today in the government it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power is andered from politics to the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my rowing with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals from which it nourishes, that they end up starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has harmed politicians so far that they themselves are harmed by the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality falls, the overall economic demand falls and the directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "the more successful capitalism drives the" "" "demos" "" "out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we must reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look particularly well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem here is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the extravagance of sublime, and social conflicts deeper, just as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">We need to rearrange the economy and reunite the fields of business and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a disease-arrest hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has brought forth.</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines are used in the research of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks about the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -style Utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and redeeming, and the concept of wage labour, is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to companies but who do not work therein, and employees who work there, but who do not belong to. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no raised twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the sphere of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20] key emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberal, in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, globally keynesianische.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">In your biography you describe yourself as a libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand what Larry Summers calls "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next as we experience it currently, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: it's a very Greek one, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the orators you said very clearly what you consider from the west's point of view on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of the world plays itself -- the realm of the economy -- is a fully democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I may say this provocatively, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">To accuse China now to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century smells enormous in hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guessed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "namely to say good-bye to the complacency and the permanent denial that a massive fault line has passed through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">"" "" "" "we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --" ""</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro zone, continue to choose denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, one might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what are the changes ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everybody who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or minister who claims to be in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has not made any mistake, then it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to overthrow our government only because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "it's worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "no one from the troika that imposed this policy on us confessed:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the euro zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the unreleased centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the path of a post-modern 1930 what it seems to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for visiting TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most have never heard before, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has a haircut and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "movies, TV, technique, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy does not select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right hand side of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB site. the rating is from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this rating will receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bad" "", "" "" "Game of Thrones" "", "" "" "The Wire" "" "-- all the shows that are addictive, your brain asks:" "" "where are there more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think one needs special intelligence to underline" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average excitation, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't amaze.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he has to make sure he's really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time Amazon is doing such a thing, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he stops a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch each for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives out things for free, do you get up, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skip over or look at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this is the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it a bit differently.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of hosting a contest, he and his team have watched the existing data on the Netflix viewers so the reviews they give the shows their history, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix then landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">There are two very competitive, data-sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this about?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least what can be expected is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit frightening, because we live in a time when we use more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone in the U.S. is in jail and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that it could predict outbreaks from flu, the awful way, by data analysis of the Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year round year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes, data stream rapidly into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use many data unimaginable to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do principally two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, you disassemble this problem into your items, so you can analyse the items; as a double, put the items back together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break down a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision - especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts, put it together again and make a show like "House of Cards," that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first when they contest TV ideas, then when they chose" "" "Alpha House" "" "as a show." ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say," "" "This tells us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the tool for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, with which I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you want to replace them with something much wiser than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will become smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data, it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
