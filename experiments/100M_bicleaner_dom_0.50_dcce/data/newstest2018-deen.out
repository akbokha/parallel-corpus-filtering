Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , who had to get upset before , because the car Nav@@ i instead of a stra@@ ined road showed a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bayern of the state government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date , but it is therefore very enligh@@ tening .
especially when comparing them with current online tickets .
then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
in the large map of the map , more detailed maps were incorporated into cities and municipalities , so @-@ called documents .
these were created according to the specifications of the Bavarian sur@@ veying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops ended with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max . Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / present is most impressive , for example , by the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as the Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming a smaller @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand @-@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ als &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no more farmers there , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the place of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the original position , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one not only reads the street name &quot; am Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here on the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ Institution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was founded in 18@@ 58 / 59 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought in connection with King Ludwig II &apos;s death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , finished the accus@@ ations of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the County re@@ unification in Haar@@ lem in 1905 .
the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Hospital , Munich @-@ Ost , is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 .
young people meet in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um on the premises of the former municipal institute .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
to the west lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , East residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural style reminiscent of the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ ian asylum , which had been destroyed during the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bombs broke many holes in the inner city in December 1944 .
a big one remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 , the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second railroad race track took place .
with the slide bar , the old Munich @-@ map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at Mari@@ enhof .
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ mers issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special care when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here , &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently passed law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to obtain discrimination complaints , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities that aim dispro@@ portion@@ ately against minorities , prompted the group to issue travel warnings , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist attacks against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline while travelling through the state and was arrested by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crime .
the Council also points to a recent report of the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i &apos;s Office of At@@ tor@@ ney General , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state will be hal@@ ted 75 percent more frequently than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and associates what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be prepared to bring in the deposit money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the crime @-@ crime report of the FBI , which classi@@ fy the state regarding the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws that commit local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further road pro@@ visioning after AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s view .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fence project is elementary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Wei@@ de@@ jo@@ n project is a success project and will continue next year .
members of the CD@@ U , Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac , have created a picture on site .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties at the Land@@ gra@@ ben@@ hof of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk cows and also many young animals and is home to five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing way for him for the milk of his cows , according to Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este is exclusively Regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also chairman of B@@ L@@ H@@ V , he described the fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot generate profit on such steep faces .
the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , many have to be worked on with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if it does not lead to bio@@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the significance of the fence project and is glad of the leader support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are the farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to carry on their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the promotion the farmers often stand in the cri@@ tique
over the course of 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced .
the open up area is 40 hectares , which must not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of € 71 500 , half was supported by leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km pasture fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a good job , without farmers and women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Care Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art production of pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
moreover , the area to be enclosed may not be smu@@ g@@ gling ( inclin@@ ation over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the 2018 Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s tro@@ mb@@ one project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently under construction .
the total open area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans estimate them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ters would have caught him if he had done it .
but he touched their importance , and in particular the meaning attributed to it , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem which you refer to that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is per@@ tin@@ ent , but as he formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus &apos;s vibr@@ ating words , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your troubled masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , the miserable waste of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better to see on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in the s@@ ling@@ s of the United States .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the ties between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic illustration .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ antes .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the Com@@ ing of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atism , bringing the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty moves forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch will not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is rather unusual here on something .
the significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
Laz@@ arus &apos;s great fan@@ ciful act consisted in seeing her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terri@@ fying journeys on the decks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear .
and this of course is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wish to acknowledge .
their torch is not to enligh@@ ten the way , but to ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team .
the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special has developed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics have to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we are trying to understand it and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ovo - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected Team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver med@@ alists , competing at their fifth world championships in the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the runner @-@ up runner Mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year he set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch for a great season that included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says that she is &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team but in some cases also join med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; being special about the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what is my speech as captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heat up of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the papers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he har@@ med in criticism , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and that &apos;s why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his elec@@ tors and play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
hence the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , which is called officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who swing online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not water @-@ filled , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news release &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t like this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same topic , they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the staff of the governor called as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical body items or to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but this is exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also visited AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this shouldn &apos;t be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter @-@ recor@@ ders put on his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the UK , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who in the past year led to Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the Club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really feels like this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the promotion on his home floor .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad about how it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up a study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time there were about 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says the manager of the farm Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
the traffic , which hin@@ ders construction work again and again , is a big problem for the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and shut @-@ off filters is huge , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the regular buses are allowed to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite ti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the ind@@ ones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour , the sal@@ ted tu@@ ber is taken out with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a roof@@ ed room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course it can be late to work dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many are drinking hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote against the occupation forces .
an existing movement , stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part Papua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desolate . the journey includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ il and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transportation .
the city with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bamboo c@@ ences , and made of corrugated iron roofs , which were converted into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass Hill , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars , Papua related resources has been estimated .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for Papua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly $ 20 million local military and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150@@ ,000 in a single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ ian demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as have been genocide in the 1970 &quot; s according to the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; is said in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on the atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric attacks are especially popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a stream of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung ch@@ urch@@ ins sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who went to work in the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tasted the native Papua - the M@@ om &#91; the women &#93; from Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian president , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his campaign in 2014 to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on his way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken , because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that it will fill our hopes that justice will be restored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indones@@ ian soldiers erup@@ ted on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they were supposed to switch off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers fired on their sound and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , ch@@ ased and struck the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ chers , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua , women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command@@ o centre to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - running in a circle and im@@ itating a bird song - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstr@@ ators started to cast stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was listening to the atmosphere .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his multic@@ ol@@ ored painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the actor of the Papua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ ei@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to tackle the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , Minister of Security , said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to with@@ drew when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the United Nations for crimes against humanity , demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met such claims with a fi@@ ery un@@ beli@@ ever .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that the people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Indones@@ ian police shot on villa@@ gers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , &quot; said the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers to hold accoun@@ table and withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a resting place for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ land of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by catching spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people of Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty allevi@@ ates dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can work on four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ires airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
they rarely have capital or necessary skills to compete with their own businesses .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ der and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report about the most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Pap@@ ism : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government largely remains confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia has yet another presidential election , but the Papua people say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sh@@ uts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ ai knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai fire victims had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never give them justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget the perpetr@@ ators of their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire occurred on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in only two years , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) by accident .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , violations were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the shou@@ ting of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled the building .
the government said she was working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can rev@@ ital@@ ise questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rises all over the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has passed through his large Davis Cup @-@ Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City the revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single on this sport was not supported by two @-@ thirds majority by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
these are often very long , but also very much cher@@ ished five @-@ set classics remain the traditional value .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore barely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal had already come to fill the finale at a neutral location .
new from 2018 is only comparatively minor details : in the future , the fin@@ alists will have the right to host the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the following year in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to pass less official media appointments ahead of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring forbidden items to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey among air passengers shows that more than 20 percent of un@@ intentionally prohibited items are smu@@ g@@ gled past the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent who entered the aircraft as they inad@@ vert@@ ently bore prohibited knives or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had mistakenly travelled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey conducted by more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common objects that were deliberately caused by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent reported to know@@ ingly carry items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many inad@@ vert@@ ently brought smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many had intentionally done it .
it is no surprise that people who know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly carry on smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - were those who most often fly .
the company however points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which fluids they may take with you or how much of them .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while , people thought T@@ SA could see books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give up with the huge number of orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has so far under@@ scored that a part of the customers has already re@@ trac@@ ted their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever triumph@@ ant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed a different , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure for the first time in the publication of the latest quarterly report : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
during the past few months , Mus@@ k often had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .
now Mus@@ k has been dre@@ aming : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics repeatedly pointed out that this is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely .
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations have been made , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss doesn &apos;t believe that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models should be taken together - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 a million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1,@@ 800 reservations are currently available per day .
if you order a Model 3 today , you must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand new production lines tested in practice without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are major delays , then the non @-@ binding of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ jects emissions from Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s rules on reducing emissions &quot; &quot; &quot;
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period running on October 1st for states to meet the standards of 2015 for floor @-@ to @-@ earth o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt declared in June that he would delay compliance with one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing in local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts Reg@@ ular roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement released on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ff suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the prepar@@ edness of the EPA to co @-@ operate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for carrying out and then wait to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial procedures , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives it to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the EPA opinion stated that P@@ ru@@ ff will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available full powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the O@@ zone Rules .
a bill approved in the last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure has not yet been voted in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who accused the EPA during this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schnei@@ der@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , O@@ reg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year .
public health officials and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ itts &apos;s unexpected change of course .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to tackle environmental pollution and its special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche , a Ser@@ en@@ ade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tum@@ bl@@ ings to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot;
in the year 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in the Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg document of origin : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tum@@ lingen including the &quot; Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wor@@ ding of the certificate , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard , to which the church or pat@@ ron@@ ate law belonged , and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as described in the description of the Ober@@ dorf Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , beside the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still to be seen in the village of Tum@@ lingen today , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the dominant sett@@ ler @-@ centre of the village .
old maps dating from the period around the year 1600 are supporting these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from Early Middle Ages .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this church .
connected with this was the right to appoint a parish priest or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two were broken at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell sets were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were stock@@ pil@@ ing near the church .
they broke out pul@@ pit and church seats and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from radio schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ arion church was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year 18@@ 34 a storm broke the church tower and half fell .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower @-@ tower existing today remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are the successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
the organizers invite friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ eage on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local ruler , speaks the final word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3 : 30 pm .
at the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers take out the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of great significance for Tum@@ lingen and listeners .
the friends and pat@@ rons of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the Council of Agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 , because at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind power concentration zone existed in Vier@@ sen at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city Vier@@ sen had a second wind @-@ force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette only a few days earlier , but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve , because of a lack of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning permission , the approved allowance is still un@@ lawful and therefore also declined , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : before the summer break the City Council again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; the district government &apos;s approval is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been received by the Vier@@ sen circle since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle makes it a matter of re@@ viewing the matter again .
however , they are not likely to cause the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the reasoning of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a new subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette the construction of four 200 meters high wind turbines .
already last year , the company , in which the city Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had le@@ ased lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are property .
with the establishment of four wind turbines , the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is expected to be covered - this is equivalent to about a fifth of the electricity needs of all Vier@@ sen@@ er households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in the process .
two more people were injured .
the state road was closed for hours .
according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the business association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to enti@@ ce residents to shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the Trade Union , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own city is in store away from the usual supermarket product .
accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies are expected to present their training positions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign aims not only for the inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags indicating the action weekend , Christian König .
city administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the commercial club and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well with sold Sunday , talks with all trades and hosts to make them active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the inner city while shopping .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was time to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly wi@@ dened , the king had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the nationwide third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time , will take part in five Thurin@@ gian cities .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote appreciation of local trade and highlight its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

Tr@@ ump sat under pressure after scre@@ ened tran@@ scripts from phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the bor@@ der@@ line
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump called on a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop telling publicly that he would not pay for a planned border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president beg@@ ged him because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA and s@@ ware to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees that emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was given by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Tr@@ ump finished the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists lead a rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ spe@@ ar Mer@@ cury went through a group of spectators in Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle ho@@ ist suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar and scrut@@ in@@ ised the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors , the in@@ mates were in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ am tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged down from the passenger seat .
fortunately this terrible scene , played on July 22nd , is just a reproduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; nearly all of them hit very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 citizens have been coming back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were syn@@ ched by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of mur@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years , no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the Georgia state and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him , the exhibition serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive righteousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays a sheet of cloth on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the loose for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black people to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer election campaign .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI the black farmers Roger Mal@@ com struck a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or was in the city that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land owner , paid 600 dollars to release Mal@@ com from prison , thus the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
but when they came from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b crashed into the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local law enforcement , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks makes it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and when you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual delivery of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , of which many believe that he does not exist in America any more .
it is difficult to watch , and yet more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ching , because we will be confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - came to a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
calf Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has played the role of the boss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boss &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for years , but he said the role will never be simpler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actor Dar@@ ingham Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and presses him , fur@@ i@@ ously , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a rep@@ lies the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs most lou@@ dly .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors sweat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship sub@@ stitutes the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman wearing a mour@@ ning dress stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays gri@@ eving praise of &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced heavy humidity for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ ze@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song end , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body &apos;s name .
children sit on their heads , record the fake blood and the silent ones and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy m@@ um@@ bles as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional load of the performance eventually breaks through him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know it &apos;s not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did this for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins together with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta is chat@@ ting about the pos@@ ing with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that felt the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds court at his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the reflection is inspiring in a certain way , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who doesn &apos;t study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the Wagner revolution@@ ises in Bay@@ reuth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf creates a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic six @-@ story setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner including the Mauer@@ park and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ d &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhine fat@@ alists pos@@ ing as rock ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; staging .
the three Rhein@@ thal daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderfully .

Stephen M@@ illing sings the deli@@ ght@@ fully fi@@ ery Ha@@ gen , which surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight boxing .
brut@@ ally the scene , when Siegfried da@@ w@@ ned .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) has to believe it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly hum@@ bly bow to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated stor@@ my .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in the face of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance was expected with excitement by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , he had to undergo a g@@ alling pipe concert in 2013 . five years later , there were great jubil@@ ations in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is excited about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive resume .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in a voluntary year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
crowd : usually in a St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture market , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked in the open all day at the school .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
quantity : I have taken Ab@@ itur .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I realized for myself that it &apos;s the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself , what do you do .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , at the focal point maybe , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study dual , probably doing a social worker training at the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably depends on where you are doing your FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
in other words , than in civil engineering ?
crowd : well , it &apos;s not a matter of calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
there are always other people who have a different story behind each other .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go individually to it .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is so .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job cuts , which the General Manager John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , is in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 points have already been lost .
in May , in a third cost @-@ cutting program , Pear@@ son announced a cost reduction plan by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ b@@ ings
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul &apos;s Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier , and wounded several others , say civil servants .
five soldiers and one interpreter have been injured , giving Nato an explanation .
according to local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h district .
bombing is the last violence Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive bomb . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at the B@@ agra@@ m airport in the US military hospital .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ ar@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby district of B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of it in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban claimed that they had carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most le@@ thal milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US forces pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ isions for Del@@ a@@ ying Smo@@ g Ru@@ le to C@@ lay
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , according to which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Rules 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that it is showing the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA Head Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in some of the country to determine where inc@@ isions have to be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Columbia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that according to Tr@@ ump is intended to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EPA Website says that inhal@@ ing air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma .
the common room wants to be a common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ corn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
while this is still going to take place until now the church community has been part of the community , there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with a total area of 70 square metres for a special price .
the administration and majority of the municipal council prefers to look forward to such a common room as a meeting point only for the residents of the fair living , but openly to the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet@@ ened will be the decision which has already been decided by providing funds for the current budget already last autumn , by means of funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal envis@@ ages in order to signal the investor that in this respect one does not want to t@@ oss sticks between the legs , stating that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding building - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , is unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it helps : unanim@@ ously he will pass the board .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call points to the many very own buildings with which one does not move so much , therefore they lean now in the common room out of the window , they say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m doing very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger really speaks for the common room - but absolutely against communal involvement .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy to any wealthy or even foreign investor .
this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter value , which is market@@ able in doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s request for the resolution to be consul@@ ted in accordance with the resolution , finds three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we summari@@ ze the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured in Gar@@ ath by a car on Wednesday and severely injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way from the Schwar@@ zer Weg in the direction of Hil@@ den on the bicycle path of the Schwar@@ zer Weg .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the hed@@ geho@@ g entered the street , he obviously didn &apos;t care about the on@@ coming traffic .
he met with a car steering a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital by a sa@@ vi@@ or .
FC Bayern Munich has to give up on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must leave the match against Dortmund .
FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund with personnel care for the first mandatory play of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
human resources at German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to disp@@ ense with the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats over the past six months , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know we &apos;re not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory play of the season .
&quot; football is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin the nationwide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommo@@ dates the need for information of many har@@ lot visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he unites nature , science , movement and sporting performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 the association will plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the site .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the train will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star trail , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is far more distant .
it is also possible to medi@@ tate in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been running the highest situated observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the site in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ wer@@ age in the university city since 2003 on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet way leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( Community of Equ@@ ations ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to at the end point , degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact 75 meter distance of the sun measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is a good four kilometres .
while the light is needed from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
therefore , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star would last for half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko will meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion who went down@@ stairs to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super suspension weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ di@@ visi@@ oned world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How are you , champion ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko defended his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7@@ pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Cli@@ ma noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia reminded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to run down to lightweight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he has to move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans ask .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cli@@ ma asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on 23rd September .
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all the fans asked for him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he gu@@ essed Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he might participate in his Saturday fight .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko gave his generous praise to Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ battle champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks &quot; very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show punch strength then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the fight that must be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after pun@@ ches
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a began to lose control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market , shortly before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ came and then there remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , then traffic on the left lane could be led past the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener in Braunschweig for optim@@ ising the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , if not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these two ad@@ versaries were too much , and we have to watch out even better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain chain is to be further optimised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the For@@ tun@@ en doesn &apos;t want to catch a gate after a free push .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be that no one will stand up alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we are currently in the three @-@ chain at Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , but that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we can &apos;t afford so many mistakes in the setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could well be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand at four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season opening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judge the start of the season after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e only because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a thunder@@ storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit more fresh as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a rise in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 percent where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the guests from the Rhin@@ eland come as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away just because we have the right to get into the first six is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is absolutely positive with only one defeat against the eye out of nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said For@@ tun@@ as Chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results from Swedish asylum seekers evaluation published
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Auth@@ orities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine have started conducting the tests last year .
during the asylum process , they should take a closer look at age , after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , migration dec@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged 18 or over , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age .
in May the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 instances that suggest that the person under investigation is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det reviews the 5@@ 81 results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had frank@@ ly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work covers the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they used to go sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot safely say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is in@@ appropriate is small .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a concrete part of the concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction at the Department of Road Engineering and Transport in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ aul@@ ted concrete arch bridge , cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has meanwhile arrived in the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red sand@@ stone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach opened on Wednesday morning on the northern side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a border for@@ tification , which is also used as an operating path .
on Friday , a 2,@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
the special thing about this is that it deals with finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps .
the laying of cables through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires a special feeling of t@@ act .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , connected to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish first had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting pond in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road is fully blocked in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels &apos; Tann@@ enhof &apos; and &apos; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &apos; .
the cost of the three bridge costs amounts to 700 000 Euro .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
it &apos;s not so common for parties to pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under one hat .
the parties represented in the power of the volcano ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully this day , because the Af@@ D invites to the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle , R@@ ond@@ ell , according to the poster &quot; Great Elec@@ toral Campa@@ ign . &quot;
and familiar names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24th , and the deputy Federal President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site for hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but to demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic under the slogan &quot; All at one table &quot; was planned on the fountain field , but now takes place on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elles - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum Eine Welt and one of the leading organisers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ur@@ german &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence , especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes is reported by the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic sul@@ fur , he tried such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf lived in constant demand in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces available due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church .
so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the forec@@ our@@ t , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also happening : at about 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ men Uwe Boy .
in the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy Federal President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D @-@ event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move away - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a meeting with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ lach &apos;s Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; hits classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to transc@@ end the boundaries of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz guitarist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and the free play blend into a fascinating overall art work .
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially written for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ lach convent church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love roasted cheese and will eat it to the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately went out bitter .
despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin compar@@ es to the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously in love with every one I &apos;ve visited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten acknowledged that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or obstruc@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she especially suffered during the school time when she preferred to dress like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven the children told me that I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , sc@@ ared and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public does not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to communicate in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump had promised a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate .
according to For@@ bes , Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes finds that he has coal mines in five states , and his father inherited a coal business .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening gave a statement in which it said : &quot; the Party Exchange of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance , and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ uses for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the global head of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included again in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes who have won gold and silver med@@ als in competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ supported dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do all things to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia would accept the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the leader of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still active , he told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral p@@ act for soldiers in Mali
during a funeral service in the North Hessen Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers have thought about a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing about the still un@@ clari@@ fied cause of the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she described the two opposite pilots as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice carried out in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Northern H@@ esse came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the German army in the frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service took place in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
the Trau@@ mer@@ ä@@ ste settled down , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense by the Le@@ yen called the surrounding soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and dri@@ fted in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief captain took up the flight operation of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilot of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation was not able to turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubt on the UN Mission in Mali does not show Minister of the Le@@ yen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
when and where they are being buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ g@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , and said it further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , remains unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also took off the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
it is still unclear where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will finally be .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew off , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand with the Dan@@ es in his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and which in this country had the reputation of being the brand of social critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday the parliament &apos;s resolution was pronounced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
prior to that , the surprising exit of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties from their state parliament in Lower Saxony over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the country &apos;s election , the Red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its short one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ enth established her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record them .
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on January 14th next year .
Th@@ ü@@ k@@ ler said that the red @-@ green national government must now decide whether to rule in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves as soon as possible its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Land Constitution also envis@@ ages the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament withdraw@@ s trust and sel@@ ects a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be examined properly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will calm@@ ly discuss all your questions if they are legally audi@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ essa &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens asked the dissi@@ dent MPs to return their country mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that it will return its land mandate , which it has received over the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Gre@@ ens Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of El@@ ke T@@ enth to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal by the Lower Saxony MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the country day .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their past vanity and fru@@ stration expressed their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD secretary Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony takes on this dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ y and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U president , Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to take El@@ ke T@@ westen into CD@@ U .
the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the country &apos;s election in 2013 with personal care@@ gi@@ vers .
at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest party in the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one voice in the parliament .
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany discusses poll@@ uted eggs .
how was the sc@@ andal possible ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) talks to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) and answers .
Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery @-@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the respective eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if we know what we are currently aware of , health hazards are practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis response - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has turned up immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the emergence of Germany &apos;s const@@ ern@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade has as much concern as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual value of eggs is exceeded by 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the companies are not to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , production companies do not have an immediate fault .
instead , they must expect economic damage due to presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there is too little check@@ ers in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is it missing only in the staff or at the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
precisely because of this , a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences are available are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm system really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and transpor@@ table foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly treated .
the fake means are manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ producing animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be solved quickly and comprehen@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A because the manag@@ erial organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules that have been launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G must eventually prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without large losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G certainly can make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and will bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the funding of the team through the energy rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must counter@@ act legitimate income sources which allow them the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A pres@@ idents in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations , who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked trying to ruin when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses amoun@@ ting to EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in favour of the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenue streams for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros can be reported in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of US sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the har@@ dest sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( back then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs who could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ing was to exceed the standard market sets , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of the P@@ SA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the World Cup 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup will be ambass@@ adors and could easily find out such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to every attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
accounts for the last fiscal year need to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and it tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s latter ownership of PS@@ G .
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by a society .
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financi@@ elle fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss .
now the close cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order .
Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white chocolate boxes wrapped up to 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; North @-@ West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but what is more important is the advertising effect : for a sho@@ emaker , it is a prestigious order .
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants are in the new ten@@ dering process .
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to rev@@ ise the treaty over the spring of 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
chocolate bars distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablet in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo brought Swiss a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works together with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of First Class with treats from the Spr@@ ün@@ gli Con@@ fis@@ erie are spoiled , in the Business Class nasty passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y distri@@ butes both in business and economy class on the short circuit .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is nostal@@ gic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter turned the Sk@@ etch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd came to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our fac@@ ebook @-@ capable era . permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels as if time was short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising jar of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who are grown up - yet they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults now playing adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting recognition principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand That sha@@ kes the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character is rum@@ ored by an Apple Power@@ book , some Inline Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy vi@@ cious plot involving Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ done impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ings of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; his former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental del@@ usion that this fran@@ chise might heat up like a repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until it reaches that which I consider as its logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band how to attend the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is now reminded of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East versus West E@@ Q@@ C icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ef@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980 &apos;s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic idi@@ ot - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
with six long episodes , the comedy is gone , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was edited on a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police is a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 and had already issued warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials employed large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
two persons were arrested at the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are presumably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian inspec@@ tors were involved in the campaign .
over 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany since summer 2016 .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there existed a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
that is why the large @-@ scale deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo .
the investigations carried out mainly Italian citizens with narrow reference to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the account of the gang .
Weise dec@@ lo@@ dges large gaps in the for@@ eigner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has re@@ port@@ edly brought attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s Central Register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may result in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partially serious wrong decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned in an analysis published by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to information , the Register records 10 million people with foreign nationality , including about 5.@@ 7 million people from non @-@ EU countries .
data is therefore administered by some 600 ali@@ ens in Germany .
because the data was not maintained sufficiently , the quality of data in parts has not been good so far .
in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; of people who have long ceased to be alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; er@@ ron@@ eous data inputs can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics of a sufficient number of people , EU citizens were also included , who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such mis@@ concep@@ tions led to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distorted debate on dealing with foreigners &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; therefore it is said in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , if they have arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper , it says that the BA@@ MF introduces such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees arriving at first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant enters another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the grounds , the ministry is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy handed over guarantees to the reception and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back in the framework of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Yel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening for the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ ri@@ chen@@ bach provided blood donation to other people .
at least among the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , meanwhile , has donated 50 litres of blood to his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the council , the congregation is hon@@ oring multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our bodies are designed for this and we pay respect for the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , not sel@@ fl@@ ess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood don@@ or helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the district preparation director of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three persons could already benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mais@@ enb@@ acher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported on the actions carried out in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district preparation manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house had led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ schau were among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations each .
half as many are managing Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ an@@ ie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave every 500 milli@@ liter of their juice .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation on an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensified pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates down to 0.@@ 25 % , whereas in this month fewer members asp@@ ire to increase because the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alized that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to cur@@ b the inflation which was initiated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that the bor@@ rowing costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut economic stimulus package issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ mentally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the downward @-@ corrected growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell on these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for interest rates and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for budgets that are affected by rising inflation and minor wage increases , since tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it will improve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy will not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the loss of income in the coming years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she added that wages will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote caused by the decline in the findings .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
prior to the Bank &apos;s last judgment on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will be attracting them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage bro@@ kers said : &quot; given the recent decline in swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those who run the existing De@@ als and take out the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
patients will have access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) which had been taken prior to sexual intercourse ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ch@@ ess@@ ation announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to enable the application of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV medicine taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection @-@ prone areas .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
appropriate participants are identified in clinics including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and are registered with a family physician can also sign up for a possible participation at their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS UK signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in cop@@ ing with one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when it focuses on people in need and vulnerable , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ancy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that it will contribute to the eradic@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living a great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , reduced himself from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with it and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 @-@ feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but placing the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille Lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to let it work longer .
in the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforcement , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ productive , so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform itself by a good design and an increased square metre number of something standard in something completely amazing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation over one of Vict@@ ori@@ as &apos;s biggest real estate empire worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a store at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and the De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in @-@ Paul is described as the &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul roughly one @-@ third .
a court case states that this means that Col@@ in property has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the app@@ rais@@ als proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations .
the brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost increases , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first den@@ im of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West co there when he was &quot; in my last years of the High School when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S Group , claiming that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
both Luke and Mark are , so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in was very restra@@ ined , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and following a biography from Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire in 2015 , the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new chief of staff plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met at his first working day with senior employees , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump in White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the President .
Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed for unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former election campaig@@ ner Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February about Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping track of Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant lob@@ b@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump Break@@ s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know others - that tr@@ umps with@@ twe@@ ets without their intervention would have contained even more fuel .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump didn &apos;t send .
if his staff managed to keep him away from him a few times , then their efforts paid off .
but nobody has consistently prevented it from calling out Tr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors to give the president doub@@ t@@ ful information for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former plat@@ former officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with embarrass@@ ed le@@ aks , and that he stiff@@ ens out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ tar@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to ch@@ ic@@ ans or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; jump read the article and started questioning employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , which receives the pump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the population will pray and hope to help the population .
the police all over Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals during this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are not known in nature , references from the population will be hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action following the winter of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fle@@ d@@ dings were hiding at tourist destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 postcards for the requested criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ able , more than 2.5 million times this website has been viewed .
36 of the online votes have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to notices after the publication on the website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s row &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands once again stand with some determined travellers on a war base , who have negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the church to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought back horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans , after they were ki@@ cked out only in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defence assets and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent further by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council has to be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , moved on and are back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long sub@@ missions to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ab@@ orig@@ ine who did not want to be called said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible notify an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will find Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise from Bir@@ k@@ enhof
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re @-@ opened on March 1 next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenues from the tourist tax were also lost .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county , the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective shelter , which caused controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not un@@ disputed in the municipal council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested people at the time .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been in front of the entrance since a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is to be done .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings are partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be done in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a gem out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but even at a higher centre level , Sch@@ erer says .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its 60 rooms , wants to set up broad@@ ly , explains Sch@@ erer further .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he had already had conversations with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
looking at the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to define himself exactly .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the outside facilities are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace is created , which will be open to the public by the restaurant .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Issu@@ er sets Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special Agent Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury upon a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the panel accepted the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had extended and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reports that there are already first invitations from the committee in connection with a meeting between the el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time being specifically involved in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ul@@ s campaign team and Moscow .
the investig@@ ators focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also scrut@@ ini@@ zed more and more private and business connections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump had personally moved to the centre and alle@@ ge the accus@@ ation whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Jury is to check present evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether the prosecution is to be charged .
Grand Jury is therefore also called &apos; bun@@ t@@ ings &apos; .
they are usually switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor in order to invite individuals to take part under oath . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the CN@@ N station , invitations were issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , it was said in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump counsel@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former chief commander Paul Man@@ a@@ fort joined the discussion .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the sub@@ stitution show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he would act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
however , the integration of the body at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for president Tr@@ ump is concerned .
in the midst of the new revelations , the president on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b said in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but this usually works in secret , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey told three times that he won &apos;t be established against the president .
I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the declaration .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this r@@ ump , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become loud , he wanted to obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary .
Com@@ ey announced in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the then National Security Ad@@ visor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Agent and its employees .
this triggered speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to be released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air around the later res@@ ig@@ ned President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on ur@@ ging the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft bill on Thursday , after which the special agent could not be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ eber@@ gs floating in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the Antar@@ c@@ tica a gigantic Eis@@ berg has detached from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Shel@@ f .
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , weighing over one tri@@ l@@ lion tons , now drives north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the last three decades .
there is no danger to humans .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the departure of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
in total , however , for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it is growing more and more into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ra is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this cow@@ ard , the balance of wa@@ xes and abor@@ tions was disturbed some years ago .
A@@ WI research scientist , Daniela Jan@@ sen , writes a complete Shel@@ f .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is in danger as the front edge has never gone as far back as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point .
the melting of the ice shelf and the ic@@ e@@ berg does not hei@@ gh@@ ten the sea level because they float on the water and ice so much water as it does after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow faster than before .
this could increase the sea level , however , only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it falls regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most gra@@ ceful retreat ever since the records began , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists it is disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven will grow back or fall back in the long run and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said , &quot; Our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
although these researchers do not trace the departure of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , however , many king@@ f@@ unders of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long tip of the Antar@@ c@@ tica stretches towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the Antar@@ ctic ice surface has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .
over the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature is the quick@@ est .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the personnel
because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to come out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs were built in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials are working for the Kreis@@ zeitung in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have completed their first working day .
the apprenti@@ ces in the circle are obviously very much sought @-@ after .
there were around 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the M@@ ett@@ mann circuit .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and to counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the desire of the parties , the administration shall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to not only cover short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the candidate shortage in a future @-@ oriented manner , that is to say .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate internally and extern@@ ally , demonstrate concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contest of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees who are able to leave the service due to illness or age @-@ related reasons .
so high time for action so that not even more places will remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint proposal with his party .
he had long for a big surprise in the circle @-@ day when he publicly challenged the personnel costs cap and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
people want all the possibilities to be verified that allow an exit from the local employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the county government should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the revol@@ ving cities - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money exist only if one changes to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
last but not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers , Coun@@ cill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy har@@ dens the tone on NGO Mig@@ rants &quot; lif@@ es
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned of NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs no longer sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came one day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team effectively collabor@@ ated with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express itself in extensive alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the rescue of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess all accus@@ ations that are currently collected after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had monitored the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that its crew will take din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are supplied directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose contents were published by Italian media .
the crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard who over@@ sees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ entr@@ a must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue missions have agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates Organisation is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ ner Bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berliner Ou@@ pole &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North pf@@ alz region to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pal@@ at@@ inate woods and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once again , the viewpoint at the viewpoint , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flew &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .

in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .

console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for e @-@ sports
will the sport stars be sitting in front of computer consoles in the future , instead of struggling with wind and weather over stadium racing ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fork inclusive .
these have also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly engaged in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to attract new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Executive Board Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are still many clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where players from different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with celeb@@ r@@ ity E @-@ athletes under contract , it is possible to be more often present on these markets online than to send to Asia only once a year .
what is it all about ?
in e @-@ sport , computer games such as League of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or &quot; Football Simulation &quot; are fought at competition level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long established themselves , in which the pros play against each other .
and by 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ert has also been dealing with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ ing@@ ered player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ atics also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of the classical sport were missing .
in a positive way , the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
players are travelling internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
turnover rises to 130 million in three years .
against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; says Del@@ o@@ itte .
many countries are already on the international level .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where former basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are involved in the N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ sports bet@@ ting provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Europe , too , things are happening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ o .
in the Netherlands and France , the football first league organisations according to D@@ utt are meanwhile obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Board member R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to decay into nostal@@ gia and to clear the old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time in the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to the fact that only football remains the same as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy push@@ es for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sent@@ encing behind bars and five years were subjected to par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted of negligence in June of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter was standing there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down @-@ looking eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they fully regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day when I don &apos;t be@@ g the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I surround him with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity , for his sisters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ cked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to call another commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ter &apos;s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get up , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought through the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from any press in the event .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder on her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ en : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run during the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern looks after the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation doesn &apos;t hurt there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even though the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups no Philip Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made his rush to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the cont@@ ented cup winner after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the stand could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Neap@@ el .
but the sign of the coach could be interpreted by Kim@@ i too .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f , made up of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from the holiday , but he .
sugar is distributed to those who want to drink a lot , which you want to keep in a good mood .
those who have been chosen to take part in Lah@@ ti &apos;s heritage can only use a small extra motivation .
Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday 22 @-@ year @-@ old scored a Mini @-@ Lah@@ m over the field .
right rear , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age at the arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation as the one who can take the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions and tried to steer the un@@ en@@ acted trou@@ pe .
he had a look at the whole , while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal &apos;s lack of fitness to re@@ play ( barely folding ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus on the devil come out to the performances of the Asia journey ( worked only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thereby not neg@@ atively fall in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ tri@@ cot .
after all , it worked out quite well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ mir , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both acted compet@@ ently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ ver tried a few times in the game setup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mits that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bayern @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ts , one saw in the connection to the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ mir retired after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard an interesting proposition from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller had registered on Twitter just before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bayern @-@ Legi@@ onna@@ ire is a club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ captains Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our ladies .

companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ atine Minister : economy pra@@ ises the pace of science
it was often unfor@@ giving , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green Party ) was the Minister of Economics of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies from the region speak on T V request from a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old Cab@@ inet .
Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; bis@@ sing addresses the needs of the economy which has all blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around is of course in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now up @-@ to @-@ date in the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 is to be entitled to construction law .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Bank of Trier , which is in urgent need of the federal transport plan .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , &quot; says the Ministry spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees it as a guide to support regional , but international competing companies .
as von Wis@@ sing , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( Chamber of Commerce of Trier ) stri@@ ves to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praised the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
fores@@ een is a premium of 1000 Euro for the master exam and 2500 Euros if graduates become independent within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work schedule for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts must be created quickly , and at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , &quot; says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
only 29 positions have been occupied by 56 new engineers who wish to employ Wis@@ sing in the state @-@ run mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more jobs to be allocated to external offices .
CD@@ U , vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , points to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also expects the country &apos;s concept to solve the shortage of skilled labour in the region .
sober@@ ing is the previous broadband expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with grade 3.3 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ating internet connections and out@@ breaks .
former Minister for Economic Affairs E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .
the Green faction left Lem@@ ke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she had already cleared the field for in@@ consisten@@ cies .
Audi aims to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a back@@ lash
one day before Audi &apos;s announcement BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than travel restrictions , &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install equipment for the neutr@@ alisation of exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of inc@@ iting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
companies are trying to avoid the short@@ com@@ ings of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but ride back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is contributing dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , there will be a raft around Munich on Saturday , which has a special message .
if you go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Construction Department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a big info @-@ saver .
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar should be sharpen@@ ed as a protected wild flow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft sailed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s nose @-@ n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on@@ ists , the no@@ stri@@ ls of his characters are his trademarks .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an still draws and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he suggested himself as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own figures , he still lives at the drawing table , works every day for almost ten hours .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll characters continue to find widespread use worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and TV series with his characters for six years .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any favorite animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ th @-@ foot@@ er as a counter @-@ player .
his figures speak for the first time in the 3D film , which is supposed to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he prefers to rely on the TV series , which , as his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and a lot more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts holi@@ day@@ makers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant o@@ hren with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either lacking or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary this year .

the murder of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings are sufficient .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of being on the salary list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the may@@ hem of Mexico dangerous .
there is no pause for violence , and as the bodies pile up throughout the country , more and more journalists are growing : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to joined forces in December 2012 .
among the latter is her editor and her inspiration for Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .
his absence is felt deep although his presence is everywhere - a big picture of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
in Fe@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are un@@ comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is still more tre@@ ach@@ erous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we all di@@ str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s capital .
he only managed to go a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve Flow . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or several people are shot on the street or that the grav@@ ey@@ ard is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ stor@@ eyed m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Fe@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the children , suspected aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to news@@ ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without b@@ ump@@ ing on the drug tox@@ in problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting resear@@ ches without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to live on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you will notice as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for routine his ruin ?
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret starting and landing ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
tru@@ sting his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing is happening with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Fe@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers , which the governor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it has been months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has written on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous boxing writer Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group resi@@ ding in one of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an &apos;s most expensive restaurants , a block from the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the entire century .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few months earlier , readers watched Val@@ dez &apos;s column as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we used to have known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slim body keyboard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office is dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers which protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected themselves : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the Office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
throughout the country , journalists have grown lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on foot@@ paths and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez acc@@ uses the authorities to spy on journalists and destroy them because they have said the truth .
she has since then asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an in@@ different society .
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a ceiling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the past year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because you want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border @-@ state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border @-@ state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their own countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking frigh@@ tens him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Fe@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when suddenly all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to h@@ um .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ alling ri@@ vals and security forces near Maz@@ at@@ lan &apos;s seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the ker@@ b edge you have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .

si@@ ren he@@ ul@@ ten close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the polic@@ emen who stopped guard to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Fe@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If the same day , Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid their enemies
at first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker have been preserved so well that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so well received that they could even find that his fla@@ ky skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the besieg@@ ed ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived between 110 million and 112 million years in the middle of the chal@@ k period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his amaz@@ ingly well @-@ preserved condition has start@@ led scientists who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
he met something that seemed out of place by the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy earth cl@@ ump@@ ing .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have discovered that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used an shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ balancing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to better mix in his surroundings and ev@@ ade his enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ sm@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals .
it points out that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by the din@@ osau@@ rs by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this no@@ dose @-@ carrier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the Dinosau@@ rs predat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Time must have been , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was red @-@ brown .
scientists continue to explore the animal on clu@@ es about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal wall to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , came into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea floor .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ served sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early part of the cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is asleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the besieg@@ ed ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips ra@@ ging from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swept away by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r preserved his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the hau@@ sts are still covering b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is so &apos; rare as a profit in the lot@@ tery .
the more I get it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
c@@ logged remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates carrying the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales at his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ mo@@ cap on A@@ 8 : many injured
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : close to 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ mo@@ cap .
there are numerous wounded , kilometre @-@ long st@@ out and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured during a mass ar@@ mo@@ cap on Thursday afternoon .
according to the first data of the police , between the connecting points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , nearly 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , crashed into each other .
the exact number of publishers at first did not provide any information .
it is a matter of light to moderate injuries , a police spokes@@ man said .
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometre back @-@ back was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it was also on the counter @-@ track to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade took down the characteristics of the vehicle operators , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is happening in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ening in his work and has just a genius idea .
and then : buff@@ alo .
comes the conductor and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ ec@@ ured or pul@@ ls the passenger in the midst of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the complete map control .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus vali@@ date the ticket .
a test operation is currently running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many other routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the ticket de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the case for most passengers .
it also has to be bought via the train , the DB navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call your ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the test customers a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears .
the train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the reserved seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at room Y at the ticket inspection , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket .
so one can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel by our train atten@@ dant relaxed without ticket inspections , check out the DB navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Chief Marketing Officer of DB Fern@@ verkehr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest nu@@ is@@ ance .
because often one has , in any case , one of the fellow travellers not all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or ID card is missing or a document that you have to show .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s ticket and the conductor takes the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that just on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further gn@@ um@@ mers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken up to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her telephone .
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child and it &apos;s still lying on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ the@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rescu@@ ed on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , live on twe@@ ets .
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she left her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people who cried , and of a man claiming to be Brown &apos;s father , who had a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he rec@@ alled her testimony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we are used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 year old daughter out of her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l , with her daughter , wearing a flower @-@ dress and a matching crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had innum@@ erable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I have the chance to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad job to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a history that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that prof@@ ited from their pain and their ability to resist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death row in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other indigenous people followed the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team in the years following Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for I shall be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life , how she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media after the death of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identifies itself as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not by chance , although it was at the forefront , because in a life of these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman stands so much in the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
she still cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she walked into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone divi@@ des the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
there is hardly any cold on the subject .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some say to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole behold ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need a human &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while pro@@ pon@@ ents suggest that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , and the other businesses profit from it , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the beginning of construction work , it will conclude .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in addition to Bed@@ a Square with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping in the farmer &apos;s market almost every week for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s ei for us .
we would like to see that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall can settle in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are the shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find this superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are plenty of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is even more important that at least the market hall remains intact .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mainly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shop shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the rent there are often not acceptable for a retailer .
too bad , special transactions almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmer &apos;s market hall go down during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes up at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ o@@ sts bit gallery ever manage to sell all the stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it won &apos;t work .
and there is no need for a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - point@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces can be seen - white , black and brown ones , almost im@@ percep@@ tible , hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence after signing secret diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ union and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted for 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the law , computer fraud and theft .
the prison was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits visi@@ bly on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just returned from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look .
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ained m@@ use became un@@ equal bri@@ ms which changed several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future where President Chel@@ ating would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama actually only few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release would demand for seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump is conducting a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is provided with a heart ) at the end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousand @-@ fü@@ ß@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respects , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome will not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she comes up with an acqu@@ itt@@ al phone in his hand from the discipline barracks of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they put your words in the cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ ose b@@ umps when talking about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of space by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations expressing themselves like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also target @-@ oriented , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past , I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg by the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University sought for murder
a country @-@ wide human @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several en@@ grav@@ ings .
a common warning system , published by the Chicago Police Department , states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ectives are investigating the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ itar@@ ist , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them should now be praised and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case that is examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates in this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ itar@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are prepared to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in every possible way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly appe@@ aled to the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities will help find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , which had just received a mysterious tip stating that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and investig@@ ates a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA &apos;s timetable for compliance with the code that describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list stipul@@ ates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we won &apos;t admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the words unanim@@ ously agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody wants to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the Dop@@ ing sc@@ andal by the WA@@ DA from conducting dop@@ ing checks in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA &quot; moves in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore
the divisions shared this with each other .
it was a purely precau@@ tionary measure , it could not be assumed from any health impairment , it was said in the announcement .
from now on only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative for fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lung mut@@ ation .
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency in his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the poll@@ s did not work .
responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of human resource start @-@ ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide staff anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow managers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel with G@@ LIN@@ T in the three years .
in addition to snap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so you can drill down why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance business could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ ick , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
you have recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ ick enables companies to send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulses &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line where employees can report bad behavior .
and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has deployed for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now , as the company sets up Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously covered by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair internship - can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take care of ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ verti@@ ces offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that supports venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Con@@ verti@@ ble received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter@@ ing secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than previously .
high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only used in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you can give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that has heard their voices and that the work they do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ verti@@ ble and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if third @-@ party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement following the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks staff for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough or not at all , this can lead to dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ cul@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4.000 feedback , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so ret@@ t .
and after receiving feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run it leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; Vit@@ rano said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose any company .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA players chat on one side of the team &apos;s new practice areas on campus .
some have pulled off their jer@@ sey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these un@@ working minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final ex@@ ams after the three hour practice before returning to the Wasser@@ mann Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday for Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 a.m. in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins shifted the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he supported the rules change of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they continue to plac@@ ate themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice once the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been ki@@ cked off with foot@@ balls , which is a protective network behind a door@@ post , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then sett@@ ling there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on car park 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles to third party fak@@ ers and then show their results below the original fee , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it &apos;s one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible mis@@ understand@@ ings and to send them to fact inspec@@ tors that may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan for social media networks to be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review was started in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out which stories are cont@@ ested by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its feature for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ 1980 and 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opolitan Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ dile@@ ction for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Rout@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des that is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found un@@ expectedly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; ) all seems too good to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted cup@@ ids on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape care , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps depicting what possessed : &quot; you might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it artist who hid the family Dar@@ rel@@ l for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century depicted his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite Ga@@ un@@ er , making money and spending money for things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men rede@@ emed their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ lords . &quot;
after the end of his mission in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he has spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready again with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf veiled
with the conce@@ al@@ ment of the 301 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August , it should be the highlight of the campaign to give a feast on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cre@@ ators of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website which was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we as a bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizen are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , it is in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost a mid @-@ figure figure for its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) consul@@ ts about retirement and promotions in officers &quot; cor@@ ps .
this is also this week .
at first glance , a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the presi@@ dency of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the He@@ ads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the consultations .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number .
the government is attracting the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , the air forces and the na@@ vy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wire pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had designated the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discomfort in the military headquarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are concerns in the General Staff for an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ sc@@ arf ban for soldiers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , large @-@ scale fishing in the army and security forces continue .
in mid @-@ July , by decree , Erdo@@ gan was firing another 73@@ 95 officer , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the masters of the country earlier .
three times they stro@@ ve upon their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan had taken the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform directives of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is driving forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a non @-@ named officer , who sought asylum after the attempted coup against persecution in foreign countries , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the alliance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it envis@@ ages reducing the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , more stringent regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise sal@@ aries and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way the US will issue Green Cards from other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent chain migration and replace the present system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to refurb@@ ish circuit for road traffic shuttle
over the past few months over the future of the race ticket has been fought over and over again .
even before the end of the year , at the ailing circuit on which the tourist train drives , is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work on the track will begin this year according to the Ministry of Transport .
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; declared Deputy Secretary of State Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the costs for the repair of the track were reduced to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country assumes 75 per cent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future by the country , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia Rail@@ ways as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards were negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
the race stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will thus be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is an especially popular railway link between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is used by a large number of people in order to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also strongly bul@@ ky in parts .
the ascen@@ sion of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t become even more cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming .
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; customize &quot; his robot according to his beliefs , and select everything from the robot eye color over the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it will be more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ end@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , featuring pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this ascen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , distur@@ bs one of the most .
on his website was compatible True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different sex toy .
their emergence and their increasing refin@@ ement point to something Dun@@ kl@@ ess and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R is notic@@ ing their rising popularity , they remain tent@@ atively on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the peripheral zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots are appearing in a time in which the rights of women are globally threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the swal@@ lowed body and the ext@@ inct eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump era that political spl@@ its that pol@@ arized U.S. elec@@ torate have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump selecting relatives .
we all re@@ strain all of us to burst our filter bags .
less noted is the power of m@@ umps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist den@@ ser , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the repub@@ li@@ can relationship , with whom she fought for decades for politics , suddenly and very odd on the same side .
this certainly is a good thing for the dining table , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that one day his bi@@ bs will no longer be thrown away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Right W@@ ing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness compared to its standards .
I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in town , we brought our kids to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of New York &apos;s car@@ ou@@ sels , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the kli@@ m@@ bling music im@@ parts this in a strange way .
as many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Them@@ e Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage does not count - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , since two @-@ year @-@ olds , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have assessed the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked for it .
on the other hand , during this week , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store ap@@ ologi@@ zed gri@@ ev@@ ingly , while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us mis@@ placed with chest pain from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his w@@ ri@@ sts , which he re@@ port@@ edly suffered from the prison authorities in his cell .
because of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der who hid herself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National prosec@@ uting authority said that she will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no capital punishment in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the fourth @-@ grade women from F@@ ern and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen have been dischar@@ ged into the school holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the class@@ mates will go to college in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 students of the four classes chose Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , a young eagle , who grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a chicken , a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of it was broken , and the eagle stretched out its wings on a high mountain .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken tail .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les carrying the cylinders to the bet .
the Adler stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young @-@ animal is indeed different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belonged to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every quarter of the neighborhood that he felt accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a letter of gratitude to the colleagues , former school director Michael Müller , who always jump@@ ed up at teaching pas@@ sports and the par@@ ental representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber time is now over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said .
after two years of teaching , she did not leave her students very reluct@@ antly , because it was a really great time .
in the end , they have been able to rely on the fourth @-@ grade wat@@ chers .
at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
there was great joy in the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced , quoted by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
they were released the same day as an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place every one that is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , fin@@ es considerable fin@@ es .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel peak , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission behaviour of cars of the emission class Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europa offers assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has been ordered by the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a quick implementation in the coming months , but not yet known an exact date .
Daimler has reported to each person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions be postpon@@ ed altogether ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
the depen@@ dency of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have seen that the car manufacturers act voluntarily on the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do that do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive price @-@ loss of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threaten ?
the ACE does not fear this .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas there has so far been no loss of value for older diesel engines .
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - in protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the prestigious awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) were among the honored .
the awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the prize @-@ winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series therefore already announced to refrain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to ignore the arts and human rights completely - to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burden me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tr@@ ump to make her point of view clear .
the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest sacred place in the US capital .
former lau@@ re@@ ates include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been working for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he teaches in the press conference .
he reports about varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his followers .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this should be enough time for a famili@@ ar@@ isation , taking into account the regular periods of notice .
as Has@@ lach works for the administration community as a sub@@ contracting authority , the applicant has to present corresponding conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they cannot fill them out , then the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but clos@@ eness to the citizens is important to the city and to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , who reports about a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building office and its staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking area are about to be found .
the zig@@ z@@ ags between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach are renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will handle some 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is great le@@ e@@ way for a city @-@ builder .
Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener can react very flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what is right &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city master builder points out .
in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is responsible for a high degree of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs through my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination , he can count on many years of collabor@@ ator : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been on board for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city .
according to information from the town of Has@@ lach , who would like to be heir to Roland W@@ acker , he should be able to instruc@@ t his studies as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor with a subject area of architecture and have good expertise in the areas of civil engineering and building planning law .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ( Stadt@@ bau@@ amt ) supports construction and civil engineering , construction planning , renovation projects , administration of urban property , urban farm yard with building yard and municipal gardening business , as well as under construction law and monument protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : southern run@@ way locked
according to the police , the unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad track over the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were badly damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night .
near the crime scene a pink sco@@ oter and a bike driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ sting area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch about the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators would have put themselves in danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the cost of rail freight traffic , even sponsors of the railway customers could come to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum could be assumed , the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern track could be guided without disabilities .
just under ten passenger trains were dropped on Friday afternoon , two of them entered the long distance .
freight trains did not fall out , but they had delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims precisely the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ urable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while the suffer@@ ers are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant col@@ on .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the intest@@ ines are pat@@ rolling to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not inv@@ ade the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium tends too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice is found that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han increases toler@@ able , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also assists people .
the post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan searched for a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe but had not had this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with immune cells , but were lacking in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created by L. Cru@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria acted on the immune system , the researchers L. Cru@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s feed , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same toler@@ anc@@ erous cells as mice , and that most of us L. Cru@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. Cru@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potential high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can potentially lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid started on Tuesday , and impressed in the keeper role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory tour Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which gave M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wished three other new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; getting three out of four , I thank the club for that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and with@@ drew in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turned out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , the Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers were always looking for Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only a fire of stor@@ my from the party headquarters , merely no counter @-@ wind from the Con@@ federation - was the most important wish of the election fighters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz heads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the staff from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have observed the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were deep failures .
one after the other .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising S &amp; D Group president Stephen Wei@@ l ( SPD ) over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party spokes@@ man Michael Kell@@ ner called on the angry low @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transfer to CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the willingness of voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must return its mandate immediately , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal managing director and campaign manager of the Green Party editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election champion gro@@ ans , when on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony , stands after the transition of the Green MEPs El@@ ke T@@ westen to CD@@ U without its own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in the SPD regional associations .
and no one knows what &apos;s next .
the mi@@ str@@ ust began with the un@@ expectedly significant defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , not more , comrades at that time cal@@ med down .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this then became - and indeed everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to go away , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te sli@@ pped the party smoothly .
the comrades were pain@@ stak@@ ingly ra@@ ging up again in the weeks after .
then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next depth .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader in the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus during the weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned .
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong , which one can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role on the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for some time now .
the survey results were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation in recent weeks .
the desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to grant him a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
on the other hand , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz did not at all .
for the time being , comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all to the rebel@@ li@@ ous parliam@@ ent@@ ar@@ ist T@@ enth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ enth puts her own care@@ ers on the interests of everyone else , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ enth has not been elected as a direct candidate for her individual , but has been elected to parliament on the national list of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens , according to Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , compla@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ v@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters welcome four years ago : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate into the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member is distor@@ ting the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for local people III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
on Wednesday Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of STE@@ G urban development informed about this on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there are sens@@ ations in the area of san@@ itation .
back then , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg adopted two thirds of the total funding amount .
in the development area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous restructuring is a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to encourage the development of the interior and not only to open new building areas .
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that it will be a san@@ itation area III .
the sum of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 euros from the country , the rest of the community feel .
how does a rehabilitation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will , as sh@@ ind@@ ler continue , investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned territory interest is in general interest .
if necessary , the territorial limits may be postpon@@ ed again .
the STE@@ G represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working relationships and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per piece of property .
the refurb@@ ishment area would then finally be established as a stat@@ ute .
the funding period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock of the survey , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the aim of the statutes shall be as much as possible , so that the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that each commun@@ e had to carry out the said screening tests .
it is about assessing the urban@@ istic mis@@ understand@@ ings and deciding when to rehabil@@ itate and to what extent .
for the respective property there will also be a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sensi@@ bility and make himself a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project is the involvement of those involved .
this is why there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it is about the structural condition and the renovation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; budget and flat arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , division and inhabitants of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it must be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , gr@@ ind first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funding for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the conclusion some photos of the project &quot; Centre II &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; tasty &quot; refurb@@ ishment .
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip in order to get in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the palaces of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle .

the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a na@@ vy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that produced American production last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military reports to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter produced in Connec@@ tic@@ ut was on display next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire truck from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy commander of naval aviation .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note also adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
the recordings provided by TI@@ ME did not reveal whether a second flight crew was required in the end .
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave a push for reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ strain government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to request their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump performed an investigation in February when the president &apos;s plane was in front of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compla@@ ining about the use of the president &apos;s aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is delighted with the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to dep@@ ose US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ res .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was one of the training needs of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Heli@@ kop@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man for Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget awards for the Pres@@ idential Awards , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
unit Chron@@ icle records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study conducted in 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of helicop@@ ters for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky job
the runner @-@ up of the Second Tennis League matches the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
in spite of the five games still flaw@@ less , the runner @-@ up of the Second World Tennis League has gained the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high North ensure above all .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ swi@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ i .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man active at the Chall@@ enger event in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man does not get to the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec will be at his first assignment this season .
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he was to be present in Kiel , as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both The Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also move into the team again .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary who was the number one of the Junior World R@@ ank@@ ings in January 2016 , someone from the coaching staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay will fill the cad@@ re .
how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress put in a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional regulations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ amed the US thrust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft suggests pun@@ ishing European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the O@@ MV , which jointly with other European companies , have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea supply North Stream 2 .
the threats are enormous .
however , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump ought to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put in the center of the hit series by Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , who reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , Net@@ fli@@ x &apos;s series is far from over .
the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the world &apos;s rich@@ est drug trade organization : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company &quot; only operate with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

role : the city provides 46 kitchen aid workers
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch@@ time again .
with strong contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city day@@ care centers the clock is turned back .
the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) as of September 1st .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cooking cooling .
the city runs 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time .
last year , there were 28@@ 00 children sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are served 45 week@@ days eat at the K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care , if children remain till 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service from 1st September : they heat up the delivered food , supplement it with salad , raw food and fruit , portions of the meal individually , give off the meal , clean up , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as sevent@@ een groups - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now a part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ ie says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - is done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical way in terms of cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign exchange for the city .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re @-@ set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for about 750 people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban issued threats against an election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , for the first time , the elections will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

men trying to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to the police information , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2 : 55 a.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but went on with her friends .
as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the cell phone and the girl &apos;s necklace , which , however , failed .

G@@ MB concern over investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow over the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , which apart from other products , Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ beast requested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; express concern that financing for modernis@@ ing production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is concerned by our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metropol@@ itan area , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross just received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it because we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and in@@ secure business climate , constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business sectors and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and fully . if our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the site of La Liga may interest you in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
in their persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t let down after spending a £ 18@@ 9 million offering to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the record of the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after its completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , though a source is close to the Catalan leader that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of the PS@@ G president three years ago ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i in 2014 , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti earlier this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price quot@@ ations for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car met him on his lane , so that he had to go to the right .
in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the crash barrier .
in the car , material damage was created .
the driver of the forthcoming car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the cycl@@ ist driver hadn &apos;t noticed the accident at all .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; announced after publication to the German press agency , he acquired an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Cathedral chap@@ lain Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false assessment of the processes at that time .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that in reporting of violence against the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; double standards &quot; would be measured .
in regard to the ass@@ aults in Regensburg , no one is doub@@ t@@ ful that it is a &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful act &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ pi@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ pi@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;re welcome to go to the church and this is a frozen food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; wounds were a normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed .
Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared in connection with reports of abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber who was commissioned by the German lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been used .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the pun@@ ishments for the students could be more severe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many victims over@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( R@@ atz@@ inger ) has reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence at the shelter of Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one , many students raise their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became pal@@ p@@ able when a cathedral spar@@ row did not bring top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present at all .
he has just once dedicated eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also occurred outside his sphere of influence .
at best you can repro@@ ach him , learn from it too late or have taken the first hints not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um , on which it worked , was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the wide majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent record , describes him as &quot; warm hearted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; intel@@ li@@ gible , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to flood break@@ downs .
the fact that he did not only kne@@ el with chairs and cast the keys on the floor , but also par@@ don@@ ed ears and che@@ ek@@ y boys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted even years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the question@@ able time , in the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as with teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state high school .
compared to what it is about in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , they are , of course , Bag@@ at@@ ella .
one wonders whether it is not rather with its fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed upon him .
many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently at the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , in connection with the report , much has been reported about the issue of abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger put any involvement or complic@@ ity in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ en@@ cap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an affected person for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are silent .
if they were not even entrusted with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the cul@@ pr@@ its professionally .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students evaluate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael hes@@ emann : a question@@ able pup@@ il phr@@ ased it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that it is calculated ... to have opened hum@@ bly or more clearly or even more than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report concludes with the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the investigation , it was not possible to confirm that the students and / or their surroundings believed themselves in the run @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity .
in this way , it cannot be accused of having prevented or fet@@ tered it .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these vile crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex@@ tor@@ tion of violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ en@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in reporting to a huge che@@ ek of sexual abuse and non @-@ violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is again a mis@@ use of the report .
there is a clean separation between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violent exc@@ esses as well as other accus@@ ations .
in addition , the report treats events from the time since 1945 , even from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole horrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were tor@@ mented and portrayed , and suffered tremend@@ ously , all took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with those Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to see when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was , like most of the witnesses , emphasized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al &quot; states .
what was different in the gym@@ nasi@@ um gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims over@@ estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him in many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at most the repro@@ ach still remains to be looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently close the ears before the states ?
Michael hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral @-@ gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre @-@ school , the punishment will continue to be practiced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended an urgent intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as a criminal record in Bavaria already had been banned .
before that , they took possession of a legal grey zone , as each of us knows well .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the suffer@@ ers might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the ad@@ missible limit was exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
it was only in 1980 that the death penalty was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time .
how do you see this ?
Michael hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess was right .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was destroyed in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls .
it &apos;s all so aw@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work out .
but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipline and punishment , therefore , to attract ear and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his Regensburg day has George R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of Prü@@ ff@@ rebu@@ ke come into speech ?
Michael hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI tells from his perspective that the domain cats played a minor role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he was a strict regi@@ ment there .
but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of space , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and sweets alone one does not make a big vo@@ cal@@ ist from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys and every success , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people have you experienced as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations with her book ?
Michael hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and is always experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep believing and hear@@ tless people from whom one can &apos;t imagine that he could do something too much .
I get regular contact with him today , 23 years after his retirement , regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he &apos;s almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him until today , that he was once strict with them , are clearly in the minority .
today , most of the domain cats are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and taught them the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lovely dis@@ respect@@ ful person to whom they still look today and which they almost worship .
and please , once again clearly : everything you repro@@ ach him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man only because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him .
now he would be able to command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without whom nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen without having to leave the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
