<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivate the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich encourages exciting stories to days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to get upset before, because the car Navi instead of a strained road showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bayern of the state government, are anything but up-to-date, but it is therefore very enlightening.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large map of the map, more detailed maps were incorporated into cities and municipalities, so-called documents.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the specifications of the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical survey of Bavaria in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops ended with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, they were the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavarian map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max. Joseph pushed the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian surveying administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The composition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / present is most impressive, for example, by the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming a smaller-part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-written numbered plots from the so-called "Urals" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no more farmers there, but small gardeners of the plant" "" "Land in Sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the place of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the original position, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one not only reads the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich District IrrenInstitution" "" "Auf der Auer Lüften" "" "was founded in 1858 / 59." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with King Ludwig II's death.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, finished the accusations of the so-called" "" "Irren" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the County reunification in Haarlem in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar Amper Hospital, Munich-Ost, is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in Munich's Salesanum on the premises of the former municipal institute.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">To the west lies the football field of the TSV Munich East, East residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in an architectural style reminiscent of the original construction of the Irrenian asylum, which had been destroyed during the Second World War." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main square" "", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs broke many holes in the inner city in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017, the ground-breaking ceremony for the second railroad race track took place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slide bar, the old Munich-map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farmers issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State Missouri, which is to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special care when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in the entire state and be noted here," says the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to obtain discrimination complaints, as well as the state prosecuting authorities that aim disproportionately against minorities, prompted the group to issue travel warnings, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "they are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," "" "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist attacks against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline while travelling through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report of the Office of Missouri's Office of Attorney General, which shows that black motorists in the state will be halted 75 percent more frequently than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and associates what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be prepared to bring in the deposit money or let their relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the crime-crime report of the FBI, which classify the state regarding the number of such violations to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws that commit local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further road provisioning after ACLU's view.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">"" "" "" "the fence project is elementary" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishermen's Weidejon project is a success project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">Members of the CDU, Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac, have created a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU local association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Landgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk cows and also many young animals and is home to five apartments Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is the alternative marketing way for him for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste is exclusively Regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also chairman of BLHV, he described the fence project as" "" "fundamental importance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profit on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, many have to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "emphasized Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead to biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the significance of the fence project and is glad of the leader support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare the farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have are the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to carry on their operation," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Because of the promotion the farmers often stand in the critique</seg>
<seg id="84">Over the course of 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open up area is 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of €71 500, half was supported by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a good job, without farmers and women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss also stated:" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state-of-the-art production of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">Moreover, the area to be enclosed may not be smuggling (inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the 2018 Fishermen's trombone project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently under construction.</seg>
<seg id="96">The total open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans estimate them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitters would have caught him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he touched their importance, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller Acosta complained," "" "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem which you refer to that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is pertinent, but as he formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's vibrating words, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, / your troubled masses who yearn to breathe freely, the miserable waste of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better to see on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in the slings of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the ties between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exilantes.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the Coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early Neoconservatism, bringing the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch will not illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is rather unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is completely and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">Lazarus's great fanciful act consisted in seeing her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrifying journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue says to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this of course is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wish to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not to enlighten the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team.</seg>

<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butovo - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected Team captain.</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medalists, competing at their fifth world championships in the 400 m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The runner-up runner Muir leads on this path and last year he set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch for a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that she is "hugely proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team but in some cases also join medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being special about the team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">What is my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the heat up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the papers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He harmed in criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>

<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that's why the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivoll, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his electors and play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, which is called officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who swing online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>

<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not water-filled, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news release "The Post."</seg>

<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one would have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical body items or to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>

<seg id="197">This shouldn't be so difficult.</seg>

<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>

<seg id="367">According to Phelim Kine, the Assistant Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis electoral campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report about the most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papism: visa denial and a black list," he said in an explanation.</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government largely remains confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent claimed they were belatedly discovered that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey conducted by more than 1,000 people, carried out by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also noted that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of millennials were compared to less than 15 percent, the members of Generation X were.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common objects that were deliberately caused by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent reported to knowingly carry items with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many inadvertently brought smuggled goods through airport security and how many had intentionally done it.</seg>

<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far underscored that a part of the customers has already retracted their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumphant figures for sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed a different, less glamorous figure for the first time in the publication of the latest quarterly report: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">During the past few months, Musk often had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk has been dreaming: of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics repeatedly pointed out that this is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely.</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 such non-binding reservations have been made, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss doesn't believe that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models should be taken together - 500,000, 2020 a million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1,800 reservations are currently available per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order a Model 3 today, you must expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand new production lines tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche, a Serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historical St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tumblings to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village treasure."</seg>
<seg id="471">In the year 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Wuerttemberg document of origin: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the nearby parish church to Tumlingen including the "Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, on the Tumlinger Berg, besides the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard, to which the church or patronate law belonged, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As described in the description of the Oberdorf Freudenstadt from 1858, beside the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still to be seen in the village of Tumlingen today, the "mountain" is the third, the dominant settler-centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating from the period around the year 1600 are supporting these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from Early Middle Ages.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also bequeath this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Connected with this was the right to appoint a parish priest or to propose a new parish priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two were broken at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bell sets were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were stockpiling near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out pulpit and church seats and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from radio schweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarion church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year 1834 a storm broke the church tower and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-tower existing today remained as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are the successor to Dieter Dockhorn as successor to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">The organizers invite friends and supporters of Tumlineage on Sunday, July 16th, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is designed by the combo of Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>

<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval on December 30, 2016, because at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed in Viersen at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a new subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build on an area at the Boisheimer Nette the construction of four 200 meters high wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city Viersen is indirectly involved, had leased lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare property.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the establishment of four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is expected to be covered - this is equivalent to about a fifth of the electricity needs of all Viersener households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersens City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a stake in a wind farm in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a vaulted concrete arch bridge, clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has meanwhile arrived in the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach opened on Wednesday morning on the northern side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fortification, which is also used as an operating path.</seg>
<seg id="919">On Friday, a 2,20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it deals with finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">The laying of cables through the structure in Lauterbach requires a special feeling of tact.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable, connected to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish first had to be fished.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA because the managerial organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules that have been launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG must eventually prove that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without large losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG certainly can make the money loose so that Neymar underwrites and will bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the funding of the team through the energy rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counteract legitimate income sources which allow them the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA presidents in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations, who had taken enormous debts in their pursuit of success, effectively cheated and risked trying to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debts of clubs to the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses amounting to EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen in favour of the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for the accounting period over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the revenue streams for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros can be reported in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of US sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the hardest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (back then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs who could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsoring was to exceed the standard market sets, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor of the PSA was raised by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the World Cup 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar's World Cup will be ambassadors and could easily find out such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to every attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year need to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after the signature.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and it tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's latter ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American Sports Tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state funded by a society.</seg>

<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic idiot - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues from Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living a great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced himself from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with it and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5-feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but placing the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille Lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can lock the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforcement, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is counterproductive, so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat can transform itself by a good design and an increased square metre number of something standard in something completely amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a confrontation over one of Victorias's biggest real estate empire worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp argument about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a store at Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for $85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and the De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her late father, Colin-Paul is described as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De LUTIS family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul roughly one-third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court case states that this means that Colin property has a value of $316 million and Paul worth 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the appraisals proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle for control over the existing business - Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her dead husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first denim of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began West co there when he was "in my last years of the High School when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS Group, claiming that Mark has paid $10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">Both Luke and Mark are, so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation. "</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin was very restrained, although he was a former AFL board member and following a biography from Eddie McGuire in 2015, the best friend of the TV stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>

<seg id="1388">The new chief of staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met at his first working day with senior employees, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump in White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "when candidate Trump was annoyed for unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be persuaded," "" "said former election campaigner Sam Nunberg in February about Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "" "" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping track of Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant lobbying." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump Breaks Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know others - that trumps withtweets without their intervention would have contained even more fuel.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump didn't send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed to keep him away from him a few times, then their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it from calling out Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to give the president doubtful information for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former platformer officials say that dump like a volcano can react to negative press clippings, especially those with embarrassed leaks, and that he stiffens out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by Gottar.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to chicans or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he had voiced false accusations in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "jump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, which receives the pump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente operating company ltd. on April 13, 2014, about 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenues from the tourist tax were also lost.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective shelter, which caused controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time the decision was not undisputed in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested people at the time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: U.S. Special Issuer sets Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special Agent Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury upon a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks, the panel accepted the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "calling on people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reports that there are already first invitations from the committee in connection with a meeting between the eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time being specifically involved in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Truls campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigators focus on several men who acted as advisers to the republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also scrutinized more and more private and business connections.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump had personally moved to the centre and allege the accusation whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to check present evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether the prosecution is to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury is therefore also called 'buntings'.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are usually switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">"" "" "" "the body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor in order to invite individuals to take part under oath." ""</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, invitations were issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, it was said in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trump counselors and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former chief commander Paul Manafort joined the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the substitution show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he would act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">However, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the integration of the body at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for president Trump is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the president on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the topic gives the democrats a way to" "" "feel good, because they have nothing else they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb said in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this usually works in secret, he emphasised.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House endorses all measures that accelerated the work of the Special Agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey told three times that he won't be established against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the declaration.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Because of this rump, accusations against Trump have become loud, he wanted to obstruct the judiciary.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey announced in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the then National Security Advisor Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the Special Agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate Affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on urging the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several Senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the departure of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">In total, however, for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region, writes the US research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C horseshoe.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeira floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It is growing more and more into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeira is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this coward, the balance of waxes and abortions was disturbed some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI research scientist, Daniela Jansen, writes a complete Shelf.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelven is in danger as the front edge has never gone as far back as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and can be broken if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of the ice shelf and the iceberg does not heighten the sea level because they float on the water and ice so much water as it does after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could increase the sea level, however, only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C horseshoe is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it falls regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the most graceful retreat ever since the records began," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists it is disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelven will grow back or fall back in the long run and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, "Our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Although these researchers do not trace the departure of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, however, many kingfunders of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tip of the Antarctica stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic ice surface has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and thus counts to the areas in which the temperature is the quickest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the personnel</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU demands to come out of the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs were built in the administration.</seg>

<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann circuit.</seg>

<seg id="1562">The aim is to not only cover short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counteract the candidate shortage in a future-oriented manner, that is to say.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate internally and externally, demonstrate concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, call CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">The circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a real" "" "contest of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter peoples, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint proposal with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long for a big surprise in the circle-day when he publicly challenged the personnel costs cap and baffled the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all the possibilities to be verified that allow an exit from the local employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the county government should strive with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the revolving cities - a house tariff," "" "said peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually foresees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money exist only if one changes to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up, in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team effectively collaborated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express itself in extensive allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the rescue of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on social media." ""</seg>

<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had monitored the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that its crew will take dinghy migrants on board, which are supplied directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The crew is suspected of taking over the authority of the Italian Coastguard who oversees rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventra must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs participating in search and rescue missions have agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring any "essential changes or obstructions" of their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, Nobel Peace Laureates Organisation is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>

<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first federal states that are increasingly engaged in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1625">With celebrity E-athletes under contract, it is possible to be more often present on these markets online than to send to Asia only once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In e-sport, computer games such as League of Legends, "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or "Football Simulation" are fought at competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long established themselves, in which the pros play against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And by 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobert has also been dealing with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before Audi's announcement BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW president said the company believes that "there are smarter options than travel restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers to install equipment for the neutralisation of exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of inciting the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">Companies are trying to avoid the shortcomings of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation equipment that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but ride back in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>

<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the investigation could seriously affect Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer is contributing disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was at times one of the most publicized cartoonists, the nostrils of his characters are his trademarks.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message:" "" "laughter," "" "because there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he suggested himself as a draughtsman for congratulation cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came to the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the disease-borne insects, which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions, great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change, which in spring has brought much less rain and a lot more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small Zikade, a microbacterium that transmits the dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are very many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant ohren with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either lacking or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the salary list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the mayhem of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no pause for violence, and as the bodies pile up throughout the country, more and more journalists are growing: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto joined forces in December 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspiration for Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep although his presence is everywhere - a big picture of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hanging on the facade of the Rioodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a public prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Feodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are uncomforting and although the terrain is still more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we all distrust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in Culiacan's capital.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to go a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelve Flow."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of ornate, two-storeyed mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "calm" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Feodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the children, suspected aisle members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newskiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined together with five colleagues for the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without bumping on the drug toxin problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">With time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting researches without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award 'of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to live on," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ Award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task that you will notice as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodolce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret starting and landing ways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"" "" "" "these things were not allowed," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trusting his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of Feodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">Days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Feodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers, which the governor himself described as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has written on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous boxing writer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group residing in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost the entire century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "Guzman escaped a military attack." ""</seg>

<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office is dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers which protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snatched a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist at the Office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have grown louder by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on footpaths and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accuses the authorities to spy on journalists and destroy them because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-journalism" he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "in the past year, the media group" "" "Articulo 19" "" "has assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and civil servants." ""</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed out of place by the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>

<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>

<seg id="1937">Researchers have discovered that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used an shielding technique known as counterbalancing, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to better mix in his surroundings and evade his enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta marksmelli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaur was hunted by the dinosaurs by eating meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this nodose-carrier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the besieged armored dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food-justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>

<seg id="2060">"" "one question came to Ferrell:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a history that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death row inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other indigenous people followed the Whose Streets team in the years following Browns's shooting.</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferris's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter Movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media after the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identifies itself as gay.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the south end of the pedestrian zone divides the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>

<seg id="2094">While proponents suggest that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, and the other businesses profit from it, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces can be seen - white, black and brown ones, almost imperceptible, hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year custodial sentence after signing secret diplomatic messages about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transunion and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since puberty, was convicted for 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">The prison was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning sits visibly on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just returned from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg on a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detained muse became unequal brims which changed several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future where President Chelating would convert judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama actually only few days after the book was published, Manning's release would demand for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is conducting a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">"" "when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" "" "things happen for a certain reason." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her oversized signature (the "i" in her surname is provided with a heart) at the end of the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand-füßler of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological respects, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome will not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>

<seg id="2155">This was also target-oriented, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2162">A common warning system, published by the Chicago Police Department, states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene of the event, and detectives are investigating the stitches as murder, while the police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubitarist, the vice-president for university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem should now be praised and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warrens's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>

<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities will help find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, which had just received a mysterious tip stating that something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA's timetable for compliance with the code that describes the criteria for the replacement of RUSADA and recently published on the organization's website.</seg>

<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria listed in the list stipulates that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "in reference to the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has got an error." ""</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the polls did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was simply never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of human resource start-ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide staff anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow managers to circumvent the C-Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel with GLINT in the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT, this wish is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance business could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Converick, the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">You have recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Converick enables companies to send tailor-made "pulses" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline where employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, Convercent has deployed for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company sets up Convercent, problems that were previously covered by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internship - can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," "" "said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group from Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders against employment juridical disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take care of ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convertices offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that supports venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convertible received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than previously.</seg>
<seg id="2240">High salaries and interesting projects are only used in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you can give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that has heard their voices and that the work they do is worthwhile, they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convertible and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are running well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement following the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks staff for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough or not at all, this can lead to disappointments and demoticulate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4.000 feedback, you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow employees ask," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so rett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after receiving feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run it leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," Vitrano said.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 11 o'clock when a lot of UCLA players chat on one side of the team's new practice areas on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have pulled off their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team these unworking minutes represent a lunch break.</seg>
<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three hour practice before returning to the Wassermann Football Center next morning at 6: 30 am.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday for Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 a.m. in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players.</seg>

<seg id="2274">Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-1980 and 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshireman with a predilection for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes that is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted cupids on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape care, gardeners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the clerks just started to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said," Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting what possessed: "you might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all the way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to plunge into English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uproar that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century depicted his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed to be quite Gauner, making money and spending money for things they could not afford.</seg>

<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged ties to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wire puller of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2374">Over the past few months over the future of the race ticket has been fought over and over again.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The ascension of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't become even more crazier in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey at the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs, and select everything from the robot eye color over the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it will be more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepford woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBendx robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy gold sex robot developed by True Companion, featuring pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible," enthuses the True Companion website.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step towards Frigid (means: resisting) Farrah, disturbs one of the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website was compatible True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something Dunkless and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR is noticing their rising popularity, they remain tentatively on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are appearing in a time in which the rights of women are globally threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the swallowed body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump era that political splits that polarized U.S. electorate have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump selecting relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all restrain all of us to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noted is the power of mumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftist denser, who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship, with whom she fought for decades for politics, suddenly and very odd on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This certainly is a good thing for the dining table, but it is in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and trump, we refer to the spooky possibility that one day his bibs will no longer be thrown away." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the Right Wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness compared to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in town, we brought our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of New York's carousels, and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the klimbling music imparts this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">As many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park Karussell is still a strange magical experience, since two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store apologized grievingly, while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius misplaced with chest pain from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wrists, which he reportedly suffered from the prison authorities in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Because of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by firing her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder who hid herself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year custodial sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National prosecuting authority said that she will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius risks that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no capital punishment in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2462">On Tuesday evening, school director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen.</seg>

<seg id="2467">But the hope of making a chicken out of it was broken, and the eagle stretched out its wings on a high mountain.</seg>
<seg id="2468">After that the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken tail.</seg>
<seg id="2469">The hens danced with the young gockles carrying the cylinders to the bet.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims precisely the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the sufferers are normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant colon.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the intestines are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not invade the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice is found that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. Cruteri and a diet rich in tryptophan increases tolerable, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also assists people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan searched for a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but had not had this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in mice with immune cells, but were lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were created by L. Cruteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria acted on the immune system, the researchers L. Cruteri left in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's feed, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same tolerancerous cells as mice, and that most of us L. Cruteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. Cruteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>

<seg id="2672">Who wants to renovate his house in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">On Wednesday Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG urban development informed about this on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event Schindler gave a review of what happened so far.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there are sensations in the area of sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg adopted two thirds of the total funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the development area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the previous restructuring is a "success project" - it is important to encourage the development of the interior and not only to open new building areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Regierungspräsidium Karlsruhe received the information that it will be a sanitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The sum of funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500,000 euros from the country, the rest of the community feel.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a rehabilitation area develop?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "you will, as shindler continue, investigate where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether in the planned territory interest is in general interest.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the territorial limits may be postponed again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme" "" "Social City" "", "in which the restructurings would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, improving living and working relationships and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is per piece of property.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The refurbishment area would then finally be established as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The funding period for funding has been running since January 1, 2017 until April 30, 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September this year, however, it would only be possible to take stock of the survey, within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the aim of the statutes shall be as much as possible, so that the restructurings can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then declared that each commune had to carry out the said screening tests.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about assessing the urbanistic misunderstandings and deciding when to rehabilitate and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">For the respective property there will also be a memorandum in the land register.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will come again to sensibility and make himself a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project is the involvement of those involved.</seg>
<seg id="2698">This is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">"" "the yellow questionnaire is the" "" "building and property sheet" "" "in which it is about the structural condition and the renovation views." ""</seg>

<seg id="2701">"" "the blue" "" "operating bow" "" "can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building." ""</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, it must be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that produced American production last month will cost taxpayers according to the military reports to the TIME Magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter produced in Connecticut was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy commander of naval aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note also adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>

<seg id="2864">The site of La Liga may interest you in Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">In their persecution of Neymar, Paris Saint-Germain won't let down after spending a £189 million offering to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the record of the world record?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After its completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar has forced his way out, though a source is close to the Catalan leader that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned of the PSG president three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players, we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressed interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti earlier this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price quotations for Neymar.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "the final report on the abuse scandal in the Domspatzen" "" "Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," announced after publication to the German press agency, he acquired an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Cathedral chaplain Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their false assessment of the processes at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised that in reporting of violence against the Domspatzen, "double standards" would be measured.</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the assaults in Regensburg, no one is doubtful that it is a "shameful and shameful act" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," said the author Lucetta Scarpiia, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarpiia." ""</seg>

<seg id="2898">She also pointed out that in her youth "wounds were a normal pedagogical means" to be done with cheeky children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared in connection with reports of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "because all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber who was commissioned by the German lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Domspatzen" "" "Domspatzen" "" "were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been used.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishments for the students could be more severe.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims overestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him in many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen (Ratzinger) has relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence at the shelter of Regensburger Domspatzen," gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for one, many students raise their" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as choleriker and perfectionist, who became palpable when a cathedral sparrow did not bring top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger is present at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just once dedicated eight pages and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best you can reproach him, learn from it too late or have taken the first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatz gymnasium, on which it worked, was felt by virtually all respondents as" "" "redemption," "" "" heaven "" "" and "" "" better world "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">This is how the wide majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent record, describes him as "warm hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "intelligible," as extremely good-natured teachers, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to flood breakdowns.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only kneel with chairs and cast the keys on the floor, but also pardoned ears and cheeky boys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted even years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such education methods were widespread in the questionable time, in the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is about in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, they are, of course, Bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not rather with its fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed upon him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working diligently at the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, much has been reported about the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger put any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domencapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said an affected person for the others," "" "everything was very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not even entrusted with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the culprits professionally.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students evaluate Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael hesemann: a questionable pupil phrased it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that it is calculated... to have opened humbly or more clearly or even more than to their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report concludes with the clear result:" "" "in the course of the investigation, it was not possible to confirm that the students and / or their surroundings believed themselves in the run-up." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">In terms of sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In this way, it cannot be accused of having prevented or fettered it.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these vile crimes, as unfortunately occurred in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media was much of" "" "extortion of violence" "" "in the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domenkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report" "" "Look away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed in reporting to a huge cheek of sexual abuse and non-violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is again a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violent excesses as well as other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats events from the time since 1945, even from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were tormented and portrayed, and suffered tremendously, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to see when they were already at the Domspatz gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "the theme of" "" "preschool" "" "was, like most of the witnesses, emphasized." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic power.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims overestimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him in many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most the reproach still remains to be looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral-gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "in the pre-school, the punishment will continue to be practiced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended an urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as a criminal record in Bavaria already had been banned.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took possession of a legal grey zone, as each of us knows well.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the sufferers might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the admissible limit was exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">It was only in 1980 that the death penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael hesemann: we historians talk about the "pitfalls of anachronism," i.e. the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what was destroyed in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all so awful and I'm glad that it will finally work out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of discipline and punishment, therefore, to attract ear and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his Regensburg day has George Ratzinger reproduced in conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of Prüffrebuke come into speech?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI tells from his perspective that the domain cats played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't know that he was a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of space, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and sweets alone one does not make a big vocalist from rebellious boys and every success, regardless of which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced as Georg Ratzinger during the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and is always experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep believing and heartless people from whom one can't imagine that he could do something too much.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I get regular contact with him today, 23 years after his retirement, regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today, most of the domain cats are grateful to him that he has enriched their lives and taught them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovely disrespectful person to whom they still look today and which they almost worship.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: everything you reproach him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man only because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now he would be able to command a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without whom nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen without having to leave the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
