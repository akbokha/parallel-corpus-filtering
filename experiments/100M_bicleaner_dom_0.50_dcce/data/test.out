a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother stated that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the court medical department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigation is running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who had previously worked as a cook in Boston , had caught his dream job as Koch in the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed by his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
connecting his way with his family was to always cook us something to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the issue of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in a drawer
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
this has clearly made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , TV with ro@@ cker D@@ utt and Mexican food , is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asks the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new movie &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting on August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the World Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their evening , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feeding @-@ trou@@ ghs .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and so the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was once again near horses .
he had to run with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even ho@@ ver for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German sports aid presented the Golden Ste@@ ering Py@@ ramid to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala .
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen has already bl@@ amed him .
the 18th prize @-@ winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master champion has been included in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winners include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ echter Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping coach Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two U.S. Pres@@ idential candidates are at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical basis .
he , on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and cau@@ tions how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wanted to tax the economy and regulate his death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will deal with regulations massi@@ vely , and he will be strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
therefore taxes for the rich would increase , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be invested in that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump and Clinton , almost verb@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the re@@ public@@ ans &quot; state @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ can Party .
so there could be partial discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA again .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris Climate Protection Agreement will denoun@@ ce it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , Clinton is reluct@@ ant to expand and demand renew@@ ables with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be it . &quot;
but not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart .
T@@ PP , the trans@@ lu@@ cent trade agreement , do not want to sign the two .
at the same time , both of us don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply better protect American jobs .
they are to be paid even better , says Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must go up , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens , is about to boost growth .
his critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least wants to demand from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; flight : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who fle@@ es has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in the arm .
with big eyes he looks curi@@ ously into the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich @-@ based Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe .
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor mur@@ ders , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the escape , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , for example , demand sexual action for a bottle of water is not r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who think that when they come in Germany , they &apos;re mistaken , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and at worst ab@@ used .
this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich north are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what was experienced because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , I need more accommodations just for them , challenge B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the placement of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone escap@@ ing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man for the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are in some common shel@@ ters floors or own houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately by men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important for men and women to be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can become - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush that it gives to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around us that we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ahr says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily open a second home .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new work @-@ fighting activities
representatives of the assistance physicians have called on their union to appro@@ ve new work @-@ fighting activities in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more action measures beginning in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC stated that ministers agreed to take care of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistance physicians and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; persist@@ ently calm , &quot; which led to the rejection of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Committee has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and request official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating industrial action that begins in early September .
the disputes led to the fact that assistance physicians struck six times this year , the first general out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the BM@@ A driver , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contract terms that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared the BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians and medical students that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month @-@ long war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile looked narrow@@ ly and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had nothing to forget .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of being dropped in the back of Russia .
the crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the c@@ ous@@ ins is difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted assault on Ankara .
it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
at the most serious were the alle@@ gations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear .
Russia could win a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of his office during a failed state coup last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght at the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports were allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ č@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious about the West as it looks at the response to the attempted power tak@@ eover as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the s@@ nail emp@@ o of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara , claiming that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat he demanded support for the elected bodies of state .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that feel viol@@ ated and badly treated by the West and now unite .
yet despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks the two pres@@ idents went out at the press conference saying that they had not even stri@@ pped the subject .
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for Scotland customers
according to the board of directors of the Bank , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and rescu@@ ed eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on more national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised headquarters and stock quotes will change to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the retail business , which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and staff in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor &apos;s brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I now say that we do not pursue global goals but local objectives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the Bank of brands , because how do we focus within ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .

D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double in New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th of profit
the Jo@@ ckey Swiss franc D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he placed on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three times winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who first won at G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he wins the victory on dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys hit the milestone in obstacle racing - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few met before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect , which differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been enth@@ r@@ alled for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6.000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already made nearly 30 years of winner in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in As@@ cot , in 1996 , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he had difficulties in the beginning when he returned from his six @-@ month lock@@ out , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fingers and return to his best form .
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his age of at least fifty years .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expectedly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est trust for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , Putin said without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been the representative of Ivan@@ ov since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it reads ( in Russian ) that he later was the chief of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the govern@@ ment@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activities as head of state with regard to bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV broad@@ caster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov had asked to leave his post and to have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin for a long time and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men claimed that the chief of staff res@@ ig@@ ned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who once was praised as a potential President would once again lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to entr@@ ust some compla@@ ining items for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V adopted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , as a third term of Putin would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , who produce the series , announced in a joint statement his dis@@ miss@@ al .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is published , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , is expected to be released at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who had previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od over the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a release published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the twel@@ fth season will be broadcast on September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around Pis@@ ces , which landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
an inhabit@@ ant of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that there could be sand e@@ els in the 75 f@@ ishings that were sp@@ un off by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of two inches long fishes .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now tied to fi@@ fe
the € 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017
engineers connected the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - meaning that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that are approaching completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 be@@ vel ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the entire deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of the future @-@ oriented high@@ - and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances that the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck the alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat turned around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging by a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat motor had an emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has kept watch over these men today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
badly injured - a man stab@@ s to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 @-@ year old had gotten the key to the apartment in order to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the alcohol @-@ sty@@ led perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ators .
while the 50 @-@ year old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother .
she then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
she could not persu@@ ade him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the ex @-@ life partner of the man .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sne@@ aked up his sister aside and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is building Braunschweig &apos;s affordable apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : in the future , investors should be taken more strongly into duty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can we respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable homes in the coming years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next meeting session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
until now , a regulation is missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Christoph Kü@@ bel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build urban areas , you must pay 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
the main point in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann said : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the housing as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development program , which will cost millions of dollars and still needs to be financed , is intended to provide incentives for incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left is still willing to impose tough@@ er conditions on investors .
despite this , Brat@@ mann , a worsen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market began .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one look at the loss of further 1,@@ 300 affordable homes , whose support will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , the planned political spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ of @-@ date ties from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of buying apartments back in the price bracket .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved in one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
because in the western city , deadlines are running at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased , one gets away from the goal of the so @-@ called thorou@@ gh@@ fare .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be still movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although this has focused on more construction sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about catching people from the sofa and making them more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to television , then video games and last on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters created initially for video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; can be captured .
a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the tur@@ key and jump@@ ed for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person re@@ treats each day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ogram , an Apple Watch app that tracks 35@@ ,000 users , told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people who train 30 minutes each day jump@@ ed from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees raw data to increase performance .
many public health awareness campaigns that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; be active every day &quot; stum@@ bled upon deaf ears , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable .
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
whoever push@@ es sports regularly reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
as always there are m@@ app@@ ish game corruption , which must always complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough occurred .
even if smartphone apps such as Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
with Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos; success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people in the hunt to be more active , more active and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant all along the line .
and now finally Olympic Champion .
19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast rolled into a multi @-@ campaign title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team @-@ mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a .
the American Women Sim@@ one Bil@@ a tur@@ nt on the Swedish beam during the solo multi @-@ campaign of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ ateral is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and the fifth one , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end .
this success sets them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world champi@@ ons - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she &quot; is the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was expected to last a final test in Brazil , a competition which did not go so much between cheap and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered disappointment .

Bil@@ a took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clam@@ ation mark at the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although it insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during its long journey , it is not really true .
part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is att@@ un@@ ed to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and trained by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion in the gym , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost a competition for competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will continue as long as it wishes .
even though Mu@@ staf@@ a slightly led through two turns , the picture mur@@ mu@@ red .
Swedish beam and ground ur@@ ns - in which it holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ ks .
she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the wooden beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was another .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly when she expected her ending - pure form@@ ality - and tears poured in fine glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ a .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , which is called &quot; grand@@ ma , &quot; had a lead .
after her so@@ aking , she threw kis@@ ses to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as far as it is concerned , the rapidly expanding we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in mass kill@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who had killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass kill@@ ings of Phoenix while listening to the car and listening to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fired weapon while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police told that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y case , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which were owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
altogether , seven people were killed and two more injured in his@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincol@@ n .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ised because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a bul@@ let out of the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it will be better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his age , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I don &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has been left on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the aid of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year and he still can &apos;t speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund presents for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something before &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News spoke .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented a few characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and pre@@ dictions can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it &apos;s getting better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call for the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rain@@ falls .
numerous rivers in southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flooded its banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , shared that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand sacks increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone had demanded tens of thousands of sand sacks .
a flood warning system is used for large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturdays .
the weather forecast made it possible that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday while it still ra@@ ined in the Mobile area .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Island is a danger , as these rivers are only slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still hat@@ ched people from floo@@ ding in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were amongst those who were rescu@@ ed by glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , increases overnight .
he said that another step @-@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water f@@ lowed and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were held until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expanded rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities were considering ev@@ ac@@ uation directives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported a 13.@@ 75 inch ra@@ inf@@ all near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground was substantially wei@@ ghted by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and L@@ ess@@ ons in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a subsidiary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were now both flooded .
the leader of the community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets which were washed from the flood .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; as soon as the water starts to return , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed because of the flood and sand sacks were provided for the inhabitants to take part , hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported on Thursday as flooded , but on Friday none of them were reported .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police reports that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was aware of his transport to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pun@@ ched by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared with the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter that it is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot at German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating if one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently it had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been tra@@ cked back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , se@@ wed the scene of the scene .
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were recept@@ ac@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced Police Head@@ quarters Anthony G@@ inal@@ di the Police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police were re@@ port@@ edly re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by an ag@@ ger at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
she is re@@ covering and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic community in the tower and that for more than one reason .
first , I &apos;ve been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant yet .
and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lic@@ in , round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally mirrors the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gym@@ n@@ astic women was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gym@@ n@@ astic routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we do not see movement classes throughout the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . it is also the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and turns Tur@@ ner primarily in private gymnas@@ tics , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these sports clubs are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics .
we have to give the municipalities forth countless , young girls , who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to make a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access exercise training possible .
I founded my turn foundation 20 years ago .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for over 15,000 urban adolescents ( mainly black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest for the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks to Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , you have so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after having rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association &apos;s officials , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians voted in favour of voting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to forci@@ bly introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first veter@@ in@@ arians should receive a new contract , which contains changes to both night and weekend events to improve care at un@@ fortunate times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Committee spokes@@ man , announced last night in a communication with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed Treaty , in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and ab@@ duct it to meet all physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time is running out .
the BM@@ A &apos;s efforts to resolve disputes by discussions clas@@ h@@ ed with the government on account of reluct@@ ance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the suspension and address the concerns of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work @-@ fighting activities .
the last strike at the end of April saw an increase of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strip track .
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association officials .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ day pay for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant doctors who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS co @-@ workers , urged the assistance physicians to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work combat measures do nothing of little , but put strain on over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nur@@ ses and their families only wor@@ rying , distress and dis@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we have spoken to the Committee of Assistance physicians and responded positively to the concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that the continued positive engagement to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training c@@ ysts , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were in compliance with the agreement with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication , which can reduce the risk of heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulated medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form deposits .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots det@@ ach , it can flow through the blood stream and stop the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture Hel@@ ps Ele@@ ction Dest@@ ru@@ ction in Muslim Are@@ as
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report about corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to broad@@ ly ignor@@ ing widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities , as a devastating government report revealed today .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town councils to ignore electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off bands outside election boo@@ ths to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends voters to demonstrate their identity to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er only needs to name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger , if they release their vote to prevent someone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions by non @-@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only serves against electoral fraud , but also aims to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that comes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets electoral sc@@ andal in the east of London .
last year , a Special Court ruled that the acting mayor of Lut@@ on should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; per@@ ver@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the consequence of im@@ itation in which one person chooses somebody else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he was particularly alar@@ ming in the frau@@ dul@@ ent postal voting - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading out ways to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in its report , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence has been put in place that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity with regard to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists manipul@@ ate letter selection documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election harvest &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the poll@@ ing directory used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for automatic postal voting .
prohibition that political activists manipul@@ ate full postal voting and envel@@ opes from postal voting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up block@@ ades to set up elec@@ tive stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change of law , which reli@@ eves a charge of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Leg@@ isl@@ ative Law 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in election stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fy the training to ensure that the employees enforce the rule for voters to go to the election cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case there was no complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Elec@@ toral Court has declared Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man and his substitute for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high demands of the criminal procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the electoral registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judgment seat in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy to Kate Rad@@ ler double @-@ tra@@ der and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio are over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot who has turned out to be an impressive double @-@ female of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year old Olympic athlete is by far not the only athlete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger , at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that have more than a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood personalities .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has since his childhood compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ gerin on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after images on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking fellow , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the highlight of this year : the all@@ uring simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast , Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a , with her big , expressive eyes , should be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African float Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for many years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a hall@@ way higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot;
another lasting comparison has been drawn between tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal designer Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ es@@ ed by fans to resemble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US soccer star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alli@@ sts in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his testimony that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Canadian radio station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers were &quot; off as low &quot; and as &quot; a pig died &quot; during the race .
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m release relay .
Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; color , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , he went down like a low , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the chin@@ ese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which made it possible for Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
viewers across Canada quickly re@@ acted online , after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , in which many reported him
Twitter users weren &apos;t back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ don@@ ald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment has been broadcast on a swim performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in the people who replied to the B@@ emer@@ ald via Twitter
comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his exc@@ uses to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments
the network also quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed and gave out a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday night to our viewers and our followers in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to excuse me for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I referred to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

standing in the middle of the sales floor , she took a pair of under@@ pants out of the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she was just there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the trousers , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , rec@@ laimed and went out .
&quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b anyone watching - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how reluct@@ antly to think that someone would take under@@ pants back home , who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate going home with a new pair of under@@ pants and finding out that another woman had her and pulled out and didn &apos;t get washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect oneself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a little safer for you .
we talked with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
when you are approached from behind , you should turn around first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and get out of the gun line , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with the knee in the l@@ ath and twist , while the attack@@ er is cro@@ oked with pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they focus the weapon on him .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er cannot shoot .
at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and strike the attack@@ er on the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip , before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it does Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that if you are a smo@@ ker , it is saf@@ est to deliver your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sc@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller with@@ drew his immune system and pro@@ pul@@ sion of a serious test - by le@@ aking out some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travelling author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ stained his line on a euro note , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system .
before the lick of each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is letting himself be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the thought of le@@ aking the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health .
fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked was more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ el by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to railway stations to dish@@ washers from toilets , the task of the immune system was definitely below a sample .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to meet his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test coat showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ omet@@ ry number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their lumin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands exhibit one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick anything here because it &apos;s disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company is equi@@ pping Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; validation Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Give us Ian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking just about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had ordered him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ cial family destroyed before del@@ o@@ ving social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left her housing after a dele@@ tion with a damage amoun@@ ting to £ 50,000 because she had terr@@ orized her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ ati@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls had g@@ aping holes , wooden plan@@ ks were ri@@ pped up , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family were res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment would no longer be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be regarded as not as beautiful part Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cries , disputes and cur@@ es .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found .
in the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn
neighbours agreed that they saw them fighting on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing accompanied her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the det@@ ox@@ ic@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , En@@ forcement Administration En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , stated that it would have been ab@@ using the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown site of the community house waste and old toys were thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ vation is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing takes into account .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information they have provided .
I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbors and the message con@@ veys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , which is located in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ving on the floor
workers in the house administration will now have to sweep away rub@@ b@@ ish mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after having found himself guilty of possession of a class B drug in trade indul@@ gence .
she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the house walls were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will navigate ten@@ ant who do not adhere to the house rules
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told us that del@@ o@@ gi@@ vation is a clear warning to the other rent@@ ers who do not adhere to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches and those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal reloc@@ ated after an eff@@ er@@ ent military jet ski@@ ps beach
sun worshi@@ ppers at Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ craft aircraft flew an incredible crash flight
the Air Force showed that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists begin pan@@ i@@ cking when a ti@@ ph@@ er jet falls over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew close to the sun @-@ worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jump@@ ed up when they were understand@@ ably bound to worry about the noise of the bushes , without first seeing what was coming on them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers who post videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep two times and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was surfing and it felt like the plane fell on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro have been panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said that due to the poor visibility , the jet flew lower than usual due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sted that security was at no time je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed .
this summer , area fires destroyed part of the Portuguese mainland , in which four people on Madeira Island came to death .
the Portuguese Air Force today stated that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which restric@@ ts his view .
the aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup out against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash goes up three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ w@@ inner@@ man has to give up with the under@@ stated cup@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europa League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament in Brazil .
in addition , Go@@ alie is missing Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen .
the German suffered a b@@ anding in the knee during the training , with which the initial issue at Bar@@ ca at least initially was clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years now .
coach Luis En@@ rique so far refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other applications res@@ ig@@ ns .
before the first mandatory play of the new season , the Spanish champion doubts about the fitness status of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
even at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ hi@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince them .
Sev@@ ille , in turn , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extending the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and aims to win the second victory at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far eleven successes Barcelona is the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in its own league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the World Cup first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at WM , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and even Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed it as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would catch the single title in the sign of the Five @-@ R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and time outs , they had no c@@ aches .
they had pulled back to the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ esters on their own in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I played the matches until now for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said fol@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game gold and silver med@@ alists were pos@@ ing with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly single @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
then he set the pace on the plate and let Z@@ hang down there only 13 points .
the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma did not develop the expected stirring match .
nevertheless , there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ set had drawn up a ri@@ pple injury , was then in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have , by the way , become a similarly high table tennis table Olympic runner .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &quot; enormous problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is afflicted by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative federal states losing its majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the current Republi@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race in his own Republi@@ can camp , the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians , asking for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilty were false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
repub@@ li@@ can strongh@@ olds whi@@ st@@ les
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Surv@@ ey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not with the gap that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview by the Sender CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t do anything else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if for him at the end for reasons of political correctness not rich , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said further .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump has threatened to withdraw funds to support its election campaign , it should not be able to present a better result .
instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans wanted to get stronger among the arms for Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Olympics : three &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sc@@ ams &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Dop@@ ing test &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary commission .
K@@ eni@@ as athletes face the second Dop@@ ing Aff@@ air at the Rio de Janeiro Un@@ ge@@ mach .
after an attempt at Dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee stated that we should urgently establish a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function had indicated that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ se .
this has been reported to the K@@ eni@@ as team leader by the dop@@ ing controllers .
the International Federation of IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigation , divided an IA@@ AF spokesperson .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; she said in an IA@@ AF .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ eni@@ as head de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red I had become World Cup fourth in Beijing in 2015 , more than 800 meters .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics President Michael Rot@@ ich was stri@@ pped off from the Rio games .
he is said to have informed about upcoming dop@@ ing tests against cash payments of his country .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , the IO@@ C has been under special surveillance for quite some time after numerous dop@@ ing contracts .
at the announcement of the more than 2,000 dop@@ ing target checks submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it has been noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted .
before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is consistent with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is a big runner @-@ nation .
athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alle@@ gations were repeatedly raised that in Kenya dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
in doing so , it could be proven that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically supp@@ ressed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then expelled from the summer games .
&quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Shakespeare &apos;s year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director of Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary a youth mare .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Symphony Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very l@@ atin amer@@ ican .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli is playing an older Maria .
she re@@ members with melanch@@ oly about her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
it is therefore clever , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics and they are just as meaningful today as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British ma@@ ids who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e lawyer said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that they were killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family told her to leave the torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is there - as warning and warning to others that this is the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from making this decision ever , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .

Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain in the case of electoral victory in Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Pres@@ i@@ dency candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor to the dec@@ eased Ju@@ dge at Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that Clinton is expected to &quot; choose Gar@@ land &quot; with a certain degree of certainty .
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clin@@ tons &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge of the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Republi@@ can blocked the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , be the lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants neck calendar for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring out a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distinguishes since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the opinion that it also does the calendar .
&quot; we need to return to the representation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the Cal@@ endar@@ s .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .

Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass flight
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds of Germany expect a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government had already over@@ taken Kurdish strongh@@ olds in the past few months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing from Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the s@@ worn put@@ sch still secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that assimil@@ ates refugees themselves produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
so Erdo@@ gan wants to boost the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or sold over the last hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the association called for the federal government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire @-@ marking as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ near foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
according to figures published by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks presented the largest group of asylum @-@ holders recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , there were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and , therefore , just under 29 per cent of all the identified entities ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey there is no question of war , poverty or lack of prospects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; going to where it hur@@ ts &quot;
wei@@ rd Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
as it hasn &apos;t been so until now , it &apos;s not possible : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day elections - that bites .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaign warri@@ ors , are on vacation .
most of the holi@@ day@@ makers travelling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the land day .
there are practical problems : during the holidays there are hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count votes at the end , only to rub vigor@@ ously .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to run its election campaign almost by itself .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust remains .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one can see from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ting a bit with the people as he did his legendary predecessor , Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise , sailors get cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel bl@@ ames the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes electoral campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale research ; Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ ro@@ ahl@@ kreis is located in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Sachsen than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U refra@@ ins largely from the usual electoral competition on market places and in front of shopping centres with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is , Kok@@ ert thinks , only plays a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that in the country you are un@@ le@@ ashing the base that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : barely there in the expan@@ ses of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering now has called on his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD had still won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the land day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the necessity of holiday and reloc@@ ate their election campaign largely to the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the country president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , green elec@@ tors embar@@ k on the search for local voters under the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ bs straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg @-@ Brandenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from closure
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and ending at about 8@@ pm there are praise .
&quot; they made it all pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the Jet petrol station .
this is a super team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site could be moved to the south as scheduled at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready .
the work is also commen@@ ded for the construction work , for example when it comes to setting up accommodation .
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
citizens can now exit from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic through the village seems to be going back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deputy Head of Deputy Director Florian King for the management of the rehabilitation project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ er@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage .
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fra@@ ying .
since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community also encouraged the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable sp@@ ills , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who informed himself about the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute have been inj@@ ected .
the quick@@ est was at 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometres in the Tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become cal@@ mer .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales revenues makes everyone who is asked to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the end customer are produced for other companies , for which the renovation has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the run@@ way is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily explo@@ ded are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be happy about every euro sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue deci@@ ph@@ ered to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road refurb@@ ishment has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to let the half of his staff be dismissed .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , District President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation . otherwise , the restaurant benefits from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much more generous has been handled .
for all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
finally , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are less frequent passing by because of the complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t go down , it &apos;s also nice somewhere else .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his pedi@@ gree is returning to the end of the renovation work .
in spite of the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on his customers for the greatest crisis he has experienced in their long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is constantly being scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Minister of Interior de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presents a thick security package .
but what has to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the ser@@ ge@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not demand anyone .
other further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in it .
however , as the Minister of the Interior , he was concerned with results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had to pass a bit of time before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
a lot is already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on air passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère launches a second attempt on proposals that had not yet to be made with the SPD : he wants to impose sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double nationality to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of this , he still considers it reasonable and also demands nothing , which doesn &apos;t have any chances in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them are in the process : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more opportunities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security audit .
in the case of divor@@ ces for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as com@@ mitting crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally tri@@ cky .
many things even seem un@@ disp@@ le@@ ased and leaves questions to be answered .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks by Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about safety .
and things that people pro@@ found@@ ly occupied could not be clas@@ h@@ ed even in election campaign times .
the inner security has greatly moved into focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elec@@ tive campaigns .
with the topic of internal security , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position .
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only a gar@@ ant@@ y dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the departments also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
from a departure from the double pass , he doesn &apos;t hold anything .
we have limited the discussion in Germany .
re@@ plen@@ ish it , do not make sense .
and with a bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , must still show itself .
there &apos;s a lot in it , which could cause controversy .
but the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen got off lightly .
in spite of diesel trade , the number of deliveries worldwide increases .
but not in all markets it runs round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of retri@@ eval , vor@@ tices are about a term . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen starts its deliveries in the second half of the year .
in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer can still boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , VW &apos;s core brand was weak@@ ening especially in Western Europe , and thus again bur@@ dened its sales as the company listed in the Da@@ x .
the VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
only in Western Europe , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
market sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought the weaker figures out of July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , there was a reluct@@ ance to buy a purchase in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also compla@@ ined about the exit from the EU , a spokes@@ woman explained .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas first escal@@ ates , another minus is also available .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the mainly affected family brand of the Lower Saxony already got off lightly thanks to the diesel andal : after the first seven months , only a distribution minus of 0.@@ 9 percent came to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales increase from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more cars at this time , with a total of 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software emission tests .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million vehicles to retro@@ fit into the workshop .
in the course of the conversion , VW confirmed that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects .
after the conversion of vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the change@@ over , the car manufacturer issued a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was in company circles on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for this is legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee of converted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my In@@ quiry Commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has taken over the guarantee that no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the change@@ over will not take place and all relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in company circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; enables customers to come into a workshop for example , for example , six months after the conversion - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in customer interest it is important to avoid that in case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the abor@@ tion sc@@ andal , there is no assurance of possible warranty regulations , as it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires wealthy depos@@ itors in future criminal interests - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , the Bank CEO Josef Paul said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks refers to an individual case and does not see in it a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay pen@@ alties for their as@@ par@@ ag@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks store money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 euros will cost 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time he covered 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief of the bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs now continue .
to leave the cash in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
most clients would have understanding and changed to other types of investment .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operative association Bayern declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry them alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically sustainable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 with a penalty interest of three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ban@@ ker said that on Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele that is more luxuri@@ ously furnished by wealth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she &apos;s free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently does not know any further banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spo@@ kes@@ person Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banken ( B@@ PR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
sol@@ itary middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before you rush to the comment section to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ ele &apos;s middle age with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement diver@@ ts from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no horror through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older shop@@ pers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but vote the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I wear a modest grey suit in the middle of a bu@@ stling street in Soh@@ o , before I stop , hold my hands and say something better than : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing them .
student from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle age , a woman , presumably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already appreciate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3000 or 4000 boards .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy objects he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records tend to be intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the you@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media , people who have heard about com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again .
from the conversations I have led , people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom on tra@@ ilers of the record company of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realise that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound plate sleeves , from objects that wake up happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s the same with many people .
it is an easy way to mentally deal with yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee flo@@ ps from a panel stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month had not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t own a record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while browsing through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) notices a &quot; trop@@ hi@@ es aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ oriented , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in only slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the vinyl records , has a lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ tary pop instead of experimental jazz re@@ conc@@ iles from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but na@@ iling psych@@ ic trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of the plates for sale .
it is more of a window @-@ shopping experience than a big shopping .
it does not earn much , therefore collecting disks is not a real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
as I give the impression to smu@@ ggle the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a crossover record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one who gives the most for luxury items such as records .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they are not considered , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they do not spend their th@@ ur@@ s@@ day tomorrow with security by che@@ ating through record stores on Ber@@ wick Street and sheets , while avoiding the star@@ ing look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator , who sha@@ kes nothing of the middle @-@ aged men &apos;s shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a hearing this week the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture notes that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would be a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups shared the court that the stores and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also assumed that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but acknowledged that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in the public and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of survivors in the J@@ ung@@ ell@@ ager had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers over the summer .
despite the disappointment of the Olympics : Martin remains fighting
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance in the Olympic period , Rad@@ profession@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to be accommod@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , keep confident and keep fighting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 31 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on Facebook before his departure from Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must calm@@ ly analyse the reasons for the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the reinforcement trailer
Germany &apos;s razor must adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , the Tem@@ plates will be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example at highway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary temporary polic@@ ing , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the reinforcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days with continuous measurement operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
all vehicles can also be tra@@ cked across multiple tracks simultaneously using laser measurement technology .
variable speed limits as well as transit b@@ ans according to time , driving distance and vehicle class can also be monitored .
according to the manufacturer , it is possible to move the trailer with a trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply st@@ owed away , it is lowered in the measurement operation , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear in the outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also being used .
also foreign authorities bl@@ itz with the new technology : recently , France ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 units last year .
great Britain takes silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening to an ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji gave a master class in handling , side @-@ stit@@ ching , back , line and raw power to gain gold - its first olymp@@ ic medal of any color .
the defeat was missed by the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - the UK &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day , could fall back in the final .
but irrespective of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least one Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former chief of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago they lost each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan .
here they lost only one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji commen@@ ced mira@@ cul@@ ously and allowed the attacks to boun@@ ce G@@ Bs from fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co. as if they were running in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ ze in the corner .
with only four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly gr@@ asp@@ ed the ball .
a sh@@ ack@@ le of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua turned a Touch@@ down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa has added a new one since the re @-@ start and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ breath@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ sured by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med down to the line to make a goal .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while G@@ GB was still learning .
this is how it is .
GB performed basic changes at half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ian gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ season until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt at GB , made a Touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Os@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ an , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ ung and danced on the platform .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged themselves and GB brut@@ ally ki@@ cked in the grass .
earlier on the day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the boys forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant later tac@@ kling Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the trainer &apos;s cancer for rowing
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than with these games and that wants to be called .
from the first strokes to the last , 220 tough p@@ ieve who enter the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning invented an additional significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympic old in the two @-@ se@@ ater without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sports that set such a standard .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , her 3@@ 9th in@@ gest@@ ed insert , which is also un@@ paralleled .
what we see are two brilliant female athlete , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of trigger to ge@@ ese .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to incre@@ mental progress that make the difference and no @-@ one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not , he spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty aw@@ ful situation .
it changes slightly the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if under such circumstances it is the right term .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and walked around the ward - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were enough .
this is how it starts .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory her first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve @-@ wra@@ cking morning doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears .
p@@ anning who was a Captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it just repe@@ ats how much I have worked on , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked on .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not lose any race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group &quot; water utility association , Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary in Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Frank@@ ish drinking water utility association as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago , it was in the original on a contribution made by the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Government di@@ gni@@ fied the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group applies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ wide as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years old in the ken@@ nel association , has 28 years as Managing Director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water utility of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the congregations are the municipalities of Kirch@@ heim , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
water supply contracts are available for other towns and municipalities .
the current President , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Con@@ federation in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events , it called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the elevated tank ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and I have always added new additions , because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her speech , Gö@@ ll@@ ers praised faithful , reliable and correct service over the past 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water utility association and he has lived the water utility association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he presented the successful concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group to reduce the rate of nit@@ rate before the Wasser@@ forum des Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
for this he received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised water@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ wart and he was a faithful boy .
together , we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he called the well @-@ construction and the re @-@ structuring of the association &apos;s association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the quar@@ ry in the high @-@ container at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high @-@ tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him I will be publicly prosec@@ uted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
if you see Sven S. , you should call 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
the police in Lü@@ beck initially refused to provide any information about the Ta@@ o and the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say any more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in the millions .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity production are from the table .
it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion in the existing facilities for the so @-@ called own electricity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister of Economy Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following discussions with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only if the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent will fall .
but this also does not rise in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
thus the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts have been particularly significant for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel is the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets must also be weighed in the reform of the emissions trading system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of products threw steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are making price dump@@ ing Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel have an effect , on the other hand economic prospects in China have risen .
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have been stagn@@ ating again .
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp had not wanted to exclude closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as Steel Division r@@ ushed on Friday .
after a brief increase in May , the quantity produced went back to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
due to an improved order situation , the association expects an increase in orders in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she finished the subject of music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
for S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Senior League .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describing h@@ ac@@ kl@@ ers .
regular gather@@ ings enable sen@@ iors to soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her chor@@ us : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize oneself , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
anyone who regularly requests his lungs will not get out of the pu@@ ff even in everyday life .
even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elderly people often have a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Association of Sen@@ iors @-@ Organ@@ iz@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the older generations the singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people aw@@ akes many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies , self @-@ dementia patients develop long @-@ distance events .
singing will also demand a special performance to the head , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly people who live alone do so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you experience through singing in the choir , &quot; H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I take long for something , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz advises L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ?
sen@@ iors have different options in search of the right offer , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings among the circle of friends in a senior choir , you can simply join them .
many cities also offer views of the Cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leader .
many sen@@ iors are also found on the internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours for help with the internet research .
anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the cra@@ cking of k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals has .
to her surprise , the mi@@ ch@@ ew did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved equally in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the level of reg@@ ression of cat @-@ boys at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great distress , as scientists have discovered by the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males also react to the rep@@ ut@@ ations of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; clearly , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ ch@@ iness of less and strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens for the males are either im@@ percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous investigation , the team of researchers has already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams differs with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female males were observed from the M@@ H@@ H livestock breeding .
they were played for a herd of little ones who were taken from the throwing box for three minutes and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens who were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the low sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who haven &apos;t had their own offspring , re@@ acted differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned to the speaker more quickly , when this ru@@ stle played the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noises .
some studies also showed that women responded more sensi@@ tively to infants , no matter whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski interven@@ es with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ mezzanine is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ k .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey an important football match is taking place again .
before the Du@@ el of the arch@@ rival of Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul for the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even at the suspension of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government regre@@ t@@ ted that the daily life of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt .
at the same time , football is not stopped .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ me@@ k .
accordingly , the southern cant@@ een living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ mezzanine is to be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is being held responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency which is suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact most Turks have no impact on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be finished on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the &quot; Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; club are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
but what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in the history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will particularly arrive on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his crew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the round @-@ kno@@ ck in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say good @-@ bye to the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g , it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and this is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year of the game was better .
above all , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ schutz@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig laid the foundation for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
at the same time , the agreement with the AC Florence under contract and on Bes@@ ik@@ tas had revealed only om@@ itted Gom@@ ez after the coup attempt to not return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but to do so , the storm would have to be ready to renoun@@ ce around one @-@ third of its € 7.5 million year @-@ round sal@@ aries , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; we cannot pay its salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin has been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova must not start in Rio .
other survivors of Ath@@ le@@ tics can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ wel@@ m@@ owa , who had lam@@ ented their starting right shortly before the games after a Dop@@ ing barrier , was ki@@ cked out mer@@ cil@@ essly at their start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ cil@@ essly .
it was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal setting : with a super@@ se@@ ded smile she was still in the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was clear that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a jam storm .
but there are still many other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the Dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here &apos;s an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he had been locked two times for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion goes even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit in 2010 a six @-@ month lock@@ out after taking the medication Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion from 2012 , world champion from 2013 and European championships was tested positive on the banned stimul@@ ant medium meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the sent@@ encing and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great Gold favor@@ ites .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and had been blocked 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , stun@@ ned mar@@ ching .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Bel@@ or@@ ussi@@ a ) : hardly any athlete had so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having established testosterone Dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to hand over Olympic silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and EM @-@ title because of testosterone abuse .
the 2008 Olympic Games , also recognised as a bronze medal , returned to CA@@ S due to a verdict of the International Sports Tribunal .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championships , references to taking a banned dietary supplement have been found , the barrier of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and ran off on July 13 .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Foreign Affairs Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she has suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again .
she planned her home travel for the beginning of September .
whether the other explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also affected by Austrian citizens , are still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so cuts .
at about 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a geh@@ ammer .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another human being killed , according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was reported also from Ph@@ u@@ ket .
the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach resort Pat@@ ong , popular with tourists , was injured by a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explosive charge went into the air in a flower be@@ et in front of the territory of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south@@ western coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast called for several wounded .
one goes out of a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves about possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
the authorities have received secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they were not informed of the exact date and places .
it is still unclear which group lies behind the proposals .
the police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are still smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the case @-@ hungry bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need for travelling to these provinces .
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
the jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moved towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , benefits itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for many years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in a popular Hind@@ u Shr@@ ine in Bangkok , most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been put into sight by the Federal Office for Constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several state offices , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists in the Federation have also set the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; evidence of the free democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ eder of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic beliefs or from the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now observing the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; mul@@ ticul@@ tural ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot;
constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already .
Ma@@ eva said his authority was closely aligned with the state offices in the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group where it is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts generally try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as the extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to this .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there have been reports from several German states about contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ da said he had no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - will change its direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase in illegal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee @-@ shel@@ ters , Ma@@ dine said he would not yet speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism .
but we have stated in recent years that it can give right @-@ wing structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups that plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable .
the previous groups emerged on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he expressed concern over the fact that many attacks came to the account of people who had not appeared in the right @-@ wing scene beforehand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying concern .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum accommodations were not previously known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that had previously nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or who voted for example the CD@@ U , the SPD or the Left , who , however , have radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sen@@ timent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or world records do not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghted swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia was so slow that it temporarily was no longer visible in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year old finished with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 year old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
as most sports@@ men run in a@@ edi@@ cs , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ro Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the rounds fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity belly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ metre Fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ant from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea when he had to race alone in a run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old then learned to swim eight months before the Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

tr@@ ump is not so close to the im@@ pending electoral defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks to a campaign event in Florida .
if there &apos;s nothing wrong with the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .
he then goes on vacation .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , that doesn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately , it will either work , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station , CN@@ BC .
if for him at the end for reasons of political correctness not rich , that is al@@ right , said Tr@@ ump .
he described the US president Barack Obama and the nomin@@ ee of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party , more and more resistance was formed .
mail climbs into the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
the Group will shortly start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the postal service wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters in the coming year also on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they want to sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter with which letters and par@@ c@@ els are to be sold to other companies .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ den said , there are always re @-@ asking , for example by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bonn Group plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ d announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we are converting the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP management follows dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the worldwide number five of the industry faces a new beginning .
the company will leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert is already leaving the supervisory body with effect from September 12 .
as early as 1 September , the leadership in the Executive Board deleg@@ ated the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ jer@@ inger , who shared the company .
he is supposed to officially take over the function of a &quot; Chief Executive Officer , &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
it is still unclear who will lead the market research company in the future .
in investor circles it was said on Friday , at the shareholders the disappointment of the continuing success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago was great .
Mr Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen even after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the most recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that were the case at BMW , that would make the qu@@ and@@ ts like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have the ability to stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the comparable prior @-@ year quarter .
in the first half of the year , sales fell by 3.4 percent to € 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
earnings in the second quarter mainly imp@@ acted the company &apos;s dr@@ unk@@ enness in view of its difficult economic situation .
the corporate value depreci@@ ation of 139 million euros , which was made in the Consumer Experience business unit , amounted to a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
the Gf@@ K generated a consolidated net profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ir@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
in an accident of a touring coach with 43 elderly passengers as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ir@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , shared the police with them .
according to him , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade her testimony to an opposite truck , which was partly on the opposite track .
the bus arrived to the right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade delivered the passengers .
six rescue cars and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the scene of the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ horns district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter waste water amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ u@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a heavy calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the household by the District Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was found that under@@ lay for these sewage plants .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost @-@ effectively .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ u@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Head of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt presented the panel , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the previous calculation period will also be compensated .
Schmidt explained the fact that all three sewage plants are relatively small , with a very low waste water attack , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year .
as a result of the low distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing .
as a result of the age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , all three installations will continue to have a considerable scope , not least due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair .
the complex in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ u@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced by a damage in the wastewater plant in Az@@ endorf .
after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants , expenses for operation and maintenance were &quot; full . &quot;
in the process , Schmidt , the market town of large entertainment costs , has remained spar@@ ed for the past 20 years .
according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al sewage system could not be extended by these facilities because there are defic@@ its .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critici@@ zed as Asian cartoon
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to race .
with its filter tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all faults arrive to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have raised criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting the App Black@@ face promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week several users hit a filter , who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and abandoned che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; ja@@ un@@ dice . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism , the filter reminded of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos was widespread , wrote that the filter was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and gentle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face was drawn into the degra@@ ding extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling bank .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult for such things to remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu , for the big part , critici@@ zed only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they do not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has left Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel manager focusing on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu also said she was closed to her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS Intelligence information , notes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground were allowed , an inquiry committee of the congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Central Command Intelligence Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence reports , typically associated with high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground have allowed and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports , it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mozambique would start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , member of the Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command tops changed the intelligence reports to reduce the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigation continues .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are being conducted by the Secretary General of the Department of Defense .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a moder@@ ately restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the Committee , Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mor@@ als referred to analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House in the Cent@@ Com analysts as to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported cases of investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , who were admitted to complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the General In@@ spec@@ tor &apos;s investigations were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of disputes of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward only to a small occupation force in Iraq and little time preten@@ ding to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against current reporting on the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker states that contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ n@@ ally commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his exc@@ essively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the US winning match in the women &apos;s field @-@ hockey , a show@@ down with the UK is ahead
one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever done that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind .
however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten .
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed one will take a little longer from the strong Dutch , which will lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the American women have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time in three years she had a hockey s@@ layer in her hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things into a better one .
&quot; a change of culture , mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said .
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we have now .
we &apos;ve got the ru@@ dder all around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door @-@ row in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash of the close range .
India went into the game without a win , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and then loaded the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the tournament for the US go@@ al@@ keeper Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who so far had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;re in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is also , it &apos;s the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ escap@@ able , a fur@@ ious relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is passed from the Cross@@ bow to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the gym@@ n@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue in the queue without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been under these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , based on sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic jumping competition .
the Olympic flame did not highlight every event .
further from the center , some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swim and may it reign for a long time .
but if I have a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline was an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se the last 16 years that many of those I had questioned did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n school than the one for the Olympics .
at this point I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but an enthusi@@ ast enthusi@@ ast .
it has a humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending impact - but also the gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the span@@ ish El Tramp@@ oline , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , fen@@ cing and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic programme , they are rated according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio against each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alists must carry on in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further highlight in the TV broadcast : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ist .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I find myself ti@@ res@@ ome when looking at these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
the qualifying and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming around 13 : 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will em@@ it the end @-@ rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the middle of the Olympic man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the ang@@ ul@@ ing and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner suggests recently according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is waiting for his air @-@ bark , new fan community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one generation protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia are pushing for violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with police at gun@@ shots .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
in the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into ever more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ruth@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation movies about the protests that are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , how security people hit young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a detailed investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or imprisoned , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use up to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
following a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , tensions continue to rise along the Er@@ it@@ rea border ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line prompted hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liber@@ al Front or the O@@ ga@@ den National Liberation Front , which have been forced more or less in recent years , will exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of exposure to the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate through the social media because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the Internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate about Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians have stated that they were assembled in such a way as protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and business , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is illeg@@ ally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , had been Prime Minister until his death in a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 for 17 years .
he was considered a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in seeing early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special agents to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia was experiencing such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 , after thousands of prot@@ esters prot@@ ested , apparently fu@@ elled by the government and then stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in recent months and this time of tur@@ mo@@ il went relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in comb@@ ating poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month prot@@ esters attacked Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , headed by Tig@@ ray and the hatred against the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests surrounding the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse into an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his statement Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by fear@@ ing that his repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ si@@ bly with the American public .
it also brings together his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant .
after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump with@@ drew in terms of the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was the contrast to the previous day , where Mr Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was totally serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism r@@ ashes on Mr. Tr@@ ump as he attempts to direct the focus of his campaign for falling survey values to the economic situation .
Mr Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found his speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
at the end of July he had a strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but he explained later , &quot; Of course , I thought that sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction drops out . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone as his survey values have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr Tr@@ ump is generally trying to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his humour .
but as he continues to focus attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal collabor@@ ators into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent inter@@ viewers , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
it is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it ho@@ cks , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by allowing them to asser@@ t the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around and being bi@@ ased at each of his words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s excuse as only a further proof that he was un@@ fit for the Pres@@ idential Administration .
once Up@@ on the Price of the Market , Café is coming back to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were ou@@ sted .
soap Cher@@ ie , sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people claimed it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ ular wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is exemp@@ t and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also re@@ discovery .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a client offered him to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ishes like cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural swe@@ eps .
the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
after the calf had closed , she gave up the coffee @-@ r@@ ink for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized it was the cup of coffee and the culture I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to a quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment for the soap business to take the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for spo@@ iling with cold bre@@ wed coffee in the coffee shop as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will respond to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he decided to issue her soon so that his new neighbors would feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a delic@@ acy , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble for sophisticated delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land ter@@ rap@@ in soup .
its menu on that day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Hell@@ man .
her husband , Andrew Co@@ e , added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans how to eat them . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es &apos;s latest book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; talks about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small local snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
Bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture .
when the re@@ porter ordered wood roast , this found the couple suitable for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traces the ways the country was dealing with , not to be the land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se was the new budget : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit .
meat , which was the focal point of American cuisine for many years , became a rarely servi@@ ced luxury .
peculiar blends have been tried out as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen common sense .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick prepared a dish from that epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no popular addition at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continued : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions do not match each other .
it was typical for many of the house recipes .
as never before or since , budget@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - denoun@@ ced the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing prescri@@ ptions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politics &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies .
particularly tasty are the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ cake @-@ eating posture .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen of his kitchen , he fed as the million @-@ million man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was glori@@ ously realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to post@@ p@@ one an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was disc@@ arded as soon as the country came back on its legs .
the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , says Ziegel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the flow of the wind .
after having cleared the plates at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they dra@@ gged out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Roos@@ ev@@ elt did eat at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a nasty trick to miss a modest name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody appeared a bit reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown gli@@ b@@ bers .
amaz@@ ingly , it didn &apos;t taste bad .
Co@@ E took a break three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some hack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he started his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died on the Assad regime &apos;s barrel bomb attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a group of civilians who so far saved almost 60@@ ,000 lives according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life into play to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Guard , which shows him about the ruins of a house during an 11 hour rescue from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol of symbol@@ ism in the horror of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes he never saw himself , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;

rare sight .
Greenland sh@@ arks usually only come to the surface in winter .
after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea on board the S@@ anna research ship .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ sh@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years of age .
lei@@ surely , the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches just 1.@@ 220 metres in average .
only when it comes to it acceler@@ ates the five @-@ meter @-@ long animal up to a full 2.@@ 6@@ km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
however , this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness seems to be a pat@@ ron@@ age for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case by a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist believed that Greenland ha@@ i@@ ries are becoming more of a stone age .
only the evidence was lacking .
Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
their slow motion measured them when they star@@ ed six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , this sh@@ arks make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the polar sea and seek cad@@ a@@ vers that tor@@ ment from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland ha@@ i@@ ries that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the greatest 50@@ 2 cm measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the l@@ enti@@ cular core of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens is already created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins in it will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably many carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ cular core .
therefore , after the early 1960s , their birth was to lie in the atmosphere when nuclear weapons resor@@ ted to large amounts of this radioactive carbon .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ res in length , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all larger Greenland ha@@ i@@ ries had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the increase obviously leave for at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such Meth@@ us@@ el@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
also the record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland w@@ al , in whose bacon on the neck had a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs into flame @-@ flames .
they later mature later - and age more slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible early as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very big animal should , on the other hand , invest his resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
in the latest session , the Council has focused on topics relating to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel accepted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently proven housing surfaces can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the property , plot and settlement issues were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying were clari@@ fied , the sale of land plots in the residential areas &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the oc@@ cl@@ usal surfaces in the rural and quiet residential community Schö@@ nau attract young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , the volunteers can now report to the Town Hall as soon as possible , about the allocation of the plots the municipal council is expected to consult in its September session .
in order to be able to meet requests for the reloc@@ ation of other businesses , in conjunction with job creation , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan , which was newly created in the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area designated there is extended by two par@@ c@@ els towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
consequently , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether financial institutions should continue to operate in London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , it has so far been granted approval in the UK .
they are currently using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calcul@@ ates with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities , such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority , E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Committee ES@@ R@@ B .
although the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered in Paris , it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while Luxembourg inv@@ ades a large fund business , its infrastructure deterior@@ ates badly , just like Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
in addition , the city is equipped with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial properties is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition due to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in number 19 , Dublin in number 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although quality of life is a question of preference , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With its already strong position as a financial hub for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my business researchers .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , were 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. National Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the legal expenses that you emerged from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after an American judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , U.S. Director Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to match Gilead with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck acc@@ use each other and claim ownership of laboratory work , to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir bot@@ ell@@ ag , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the US have rec@@ ap@@ tured the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left the city , a spokes@@ man of the group said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently ham@@ str@@ ing the city after the expul@@ sion of the remaining group of comb@@ at@@ ants who have buried themselves within the city .
they delivered more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council approved by the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying out cleaning operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton earned 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton published their tax return for 2015 on Friday , which resulted in the US presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s Clinton donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton posted USD 3 million in Rede@@ mption Cem@@ etery , an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ presi@@ dency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax statements for the last ten years with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false statements and re@@ perc@@ ussions with regards to his previous promises to publish his tax statements .
it is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations even though they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter regarding the publication of the Democrats &quot; presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump &apos;s special advis@@ er , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax checks were not completed .
dump@@ s critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the subject and posted a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump invites to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke to the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and publish his tax statements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that during the 1990s Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little tax , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax attor@@ neys and tax consultants on Friday , indicating that this could still be the case .
in the election campaign , federal taxes have become an issue .
Clinton is supporting a regime named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return as far back as 2007 .
on average , the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of app@@ r . 40@@ ,5 % .
the tax return of the 2015 Clin@@ tons showed that they only paid $ 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders , fire@@ work bodies promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea years ago , intensified its promotion together with the US nature conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
before , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the telephone number dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without doing harm to the eleph@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ li@@ ly cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders mixed with soil is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition switch .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts up with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust at ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders into the air .
a touch quite usually already aus to ch@@ ase the elephant .
one last option is a laun@@ cher who shoots a fire bri@@ gade in the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .

Jewish director cr@@ ushes Berlin hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed by &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli pres@@ election as Arab guests were requested &quot; according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s country code list .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a way to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ch@@ oked him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a quite large resonance on the Internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of them signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that they had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indul@@ ged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in another article stating that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is next to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added .
police op@@ poses tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , causing the police to enter rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the participants of the protest saw Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts spra@@ ying against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent year @-@ on @-@ year .
since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , the interest on Russian enterprises on businesses grew strongly in the country , sharing the ambass@@ adors with them .
Russian companies adopt existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further expansion of trade is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 amounted to 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports into Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade offensive was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan embark@@ s on a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign representation represented around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , first of all travel visa , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia were broken from last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only a few Russians attend Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses sought : beverage market falling into Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y was carried out on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the staff of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
the police do not share the amount of money that has been exploited .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters in size , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the assault , the perpetr@@ ators have to run towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and have escaped from the gravel car park located opposite the parking garage with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly towards B 256 ( ring n@@ ring ) .
who made observations at the time of the crime ( at 19.@@ 45 o &apos;clock ) which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y attack should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer holidays
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social education day group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection federation Nag@@ old with their care@@ gi@@ vers on their summer holidays in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
during the first week of school , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered in the quiet leisure village of Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ len .
several day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , we went to save with the visit of the stro@@ ma zoo .
on the other side of Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the deep @-@ sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and planning .
culinary delights were given to children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ made body@@ courses such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ger Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops it was cur@@ ated to create beautiful jewels of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot;
on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the Do@@ ors of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna travelled to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were tac@@ kled .
in order to bridge the period up to the next Roma trip of all the minor stran@@ ts in the next two years , the senior round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the decision was finally decided for the Bishop &apos;s City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at Frei@@ burger Münster .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ene , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt went on their way .
in the evening before Pastor Stor@@ ey sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage crosses and told the Pil@@ gri@@ ms .
from Hor@@ b , by train , we drove to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Hungarian dar@@ ling woman stood and so the pilgri@@ m &apos;s way from Münster was res@@ ig@@ ned .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short impulse with various prayers , songs and text texts .
but also on the way , the min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made a stop to sing a song of specially assembled Pil@@ gri@@ ms song .
the parish halls of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and tonic dinner and breakfast at the stage targets .
it continued on the second day on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after that , the trip to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , had to be lowered at first around 500 metres altitude and then climbed again .
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the lake in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the min@@ is arrived at Frei@@ burger Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was thank@@ ful here .
Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home when Br@@ ite won gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int at the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year old from Glasgow took up the anchor that his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . he took the legend hau@@ ghty when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the F@@ av@@ our@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London at the London Track World Championships in March .
the problem between Beijing and London was the sub@@ stitution of Jamie staff .
they did so in time as Hin@@ dering .
his retirement produced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ ds , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner put in the qualification rounds an Olympic squ@@ ad , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British Trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap he fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation coming into a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ds when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord in the final round and defeated world champi@@ ons .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 on the Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys side , there was a hint that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection from England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB of flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have joined together as a team during the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who is exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a seemingly sacred date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is next to the spr@@ int , which starts today and will go for more than three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Brown W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified for the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had fought with agents before the qualification yesterday when function@@ aries were calling him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie entered the world record time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to win a tro@@ op of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were down@@ tro@@ dden .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , such as Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s res@@ ignation in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and m@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which at the perfect moment reached its climax , could be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract , thereby raising all supply contracts , as the energy company supplying .
this step followed by the government &apos;s decision at Victoria beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a 20 @-@ year subsi@@ dy will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the Al@@ coa factory in Port@@ land are at stake .
no fewer than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could lead to dom@@ ino effects as the melting plant uses around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the enam@@ el of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land lo@@ oses money and risks closure .
this step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , informed that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L still stated that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is why AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on the earnings of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already depreci@@ ated the value of the contracts in its annual subscription in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the sm@@ el@@ ting factory or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang that would have entered into force from November this year , even though it is still a declaration of why it res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
referring to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity annually .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand in the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generator , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ? ) , sp@@ ook@@ y reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the all @-@ popular show bi@@ z un@@ cles and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) .
that puts the c@@ lich@@ é plot almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rem@@ nant brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we &apos;ve forgotten you ? &quot; ) , with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris has had to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her to have beaten the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Acc@@ ording to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista &apos;s 8@@ 32 pages of advertising ) .
the disclosure of his cover @-@ star is eag@@ erly awaited , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine even before the official announcement perme@@ ated .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence had been on the cover for 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true for Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enny &apos;s success does not like everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enni@@ fer &apos;s position in the world of fashion has always been ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; The Mist@@ resses of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but looking at the mis@@ chief seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters will sell images of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal authorities have 16@@ 0.000 people every year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s relief needs are dismissed annually by the municipal authorities , while the industry faces the impact of further central cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five persons - mostly elderly , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those with no means for un@@ just dele@@ tions and the like - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ hau@@ led , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal resources .
the director of the meeting centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Municip@@ alities Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people were already rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the resolution of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are under@@ funded , which means thousands of people from important services you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people in need will be forced out of Que@@ ens@@ land to cope with their legal problems without any assistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Justice as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately abol@@ ish these mid @-@ cuts , so that people can receive the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to national average . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their customers and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Ele@@ ction Campa@@ ign accused after employee allegedly with@@ drawing weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after it has been reported that its campaign manager for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on a staff in February while they were on the road in February in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in a bill filed in the Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i claimed to have been waiting for months for the matter to be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and took the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i found that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he announced in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons don &apos;t have to be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indi@@ ct@@ ment came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - Sh@@ un@@ gun owners and weapons friends - should take action if its rival was elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judge .
the campaign clearly indicated that the media had torn its words out of context and that it would not inc@@ ite violence .
ordin@@ is Compla@@ int demands compensation from the campaign for violation of due di@@ ligence and Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage .
dump@@ s press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip also failed .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has so far conducted a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries Ele@@ ctions : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) there are significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U governing parties .
this resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the Bild @-@ Zeitung ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rule in the North , this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin .
but in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to position the head of the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD top@@ pled from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iles just before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is cont@@ ested between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previous 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
despite a slight loss of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Green Party returned to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 percent each .
according to the survey , according to the pol@@ l of the poll@@ s , the SPD used only 23 percent of the survey ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pirates would not miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good either .
on the contrary , it was rather ch@@ unk@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , that would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros , fans can still buy the devices on the internet , but they originate somehow from the Stone Age of the internet age .
but 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could provide a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible per HTML browser , albeit tor@@ menting .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was pretty proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s &apos; mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
today the market is dominated by providers who came all a lot later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere , this is everyday life for a lot of people .
there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2015 .
about 1.4 billion devices sold , Samsung and Apple were accounted for by 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales of equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
a whole industry has now emerged around the smartphone .
the crucial breakthrough in the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac World announced the introduction of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , all by touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al procession began , even today , the iPhone is the Group &apos;s most important product .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the after@@ glow .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ Ber@@ ry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to get the Smartphone away again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel on the Siemens Board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to He@@ ath@@ row .
we will have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips for our local communities alone , creating 40,000 new jobs and bringing youth unemployment to an end in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I have been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be flo@@ cking on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in economic growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the world &apos;s two most frequ@@ ented run@@ ways .
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is backed by £ 16 billion in private investments .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , the software manufacturer tries to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its des@@ k@@ top@@ side would change coding with regard to its advertisements to make it difficult to detect advertisements about which part of the advertising page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams commented that &quot; this sort of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the time @-@ t@@ ant@@ alizing open source community and the circum@@ ference is already underway since the invention of scor@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how alar@@ ming display blo@@ wers have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a recent study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide use ad block@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users accessing Facebook on their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes up 84 percent of the advertising revenues of Facebook .
the company has put it apart from advertising blocks on desktop PCs , as mobile advertising blocks have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues , so Facebook is seeing the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would be updating its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ferences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tool to give people more control over it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook maintained that new filters would be wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokesperson in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , so we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to control people &apos;s hands .
woman having presum@@ ed suicide on the Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are calling for witnesses , after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday in a supposed suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was convic@@ ted of several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , calling on them as well as any witness to the incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , distributed G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having passed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne a night in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious on the street , taking the court .
the court found that the police -- responding to a call -- drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report at the police number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably hab@@ itable once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine if Venus could have re@@ fut@@ ed Earth @-@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and carbon dioxide atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from quick evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a Sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its daylight exposure for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , creating a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface of much of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , similar to evolution that was previously thought by planet explor@@ ers .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans were evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy steps back as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy returned on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado River A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been the best coach of the league during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he introduced the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed out in each of the last two years of the low season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell back five points behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ eper Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two songs with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers again resume talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour disputes relating to wages for North Sea workers are suspended , while all the con@@ ten@@ ders sit on the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the Wood Group oil @-@ field service provider were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution of the current dispute , &quot; is said in a joint statement .
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , starting next year to address the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s rating is below a 10 percent reduction for on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company provide the required space in order to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ al@@ ises its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ accounts with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion of spending on new projects in the North Sea will be expected to be around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades star cluster .
the new data help astronom@@ ers to understand why stars rotate in con@@ stellation @-@ pile to different rates as well as in what connection the rot@@ ational periods with planet emergence are .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star@@ lings , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ations , these mature stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star stain , such as sun@@ spots .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars are rotating more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars rotating slower tracks than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the cluster of stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the cluster of stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
there is a lot ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , when and why stars are slow@@ ing down their rot@@ ations and so to speak , their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues in three newspaper reports have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez &apos;s tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional response , the 41 year old pro will be wearing the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , winning the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es in 2009 .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has given him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as consultant and youth coach - with a full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid it back for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 winners for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he has achieved some mil@@ estones .
with Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players share similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be included in the fame @-@ hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star was admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was banned from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was arrested for 2@@ 11 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered a major suspect to have received high @-@ performance funds for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I &apos;ve played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell days are not silent as well .
while many bas@@ eball legends win the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the situation with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got sympathy with the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e ore rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the fans sang at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio because of a positive dop@@ ing test .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
an inqu@@ iring athlete would have won almost one medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases were announced by the Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre barrier @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions these news come to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de was detected last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year old took fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butter@@ flies , just 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the courses of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport Court ( CA@@ S ) and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio the news sp@@ oo@@ ked on the positive test with Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive by himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , EP@@ O &apos;s blood dop@@ ing agent should act as a prohibited substance .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B specimen should have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to the bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation are not allowed to take part in Rio .
on Friday the case called &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both deny the intake , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , the Dan@@ ek@@ owa @-@ case is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the International Federation of IA@@ AF had banned the whole Russian team up to an exception due to systematic dop@@ ing , also the country of runners Ken@@ yan produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in swimming sport , the earlier violations in China were also taken care of by the athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the Podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a discussion with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun had been tested positive for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine in 2014 , but only had to sit for a three @-@ month lock@@ out .
data lau : as per@@ fi@@ de re@@ presses h@@ acker their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting specific companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey by the malware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past 12 months have at least once , some times more victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the fees required by the perpetr@@ ators to re @-@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential for ex@@ tor@@ ting ran@@ som is much higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently watch a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were designed to send ads .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
after all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying quickly over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , she searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as after archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als last@@ ingly .
the software then presents the test@@ ers &apos; demands .
to get the final key code to the files , the victims must pay money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin - .
but where private users have the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware is added .
22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always tell the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in view of stagn@@ ation .
the hack@@ ers , in turn , know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually attempt to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their cas@@ u@@ alties by chat@@ ting how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files .
and if private individuals are rede@@ emed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must negotiate a part hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of potentially high and relatively high @-@ risk profits from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , Security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual test@@ ers .
the malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail then searches for additional hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so one logs in one of the Forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals then commission sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement , the perpetr@@ ators will instead threaten the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also set out entirely new goals on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz defect , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be really flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the upper side of the cockpit is falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with up@@ lifted and 10@@ 26 l with back@@ rest back@@ rests , but there are the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chairs and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor up to a ceiling .
the luggage compartment is well loaded , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering should be a little more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency brake assist ( operates at speeds 32 ) , the collision warning system and lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote @-@ light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent template re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if required .
but full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI @-@ jack lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are all right .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
Air@@ line is not responsible for : down@@ fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline cannot be held responsible for over@@ throwing a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only in the case of hazards that are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
but the accident could have happened all over - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay compensation for the man .
case : when the Organ@@ izer paid
after their journey , sick holi@@ day@@ makers will only get money if the cause of the disease is without doubt in the hotel .
however , this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
in the trial , a family was seriously ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ way .
she spent nearly the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought back the tourists to a faulty treatment plant , which supposedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was lacking - and compla@@ ined against the organizer .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the wastewater treatment plant was in fact defective .
but the promot@@ er only learned about it shortly before the departure of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
he thus did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
since in the samples of the water there were no im@@ puri@@ ties found .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly caused by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belong to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said after the atro@@ cities committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were afraid of further attacks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must be sensible and determined at the same time to react to terrorist threats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we won &apos;t treat this triumph to the terrorists .
if the perpetr@@ ators would have to leave the country more quickly , this increases safety and strength also with the approval of the population for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal reinforcement of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ four @-@ digit size over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism should be punished again .
video surveillance is to be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire is am@@ ended in such a way that , above all , the purchase of weapons on the internet is ham@@ pered .
the most recently discussed confidentiality of confidentiality for doctors should be maintained according to the Ma@@ izi@@ ère words .
however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the danger of the citizens can be reduced , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the minister sees better social assistance necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly expressed himself against shareholders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
under constitutional law , a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is problemati@@ cal .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
Simon &apos;s green boss , Sim@@ one Peter , accused the minister of simul@@ ating action and action with new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway feeder
it st@@ umps on the circum@@ navigation on a regular basis - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should change : the legal remedy shall be prolonged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all car drivers who are standing in traffic on the ambient road every night in traffic when they drive over the highway A@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 @-@ 17 August ) , the road construction company extended the right @-@ hand side road by 700 metres on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 @-@ 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the exit Wes@@ eler road .
drivers can then navigate directly from the Hammer Straße to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is getting up early , thus improving the overall production sequence on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the re@@ sta@@ u goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic is only chann@@ eled into one lane over the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge would no longer have the necessary load force in order to absorb the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated work@@ day traffic will continue , the competent national company cannot say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years ago , because the bridge has an official remaining duration up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal defle@@ ction resort , the state company deliberately chose the bu@@ si@@ est time during the school holidays because it is to be expected with disabilities .
on Tuesday and Wednesday , traffic passes one lane on the building site .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the theater piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge theater are now planning a musical project .
N@@ ima &apos;s society enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the society N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the Small House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster under this project .
most of the youngsters of the class had come from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , among others , from September 2015 to March 2016 and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Young theatre Münster .
the club N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from tongues , and the young theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
between October and December , young people with and without a migration background and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
special offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical dis@@ sem@@ ination are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement
the weather made the shooting of the shooting stars in the south @-@ west Germany on the night a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the star @-@ scales are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us that rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around forever , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep well before the wake @-@ up ring@@ ing .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleeping disorders and more than ten percent perceive their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Medicine and S@@ leep Medicine .
what we see for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , an inhal@@ ation and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
just passing through sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of directors in the German house medical association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there are organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors behind it , but also drugs .
in@@ frequently sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common especially with depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Clark . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors determine each other .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , every two or three hours will wake up and possibly start to worry about everyday problems and worries .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is com@@ promised the day should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eks .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as ga@@ stri@@ c or headache .
to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include , among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
dor@@ man@@ t medical professionals hardly exist in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
this is why you should first contact the family doctor if you have trouble sleeping .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what will happen ?
for example , in the case of snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , for example , in the case of snor@@ ing , in case of sickness , in@@ som@@ nia or if one does not find the cause of a lack of sleep , Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ apping , one goes to bed at the normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera draws the sleeping ends on the ceiling .
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can set for better sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regular dormit@@ ory and stand @-@ up times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleeping , avoid alcohol and do not watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler commented on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he took gold at the Sh@@ ort@@ wave World Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
the former DS@@ V athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has now protected himself from his ex @-@ team@@ mates who stood in the criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic med@@ alist gets 20,000 € bonus and a junk car 150@@ ,000 € no one should wonder about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page during the night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in swimming is bad , but dop@@ ing controls are very good .
with this we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look at the subject of dop@@ ing as closely or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ zer would have to be registered nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly the way it should be done with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers from the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election burger who has now operated a ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of baggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
the police of the Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had made several bags of bags and bags of luggage .
at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the area of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf insp@@ ected a gang known to polic@@ emen from past theft off@@ enses .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July . they had worked very professionally and professionally .
the specialists of the crime com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves submitted especially to commit criminal off@@ ences .
in total , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like that at first sight , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a beer shop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in front of a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already being built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new lease apartments will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is , however , preferred in recent weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have le@@ ases , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , particularly the Berlin Interior sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard way of police action against the project , the area referred to as the &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ett s@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers were cleared , the police pat@@ ro@@ led three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown home owners , the construction workers were renov@@ ating the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers mar@@ ched under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late i .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and nursery schools .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wished for majority of the police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin sen@@ ator and the police establish between the house occup@@ ants and their neighbours , does not exist so clearly .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main Street very close to the Riga landscape .
while the Main@@ zer had been ev@@ acu@@ ated under a large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects in the Riga region were leg@@ alized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ing liners from all over the world : residents from GDR times and former home occup@@ iers also share their neighborhood .
this is reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Riga region are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be recognized by disc@@ arded slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown using colored bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road has been mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : criminal offen@@ ders such as body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences do property damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rental house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
in terms of violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they were certainly not .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architect her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and has stayed .
that is why it was so important for her to get back to the street : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the part of the city .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by si@@ ght@@ less new@@ buildings in former bau@@ bles , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well @-@ equipped are living here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot;
but what can you do if someone never li@@ stens to someone ?
fru@@ stration arises on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of bred dogs , who are anno@@ yed by colour @-@ bom@@ b@@ ings : the house projects and the left @-@ wing were part of the Kie@@ z .
those who come from should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area who can complain about noise there .
all persons presented only with first names have asked to not be named with their proper name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee representative for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugees , administration , authorities and anyone else involved .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there now , the cutting @-@ edge wo@@ ollen mus@@ k , which is above all a problem .
some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ing but rather targeted on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a cutting @-@ edge wo@@ ollen car@@ p .
but administrative work is not her central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le means .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine Customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connection of the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises .
the costs of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the Land@@ rats@@ amt is responsible for the municipality and job centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto , the administration does not find any private apartments .
until now , it does not work , so that one relies on private apartments such that Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but it is not only with apartments .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school places , one @-@ euro jobs and job opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not just mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people should develop a sense of belonging .
so it needs offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here also administration and volunteers are jumping .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses .
who at some point develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customer honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who don &apos;t care at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization after recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some people may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins were completely re@@ voc@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look for activities on site and in the region .
they are always in the background that a new pile of refugees and migrants will soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid .
in fact , it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine client also makes it clear that the documents are already utilized to properly integrate the previous people .
currently , these are about 100 people , mainly young men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
