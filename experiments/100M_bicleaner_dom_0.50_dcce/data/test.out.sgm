<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little change with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>

<seg id="11">He had to run with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even hover for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>

<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trump Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. Presidential candidates are at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical basis.</seg>
<seg id="5">He, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and cautions how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wanted to tax the economy and regulate his death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will deal with regulations massively, and he will be strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore taxes for the rich would increase, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it must be invested in that," "" "said Trump and Clinton, almost verbally." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the republicans "state-critical wing of the Republican Party.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be partial discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris Climate Protection Agreement will denounce it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "by contrast, Clinton is reluctant to expand and demand renewables with its investment program:" "" "a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be it."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in terms of infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the translucent trade agreement, do not want to sign the two.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both of us don't want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They are to be paid even better, says Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must go up, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens, is about to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and at worst abused.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile looked narrowly and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of being dropped in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the cousins is difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted assault on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">It seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">At the most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could win a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first and foremost needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his office during a failed state coup last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - in particular the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught at the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports were allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Večsti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious about the West as it looks at the response to the attempted power takeover as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "the continued resentment on the snail empo of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara, claiming that after the attempted coup d "état he demanded support for the elected bodies of state.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel violated and badly treated by the West and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yet despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks the two presidents went out at the press conference saying that they had not even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey fired the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of Putin's narrowest trust for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin, Putin said without giving reasons" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been the representative of Ivanov since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it reads (in Russian) that he later was the chief of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the governmentor.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think that it is the government's most important task to support your activities as head of state with regard to bills and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and to have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convincing?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin for a long time and works as he did for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was praised as a potential President would once again lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - to entrust some complaining items for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV adopted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become president of Russia, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The €1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 bevel ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the entire deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of the future-oriented high- and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances that the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">Until now, a regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D vice-president Christoph Kübel:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build urban areas, you must pay 20 percent of all homes as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">The main point in the town hall is, however, as Bratmann said: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the housing as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, as Bratmann said," "" "There is no agreement between the factions at the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left is still willing to impose tougher conditions on investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, Bratmann, a worsening of the situation on the housing market began.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>

<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, the planned political spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought out-of-date ties from the city.</seg>

<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, one gets away from the goal of the so-called thoroughfare.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about catching people from the sofa and making them more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to television, then video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters created initially for video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overburdened the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured" can be captured.</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the turkey and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person retreats each day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, told the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people who train 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public health awareness campaigns that people want to "take 30 minutes" to "come from the sofa" and "be active every day" stumbled upon deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Whoever pushes sports regularly reduces his chances of getting cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there are mappish game corruption, which must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps such as Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">With Pokemons' success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and will help many people in the hunt to be more active, more active and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="10">19-year-old American gymnast rolled into a multi-campaign title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>

<seg id="12">The American Women Simone Bila turnt on the Swedish beam during the solo multi-campaign of women at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilateral is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-campaign title and the fifth one, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success sets them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years her sport, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she "is the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was expected to last a final test in Brazil, a competition which did not go so much between cheap and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Do not return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi-campaign of women in the art gymnastics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bila took the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark at the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although it insisted on having never planned the future during its long journey, it is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her floor exercises - which contain her typical Tumbling Pass - is attuned to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and trained by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion in the gym, was trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost a competition for competition, a winning streak that will continue as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa slightly led through two turns, the picture murmured.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish beam and ground urns - in which it holds the world title - lurks.</seg>
<seg id="28">She recovered again with 15,433 on the wooden beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor there was another.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her softly when she expected her ending - pure formality - and tears poured in fine glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team captain, which is called "grandma," had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her soaking, she threw kisses to the public, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as it is concerned, the rapidly expanding weet of the 19-year-olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who had killed in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first mass killings of Phoenix while listening to the car and listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-fired weapon while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police told that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a robbery case, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 which were owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Altogether, seven people were killed and two more injured in hispanic neighborhoods within four months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is happening in a residential area in front of a house," told Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that the suspects used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalised because of her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call for the emergency on Friday. it is expected all Saturday with more rainfalls.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded its banks and threatened with large flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, shared that the requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sand sacks increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the community of Tangipahoa alone had demanded tens of thousands of sand sacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used for large parts in southern Louisiana to Saturdays.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather forecast made it possible that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday while it still rained in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The river Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Island is a danger, as these rivers are only slowly flowing into Lake Maurepas.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Tickfav river, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still hatched people from flooding in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were amongst those who were rescued by gloster on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, increases overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another step-son who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we woke up and the water flowed and poured in," "" "said Hansford." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife told Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members would have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had rescued all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were held until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said the flooding" "" "expanded rapidly" "", "as there were still heavy rains and that the authorities were considering evacuation directives." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer reported a 13.75 inch rainfall near Livingstone from midnight to Friday.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the ground was substantially weighted by the rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and Lessons in five boroughs.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a subsidiary in Tangipahoa attacked 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches which were now both flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the community of Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets which were washed from the flood.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="31">"as soon as the water starts to return, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozens of streets were closed because of the flood and sand sacks were provided for the inhabitants to take part, hoping to keep the water out of their houses and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"the last great flooding we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of the Harrison Countys said that it was raining on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his data, a handful of houses were reported to have been reported on Thursday as flooded, but on Friday none of them were reported.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, Manager at Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine under the women's olympic community in the tower and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I've been there since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the US has never been so dominant yet.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess, and Madison Kocian, the Catholicin, round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally mirrors the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnastic women was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gymnastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the top of this sport, but we do not see movement classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. it is also the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and turns Turner primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for coaches and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the municipalities forth countless, young girls, who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, to make a more affordable and easy-to-access exercise training possible.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turn foundation 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for over 15,000 urban adolescents (mainly black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest for the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team golds and thanks, you have so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year on the dismissal of a government report about corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to broadly ignoring widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town councils to ignore electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious reasons would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off bands outside election booths to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he recommends voters to demonstrate their identity to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter only needs to name his name and address.</seg>

<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets electoral scandal in the east of London.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked with Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you are approached from behind, you should turn around first, so that you can see your attacker and get out of the gun line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then hit him with the knee in the lath and twist, while the attacker is crooked with pain, the weapon from his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they focus the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time shift the weight to the weapon and strike the attacker on the chest, then turn the weapon out of its grip, before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it does Mizrachi.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller withdrew his immune system and propulsion of a serious test - by leaking out some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travelling author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk abstained his line on a euro note, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a pull toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the lick of each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is letting himself be.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "", "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought of leaking the rinsing button of a pull toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright talked to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left what he licked was more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowel by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to railway stations to dishwashers from toilets, the task of the immune system was definitely below a sample.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to meet his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test coat showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminometry number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to lick after their luminometer number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands exhibit one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I've done in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company is equipping Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>

<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking just about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had ordered him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left her housing after a deletion with a damage amounting to £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treaticock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their property in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had gaping holes, wooden planks were ripped up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family were resettled and it is believed that they are now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment would no longer be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be regarded as not as beautiful part Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and cures.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours agreed that they saw them fighting on the street and regularly invoked the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing accompanied her and her partner forcibly from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">The detoxication was cheered by lightened neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Enforcement Administration Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, stated that it would have been abusing the family to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown site of the community house waste and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for her behaviour and family, as delogivation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing takes into account.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information they have provided.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope this development will provide comfort to some neighbors and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress, which is located in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloving on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers in the house administration will now have to sweep away rubbish mountains surrounding the house</seg>

<seg id="37">After they were homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house walls were covered with graffiti.</seg>

<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leornard Bernsteins's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director of Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Mary a youth mare.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very latin american.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It's a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we have Bernstein's music really in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this production Bartoli is playing an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers with melancholy about her love with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">Firstly, because it is musically exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">It is therefore clever, naturally also naïve, and very passionate.</seg>

<seg id="19">"" "Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer:" "" "Cecilia is a wonderful artist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honor to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a tremendously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">One sees it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" up-to-date: "this piece deals with prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York residents didn't want them.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same topics and they are just as meaningful today as at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">Weird Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer campaign with - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the country's election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As it hasn't been so until now, it's not possible: summer holidays, heat and land-day elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaign warriors, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the holidaymakers travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the land day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays there are helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and count votes at the end, only to rub vigorously.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to run its election campaign almost by itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dust remains.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one can see from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chatting a bit with the people as he did his legendary predecessor, Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, sailors get cold feet and chancellor Merkel blames the blame for the blooming of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create that" "" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU, with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes electoral campaigns at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale research; Merkel Bundestagroahlkreis is located in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Sachsen than Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "complained Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast-CDU refrains largely from the usual electoral competition on market places and in front of shopping centres with parasols and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that is, Kokert thinks, only plays a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noted that in the country you are unleashing the base that it has to be very strict to find a wire to the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">You are doing it like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely there in the expanses of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU campaigner Kokert on his comrades is also self-revealing: "they have to go where it hurts, namely, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering now has called on his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD had still won 35.6 percent before CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the land day." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, starting at 5.30 a.m. and ending at about 8pm there are praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made it all pretty shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be moved to the south as scheduled at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything will be ready.</seg>
<seg id="8">The work is also commended for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">Citizens can now exit from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic through the village seems to be going back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there have been some significant complaints," "" "said Deputy Head of Deputy Director Florian King for the management of the rehabilitation project." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bacherstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many creeping paths were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fraying.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not complied with, the community also encouraged the measurement vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "there were considerable spills," "" "says King, who informed himself about the situation." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been injected.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was at 77 hourly kilometres in the Tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become calmer.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to sales revenues makes everyone who is asked to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the end customer are produced for other companies, for which the renovation has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "" "maximum slight drop" "", "he also admits that, of course," "" "the runway is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploded are the restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro sales.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the sales revenue deciphered to" "" "far more than 50 percent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the road refurbishment has" "" "thrown back its operation" "" "by two years." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to let the half of his staff be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, District President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation. otherwise, the restaurant benefits from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">For all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family business has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are less frequent passing by because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go down, it's also nice somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his pedigree is returning to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">In spite of the crises with BSE and avian flu Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction on his customers for the greatest crisis he has experienced in their long-term history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="18">In spite of this, he still considers it reasonable and also demands nothing, which doesn't have any chances in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas also present de Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">Some of them are in the process: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more opportunities for detaining people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security audit.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the case of divorces for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as committing crimes or deliberately throwing away their papers in order to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally tricky.</seg>
<seg id="24">Many things even seem undispleased and leaves questions to be answered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the unequal treatment of patient for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks by Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, in view of the high number of refugees, many people were worried about safety.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people profoundly occupied could not be clashed even in election campaign times.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has greatly moved into focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Solitary middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you rush to the comment section to see him under the pseudonym non-allele's middle age with harsh insults, this statement diverts from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reemergence of vinyl records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no horror through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older shoppers retain their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But vote the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I wear a modest grey suit in the middle of a bustling street in Soho, before I stop, hold my hands and say something better than: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observing them.</seg>
<seg id="13">Student from Glasgow, 55, to whom I am of Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle age, a woman, presumably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I already appreciate," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3000 or 4000 boards.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and buy objects he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records tend to be introverted and would like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the youGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media, people who have heard about comeback and are forced to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have led, people tend to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom on trailers of the record company of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realise that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound plate sleeves, from objects that wake up happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's the same with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is an easy way to mentally deal with yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee flops from a panel stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month had not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't own a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while browsing through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle-aged men) notices a "trophies aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-oriented, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in only slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the vinyl records, has a lower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sextary pop instead of experimental jazz reconciles from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but nailing psychic trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of the plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a window-shopping experience than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">It does not earn much, therefore collecting disks is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">As I give the impression to smuggle the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one who gives the most for luxury items such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of Yougov vote, they are not considered, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They do not spend their thursday tomorrow with security by cheating through record stores on Berwick Street and sheets, while avoiding the staring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false moderator, who shakes nothing of the middle-aged men's shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a hearing this week the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energydrinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture notes that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would be a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that the stores and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also assumed that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but acknowledged that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">The judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the decline was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in the public and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids' café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure was" "" "for these children of a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of survivors in the Jungellager had risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in newcomers over the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-er Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday evening to an abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stitching, back, line and raw power to gain gold - its first olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - the UK's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day, could fall back in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for UK - but it will probably not - that at least one Briton tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago they lost each game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji commenced miraculously and allowed the attacks to bounce GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau froze in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With only four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly grasped the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A shackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Veremalua turned a Touchdown in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa has added a new one since the re-start and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vbreatho Ravouvou pressured by further weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed down to the line to make a goal.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GGB was still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB performed basic changes at half-time and closed the fijiian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-season until Joshua Tuisova ran through a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt at GB, made a Touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Osseeinsulan, whose fans sang, flags swung and danced on the platform.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged themselves and GB brutally kicked in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day, Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight half-finals match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the boys forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant later tackling Marcus Watson, brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emoteric gold than with these games and that wants to be called.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 tough pieve who enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning invented an additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympic old in the two-seater without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports that set such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all, her 39th ingested insert, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athlete, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of trigger to geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to incremental progress that make the difference and no-one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, he spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty awful situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes slightly the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances it is the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and walked around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory her first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve-wracking morning doing something more than usual and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning who was a Captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>

<seg id="2">The managing director of the "VeitensteinGroup" water utility association, Ruppert Göller, will retire.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "the association is regarded as" "" "exemplary in Bavaria" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Frankish drinking water utility association as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some time ago, it was in the original on a contribution made by the Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the water forum of the Lower Franconian Government dignified the association.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "the work of the VeitensteinGroup applies" "" "Bavaria-wide as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years old in the kennel association, has 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water utility of the VeitensteinGroup, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150,000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 places and hamlet with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The congregations are the municipalities of Kirchheim, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts are available for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current President, Breitbrunner Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was appointed as a waterwart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Confederation in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budgetary planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events, it called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation for farmers, the refurbishment of the elevated tank (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and I have always added new additions, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her speech, Göllers praised faithful, reliable and correct service over the past 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water utility association and he has lived the water utility association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he presented the successful concept of the VeitensteinGroup to reduce the rate of nitrate before the Wasserforum des Unterfranken.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received very much recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised waterwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterwart and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together, we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he called the well-construction and the re-structuring of the association's association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the quarry in the high-container at Kirchlouder on a 3rd January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained because one filled the high-tank of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Sturmer from Lauter who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing facilities for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economy Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following discussions with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only if the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent will fall.</seg>
<seg id="10">But this also does not rise in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">Thus the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful efforts have been particularly significant for the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "with regard to our campaign" "" "Steel is the Future" "" "it is a first step." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "climate and employment targets must also be weighed in the reform of the emissions trading system," "" "explained IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer of products threw steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are making price dumping Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel have an effect, on the other hand economic prospects in China have risen.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have been stagnating again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the end ThyssenKrupp had not wanted to exclude closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as Steel Division rushed on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a brief increase in May, the quantity produced went back to the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has risen by two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">Due to an improved order situation, the association expects an increase in orders in the coming months.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she finished the subject of music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old is singing in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and more alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describing hacklers.</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular gatherings enable seniors to socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her chorus:" "" "to speak and organize oneself, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be tiring in the positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Seniors train a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who regularly requests his lungs will not get out of the puff even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "elderly people often have a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Seniors-Organizations." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakes many memories, often connected with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, self-dementia patients develop long-distance events.</seg>
<seg id="19">Singing will also demand a special performance to the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone do so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that you experience through singing in the choir, "Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I take long for something, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Seniors have different options in search of the right offer, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings among the circle of friends in a senior choir, you can simply join them.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the Choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors are also found on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbours for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone who wants to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="11">The detonation near the beach resort Patong, popular with tourists, was injured by a taxi driver.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded, killing an urban clerk.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive charge went into the air in a flower beet in front of the territory of the Coastal Police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwestern coast and in Chumphon on the south-east coast called for several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes out of a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was called.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said Army general Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that it is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express themselves about possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the actions of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities have received secret information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however, they were not informed of the exact date and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group lies behind the proposals.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police instructed their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are still smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used for years by Thailands King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the case-hungry bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will be no need for travelling to these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">The junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, benefits itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for many years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in a popular Hindu Shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic meter waste water amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the waste water system Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zuluberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a heavy calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the household by the District Office Kulmbach, it was found that underlay for these sewage plants.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zuluberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Head of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt presented the panel, a re-calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the previous calculation period will also be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the fact that all three sewage plants are relatively small, with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the wastewater volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result of the age of refurbishment and repair expenses, all three installations will continue to have a considerable scope, not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair.</seg>
<seg id="14">The complex in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zuluberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced by a damage in the wastewater plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">After nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be removed, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to meet the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants, expenses for operation and maintenance were "full."</seg>
<seg id="20">In the process, Schmidt, the market town of large entertainment costs, has remained spared for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage system could not be extended by these facilities because there are deficits.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian cartoon</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to race.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, self-propelled tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All faults arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have raised criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting the App Blackface promoted or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week several users hit a filter, who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and abandoned cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "jaundice."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism, the filter reminded of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widespread, wrote that the filter was" "" "hurtful and gentle" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face was drawn into the degrading extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling bank.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more different in race than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats Filters creates a picture that is insulting to a user, "it is much more difficult for such things to remain unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu, for the big part, criticized only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they do not have a diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a speaker, the company recently recruited a personnel manager focusing on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "Zhu also said she was closed to her Snapchat account and added," "" "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K.." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Central Command Intelligence Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence reports, typically associated with high-level CentCom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive picture of US efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground have allowed and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom range up to the top of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to alter the reports, it shows how analysts exposed themselves to pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts," "" "said the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mozambique would start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, member of the Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of the year 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command tops changed the intelligence reports to reduce the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigation continues.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are being conducted by the Secretary General of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created a moderately restricted process for the preparation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest ranking Demokrat in the Committee, Member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "the morals referred to analysts and" "" "gave too little space for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House in the CentCom analysts as to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported cases of investigation by the Pentagon general inspector, who were admitted to complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the General Inspector's investigations were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of disputes of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward only to a small occupation force in Iraq and little time pretending to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker states that contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant effect on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's damnally commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessively positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retiring in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="7">The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two will reach the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed one will take a little longer from the strong Dutch, which will lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time in three years she had a hockey slayer in her hands (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>

<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the door-row in the first half of the game with a backlash of the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India went into the game without a win, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and then loaded the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is also, it's the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapable, a furious relay race between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is passed from the Crossbow to the swimmers to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue in the queue without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been under these well-known names sent to Prime Time, based on sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmers, gymnast or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic jumping competition.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame did not highlight every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swim and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have a modest argument for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline was an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse the last 16 years that many of those I had questioned did not know that it is actually an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I'm not an expert, but an enthusiast enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has a humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the spanish El Trampoline, which means" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, fencing and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympic programme, they are rated according to version, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medalists must carry on in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, upwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only hunt the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further highlight in the TV broadcast: the world or the Olympiarist.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find myself tiresome when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifying and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming around 13: 00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will emit the end-rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympic mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anguling and the objective of male athletes - as the male US Turner suggests recently according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is waiting for his air-bark, new fan community.</seg>

<seg id="4">Witnesses say that dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with police at gunshots.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapsing?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into ever more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or imprisoned, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and don't have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a teacher in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use up to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions continue to rise along the Eritrea border; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line prompted hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberal Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been forced more or less in recent years, will exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of exposure to the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate through the social media because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate about Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians have stated that they were assembled in such a way as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia predominantly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and business, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Miechu, a leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is illegally dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, had been Prime Minister until his death in a non-publicized illness in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special agents to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia was experiencing such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands of protesters protested, apparently fuelled by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed, even if they were less than in recent months and this time of turmoil went relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked Gondar, an amharan city, headed by Tigray and the hatred against the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests surrounding the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse into an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump declares his statement Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump was trying to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by fearing that his repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communication skills of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings together his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump withdrew in terms of the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, where Mr Trump said in a number of interviews, he said the accusation was totally serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism rashes on Mr. Trump as he attempts to direct the focus of his campaign for falling survey values to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found his speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he had a strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Mrs. Clinton's e-mails, but he explained later, "Of course, I thought that sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction drops out." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more corrosive tone as his survey values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr Trump is generally trying to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he frequently uses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But as he continues to focus attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal collaborators into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent interviewers, gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it hocks, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to expand by allowing them to assert the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of jumping around and being biased at each of his words.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trump's excuse as only a further proof that he was unfit for the Presidential Administration.</seg>

<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a delicacy, President Roosevelt had a faible for sophisticated delicacies of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland terrapin soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">Its menu on that day was somewhat more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Hellman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to Americans how to eat them."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes's latest book "Chop Suey" was from Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" talks about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small local snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered wood roast, this found the couple suitable for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "rich food was very popular," "" "Brickman said." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>

<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Crews of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War." "" "a Square Meal" "" "traces the ways the country was dealing with, not to be the land of land." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food for the Americans was a central theme," "" "Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Just as tense was the new budget: mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserolle as a "wonderful way to recycle food residues," Brickman noted, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the focal point of American cuisine for many years, became a rarely serviced luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Peculiar blends have been tried out as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction has precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen common sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, brick prepared a dish from that epoch, baked onions with peanut butter, too.</seg>

<seg id="30">Peanut butter and fried onions do not match each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the house recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, budgetary economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - denounced the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing prescriptions and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politics" and the challenge to transform pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">Particularly tasty are the reports on the government's response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-Me-cake-eating posture.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he publicly praised the simple Iowa peasant kitchen of his kitchen, he fed as the million-million man of the world he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and carried a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was gloriously realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor asked him to postpone an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the recruiting of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt meant that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression, dealing with food, was discarded as soon as the country came back on its legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food, says Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation, this shark was allowed to return to the sea on board the Sanna research ship.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandsharks only get offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Greenland shark floats along the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches just 1.220 metres in average.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it accelerates the five-meter-long animal up to a full 2.6km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this lifestyle influenced by slowness seems to be a patronage for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case by a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "mad," "" "commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist believed that Greenland hairies are becoming more of a stone age.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland-sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow motion measured them when they stared six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, this sharks make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the polar sea and seek cadavers that torment from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland hairies that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the greatest 502 cm measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lenticular core of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is already created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins in it will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably many carbon-14 in the lenticular core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Therefore, after the early 1960s, their birth was to lie in the atmosphere when nuclear weapons resorted to large amounts of this radioactive carbon.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimetres in length, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland hairies had normal carbon-14 amounts in their lentil nucleus, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers of the length were able to assign an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood on the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the increase obviously leave for at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such Methuseles live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the record holder, a 211 year old Greenland wal, in whose bacon on the neck had a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs into flame-flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">They later mature later - and age more slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible as possible early as possible," explains the evolutionist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should, on the other hand, invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="1">Jewish director crushes Berlin hotel, because Israeli preselection was removed by "Arab" invitation - RT News</seg>
<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media watch after he betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli preselection as Arab guests were requested "according to a staff."</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah" left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann attempted to find Israel at the hotel's country code list.</seg>
<seg id="5">The country, however, was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to choose Israel via its own call center.</seg>

<seg id="12">The reason behind this was more fury in the director.</seg>
<seg id="13">"most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre-election be deleted," the employee of Lanzmann was quoted.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.</seg>
<seg id="15">We were horrified and dismayed by this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is really shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">This does not require explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a quite large resonance on the Internet, in which people called the whole a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "some of them signed the Kempinski Hotel that they had" "" "indulged" "" "the alleged" "" "Arab guests" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "ashamed," "" "said it in another article stating that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is next to a synagogue." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Haigerloch: pilgrimages to the Doors of Mercy</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna travelled to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were tackled.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the period up to the next Roma trip of all the minor strants in the next two years, the senior round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the decision was finally decided for the Bishop's City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at Freiburger Münster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruene, Haigerloch, and Heiligenstadt went on their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before Pastor Storey sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage crosses and told the Pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb, by train, we drove to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Hungarian darling woman stood and so the pilgrim's way from Münster was resigned.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a short impulse with various prayers, songs and text texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the minis on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made a stop to sing a song of specially assembled Pilgrims song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parish halls of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and tonic dinner and breakfast at the stage targets.</seg>
<seg id="13">It continued on the second day on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after that, the trip to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting route, had to be lowered at first around 500 metres altitude and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the lake in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning pulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy the minis arrived at Freiburger Münster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a little impulse, God was thankful here.</seg>
<seg id="19">Minis by Kooperator Markus Obert was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgaumetropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon I went by train to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end, all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="1">Scotsman Callum Skinner stormed home when Brite won gold for cycling</seg>
<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint at the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year old from Glasgow took up the anchor that his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. he took the legend haughty when he stormed home to win a victory from the Favourites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took only a modest sixth place in London at the London Track World Championships in March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the substitution of Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in time as Hindering.</seg>
<seg id="8">His retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinds, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put in the qualification rounds an Olympic squad, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British Trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap he fell short, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation coming into a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinds when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic chord in the final round and defeated world champions.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph of 2012 on the Kenny and Hoys side, there was a hint that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said:" "" "it feels like the whole GB of flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined together as a team during the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same from Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is next to the sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Brown Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified for the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will be held today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought with agents before the qualification yesterday when functionaries were calling him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie entered the world record time in 4: 13.260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to win a troop of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were downtrodden.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, such as Shane Sutton's resignation in April in the midst of sexism and mobbingvores as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one sees the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GBs, which at the perfect moment reached its climax, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="9">The enamel of Alcoa in Portland looses money and risks closure.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the Managerin and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to cry," "" "Kendall wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The unveiling of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians?), spooky reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the all-popular show biz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest).</seg>
<seg id="6">That puts the cliché plot almost every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacremnant brought the sentence, "You thought we've forgotten you?"), with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris has had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of dashians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes her to have beaten the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles an illustrated book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista's 832 pages of advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The disclosure of his cover-star is eagerly awaited, that in the last two years pictures of the magazine even before the official announcement permeated.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "celebrities who like" "" "as" "" "models that are celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar-winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence had been on the cover for 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true for Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenny's success does not like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jennifer's position in the world of fashion has always been tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-Model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "The Mistresses of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But looking at the mischief seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) there are significant losses for the SPD and CDU governing parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute INSA for the Bild-Zeitung (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could continue to rule in the North, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">But in both federal states the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to position the head of the government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD toppled from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party only smiles just before the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is contested between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previous 18.4 percent), the AfD would represent 19 percent for the first time in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite a slight loss of 6 per cent (previously 8.7 percent), the Green Party returned to Schwerin Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 percent each.</seg>

<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather chunky.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few euros, fans can still buy the devices on the internet, but they originate somehow from the Stone Age of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">But 20 years ago, the communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could provide a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax, the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible per HTML browser, albeit tormenting.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was pretty proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could guess in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>

<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams commented that "this sort of Hin-and-Her struggle between the time-tantalizing open source community and the circumference is already underway since the invention of scorers," and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the projections of a new NASA climate model Venus was probably habitable once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine if Venus could have refuted Earth-like conditions with its hot, waterless surface and carbon dioxide atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from quick evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a Sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to its daylight exposure for almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface of much of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, similar to evolution that was previously thought by planet explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans were evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their Hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus as we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers to gather the most complete catalog of rotational rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers to understand why stars rotate in constellation-pile to different rates as well as in what connection the rotational periods with planet emergence are.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other starlings, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sternenhaufen of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotations, these mature stars repel large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star age, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star stain, such as sunspots.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars are rotating more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars rotating slower tracks than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the cluster of stars of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the cluster of stars of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data lau: as perfide represses hacker their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting specific companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes, under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past 12 months have at least once, some times more victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the fees required by the perpetrators to re-use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential for extorting ransom is much higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we currently watch a terrifying rapid evolution of malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most malwareprograms were designed to send ads.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">After all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was terrifying quickly over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, she searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as after archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals lastingly.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the testers' demands.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final key code to the files, the victims must pay money - usually in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage occurs when a ransomware is added.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always tell the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with blackmail users and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually attempt to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their casualties by chatting how they can pay via Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites or decrypt for example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must negotiate a part hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of potentially high and relatively high-risk profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share their work, Security expert Chester Wisniewski explains: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual testers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for additional hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the Forums in the underground, buys the set from a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals then commission spammers with spreading," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of corporate IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to repel ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement, the perpetrators will instead threaten the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">The damage potential, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also set out entirely new goals on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz defect, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR-V: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a mini van.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be really flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it doesn't work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the upper side of the cockpit is falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l with uplifted and 1026 l with backrest backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chairs and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor up to a ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment is well loaded, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">Four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a little more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency brake assist (operates at speeds 32), the collision warning system and lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent template reacts to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI-jack lie under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around forever, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep well before the wake-up ringing.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleeping disorders and more than ten percent perceive their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Medicine and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What we see for the time being, however, is the insomnia, that is, an inhalation and sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just passing through sleep many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of directors in the German house medical association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There are organic, mental or behavioural factors behind it, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is common especially with depression," "" "says Dr. Clark." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors determine each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disc, every two or three hours will wake up and possibly start to worry about everyday problems and worries.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and is compromised the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as gastric or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate sleep disorders it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include, among other things, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dormant medical professionals hardly exist in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary dormitory medical center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why you should first contact the family doctor if you have trouble sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the case of snoring with breathing dropouts, for example, in the case of snoring, in case of sickness, insomnia or if one does not find the cause of a lack of sleep, Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After clapping, one goes to bed at the normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera draws the sleeping ends on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which you can set for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "she said:" "" "regular dormitory and stand-up times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleeping, avoid alcohol and do not watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between still a rest of cobblestones: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like that at first sight, but the police count them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a beer shop.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone" "" "ugly!" "" "sprayed on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new lease apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is, however, preferred in recent weeks with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, particularly the Berlin Interior senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard way of police action against the project, the area referred to as the "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadett smiths, with 300 police officers were cleared, the police patroled three weeks of official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown home owners, the construction workers were renovating the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers marched under the cheering of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon, the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and nursery schools.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wished for majority of the police protection from the vandaliatory left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin senator and the police establish between the house occupants and their neighbours, does not exist so clearly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and a high risk of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Main Street very close to the Riga landscape.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Riga region were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and polling liners from all over the world: residents from GDR times and former home occupiers also share their neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Riga region are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be recognized by discarded slices or freshly painted facades, which were thrown using colored bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road has been mentioned this year together with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: criminal offenders such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The largest part of the criminal offences do property damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rental house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">In terms of violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they were certainly not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the studied architect her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and has stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her to get back to the street: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the part of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by sightless newbuildings in former baubles, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well-equipped are living here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">Frustration arises on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding of bred dogs, who are annoyed by colour-bombings: the house projects and the left-wing were part of the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who come from should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area who can complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee representative for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the management team around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups, refugees, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is there now, the cutting-edge woollen musk, which is above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Some - less ridiculing but rather targeted on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a cutting-edge woollen carp.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not her central area, Annika Deuschle means.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "said Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Landratsamt is responsible for the municipality and job centre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find any private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Until now, it does not work, so that one relies on private apartments such that Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is not only with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence there are internships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and job opportunities for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People should develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it needs offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also administration and volunteers are jumping.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who at some point develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are also problems," "" "customer honest," "" "people who don't care at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalization after recent occurrences, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine client says quite clearly," "" "what some people may call naive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also subject to the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins were completely revocated.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "said Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look for activities on site and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that a new pile of refugees and migrants will soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">In fact, it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
