Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not exactly friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing Israel &apos;s continuing housing construction and th@@ rows Net@@ any@@ ahu a lack of will in the peace process .
the deal between the two further deterior@@ ated by the deal promoted by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor decided to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb had told him that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ pse of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call later .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed it .
one day after shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb Moti@@ v@@ ated .
the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees knew , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time , there were some tendencies to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised him , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously requested the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , for which Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he was not aware of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb is no longer able to answer .
after fle@@ eing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Spur , when he returned from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as again in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
before he could be arrested , Lamb p@@ aus@@ ed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the entrance .
it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and education .
he obtained a doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gy in spring .
one of her long @-@ time friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met with common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met two years ago on a summer fair , Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
later they played one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he had stopped Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ce Night at night 5 September for the last time when Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ics play in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people took part in the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ ahn@@ wache &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sang &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s told Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb described Pr@@ enti@@ ce as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us is planning to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says it &apos;s not going to hire as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and season workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it was planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers all over the country . in the 2014 Christmas season , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees is rising from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , Christmas business grows closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an im@@ pending documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ n and an arm &apos;s length of being with the princess of Wales during a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel movie ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - on the fr@@ inge of the General Assembly of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ separ@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values indicate that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in poll@@ s , it has ( yet ) not worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hes &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ ump in staying power and begin to let their dollars flowing to t@@ opp@@ le it .
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
s@@ ling@@ shots r@@ ump percentage is rot@@ ated by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 per cent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a poll@@ ed by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent saying the same about pumping ) .
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 per cent of the repub@@ li@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see Tr@@ ump Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is seen in the nation &apos;s first nation @-@ nation state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and almost six out of ten independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
repub@@ li@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they raise their scholars , repub@@ li@@ can voters consider Tr@@ ump to be real .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say four out of ten from CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
total disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters look at the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump sums up almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to s@@ ling@@ ing leadership while the anti @-@ jump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ uses .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other repub@@ li@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have given their votes firmly .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they left the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have made their opinion are dou@@ bly so common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump named immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse of 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will deter decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post Survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently will do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs on new high@@ s .
Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now have about half of the support of repub@@ li@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ si@@ ders .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey conducted by ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of the four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent dis@@ satisfied and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ itely angry . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here you can find the most expensive con@@ domini@@ um - with a view of the North Sea resort .
in the street , a square meter of a home roof building costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , one price increases like pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German homes - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nothing - per square meter , well marked .
but it &apos;s good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ ch in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to a deserved 3 : 0 victory at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have described a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the witch &apos;s armchair by Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Train@@ ers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 82 . ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth season success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
at his 28th visit to the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership , Müller was given the ben@@ ign assistance of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ Roberto , who made a shot of the world champion as flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bavarian captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich residents kept saying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated imagination , without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home matches in the roy@@ alty , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund also stum@@ bled ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went bol@@ dly , but in their offensive ende@@ a@@ vors , however , they often become harmless to work .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on Link@@ sau@@ lt Douglas Costa , which was rarely through O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i &apos;s former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field on the left upper tor@@ che@@ que .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion passed the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half of them had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , as Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ a Brown beat Poland &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto rec@@ alled his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved into their habit@@ ual game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set needle @-@ stit@@ ches .
but on the door@@ keeper , Manuel Neu@@ er , he was reli@@ eved .
so , for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ e over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , back in the cabin after muscular problems , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports steering committee Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who wants to make something different from it is vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and later made it clear 13 minutes later .
in front of the game it was time to craw@@ l in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern fans had prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich supporters with striking sticks .
at least one Bayern fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , thereby har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study .
good news : when doing away , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of pre@@ mat@@ urely losing their teeth in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 fa@@ eces .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val gum , stresses the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphasize .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear whether smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one has to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health to high age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of ag@@ gregation hit the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists b@@ ump on rem@@ nants of late anti@@ quity at the Cologne Rhine bank
for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
historians are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments since the start of the construction work on the Rhine .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Arch@@ ae@@ ological Natural History .
in the third construction section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , the archae@@ ologists became fi@@ erc@@ ely successful .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier .
besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman arrives at the station in Fu@@ gu@@ id@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ der , the Federal Police is asking the population for help .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
to elu@@ ci@@ date the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function clearly corresponds to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens dare , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
the TTIP will create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceeding show con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first instance is scheduled for the first time .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
until now , the parties involved agreed among themselves on arbit@@ ers , there was no possibility of opposition to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens won &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and fair@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work on an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded mainly by large corporations are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of concur@@ rent justice , to control the damages of the tax@@ pa@@ yers , break national laws , or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organisations like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Camp act &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German Minister of Economic Affairs , Matthias Gro@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
the Commission took into consideration essential points in the reform , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked in the spring with other EU Trade Ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the law@@ suits of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was said .
when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne prime club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him stands a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells about different places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they came from and what it looks like , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative artist .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fting into great opul@@ ence at any time .
the rum@@ or arises , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive number of expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live meet him guitar and ban@@ jo .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ u@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) a polished masterpiece appeared in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
overl@@ apping of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the amer@@ ican Bill@@ board charts and lacks an annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after highly productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic offset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth record studio album is still well orchest@@ rated , yet supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ b .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows are here for the colourful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a band of five .
in the dark @-@ colored ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has been available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without judging a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; disk . &quot;
only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , plays acousti@@ cally a few older songs and finally bows into thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s report
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut as Prime Minister has been eag@@ erly anticipated since his election .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s fra@@ ming and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MEPs from near .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has been the focus of several T@@ ory @-@ Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , calling on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party initially supported him as a leader .
the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be &quot; st@@ acking &quot; within the Labour Party , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C Conference that Labour would present changes to remove all the idea of a limitation altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Workers and R@@ ent Minister , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23.@@ 000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss , over the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader , who promised a different policy set , says he has received &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ ming is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will be subjected to serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people instead .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he doesn &apos;t take part - for example if Mr Cameron is abroad .
he also had the idea that other colleagues would occasionally speak the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Com@@ mons , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; punch @-@ punch @-@ theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the cra@@ fting of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the meeting with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need for far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated rate growth in the United Kingdom
the Po@@ und rose hip @-@ like after data , which indicate an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid goal SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and most earned estim@@ ation of the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index ended with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
following encouraging news from the competitor group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion $ through a stock sale as part of his strategy of reducing debt .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his estim@@ ation for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the chief of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , &quot; he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are less additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber in the capital : on the Bi@@ eber @-@ expedition in Berlin

the type with plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros difficult .
rather even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ kt@@ oria Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name R@@ itz Carl@@ ton .
not bad .
hundreds of fans attended Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Victoria from Poland .
but since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs at the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the construction of the Bi@@ eber : here you are living I@@ dol , whose poster hangs up in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mom@@ my E@@ wa deserved in half a year .
if at all .
she says : &quot; actually , my Wi@@ kt@@ oria had to sit in the tenth grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfil her dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory education ?
who is it@@ ching it ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber himself does not .
it has already taken care of it anyway .
for advertisement in the advertising break of the supermarket , he scored three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ p company , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account .
and with every doll that looks like he and goes over the counter , Bi@@ eber also collects .
when Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber is drinking a coffee , one mar@@ vels at the window pane .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is in the United States and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; to No. 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA plac@@ ard brings Lebanon to potato dig@@ ger idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and indeed in the potato dig@@ ger , which the Ol@@ denburg @-@ burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a plac@@ ard of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat were put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes from D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen accidentally on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer has been spinning in its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tural to the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Lebanese has meanwhile been registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
therefore , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y how much meat and how much sk@@ e@@ wers are sk@@ e@@ wers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
Met@@ cash ki@@ cks off anti @-@ ageing campaign to combat aging
Met@@ dice tries to protect the I@@ GA branch in front of an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing over the social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ a will publish more details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment will conduct its annual investor strategy day .
it is a lot on the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analysts Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ ar@@ cash € 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ a &apos;s high fixed @-@ cost base could cost around 13 million dollars from interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ a &apos;s sales in food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenue from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt at equal pressure on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler is resist@@ ing and investing more than $ 150 million to equal sales of col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week , and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by rapidly growing fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging rehabilitation programmes are to be set to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit again in four years for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ ris and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour after the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger one of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s in@@ famous confrontation with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison running out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ ro , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic at the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite en@@ vious of is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was pulled a little into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a bit too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also did not support the decision to take account of the important preliminary decision starting on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term firm component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick has quickly made the move to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we are trying to support him , we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and sm@@ iled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all the attempts to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acting in a land of no man and responded with rebellion .
the people who fled from violence got stuck in a strip of land on the street between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more come from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ences on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border did not agree on a common immigration policy one day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc at a meeting in Brussels .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ crow@@ ding Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action between Brussels or its neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency situation in two southern regions called on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country was also planning to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants across the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws which came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government allowed to build along the southern border with Serbia to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the process of deplo@@ ying the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were caught in trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ setting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence as quickly as possible .
Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was reached .
chaos converted the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to push for themselves .
some 20 managed to get there , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national survey
former U.S. Secretary of State , H@@ illary Clinton , continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against her on the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 per cent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion says what candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some winn@@ ings .
Clinton has a great lead in women and id@@ l@@ eness , but these projections have decreased .
their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
but Clinton has a major advantage in the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ ander with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries nationwide say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprisingly , that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed among those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about one quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the di@@ ci@@ bility are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice @-@ president has a potential for the presidential office in the balance sheet , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
of Clinton &apos;s followers more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton has increased his lead ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month .
bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about elec@@ ti@@ bility .
similarly as last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable for these voters of the prim@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features among voters in the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best suited to the three candidates in hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
in general , democratic voters of the prim@@ aries also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as foreign minister continue to be made , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions .
but it is another story in the American public as a whole .
half of Americans are unhappy with their explanation , while only about a third is content .
the public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion has worsen@@ ed .
there are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy from the voters of their party , this remains a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not regard them as an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the eligible votes nationwide see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good grades for leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush successfully cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey has been eliminated , and others lose their support dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . support is growing 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the pol@@ l of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and exceeds Tr@@ ump among repub@@ li@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Charlie Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the deepest , and 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also clearly presented Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
looking at a car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : at a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has reached this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
on the other hand , bath temperatures still offer the Mediterranean : in the East it can even reach up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood poll@@ uted with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
almost two years after a student died during a terrible ritual of a student service in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ fr@@ at@@ ernity attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police with .
officials said he was charged with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches and then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g fain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils , and generally placed the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood above Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly attached to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
one County Grand Jury from Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of the third count for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and formation of a criminal organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned so we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation with the local population .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest
an increase in interest comes , and the home@@ se is falling , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance on how to proceed .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank under@@ lined so severely that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find out that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a interest rate increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions .
here is a view on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things more volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be weighed 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest rate increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , in the past 35 years the market is mostly on the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to increasing interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Chief System strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ denti@@ ally occur later in the hei@@ gh@@ tening cycle and the yield begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at the rate of interest of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 118 cent interest increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; said Deutsche Bank .
market participants turned to interest in the F@@ ed all year , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all acceleration cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions have been placed very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far this has been 74 months .
the fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic course .
in bonds , the returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the increase cycle the bond yields fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to conver@@ ging between longer and shorter bonds and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is interesting to note that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted itself to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has intensified its strategy .
in large and large companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit from increasing interest rates and making local products more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will get worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively to three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , &quot; Gold@@ man said .
in addition to pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars .
savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts agree on how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the sender for his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also gra@@ bbed the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; walks &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conserv@@ atives , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer differ from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also gra@@ bbed the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously stated examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC director general rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far from commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning about Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything else about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it was harder to work harder to engage the audience than did so in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports was under fire to kick off commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often deb@@ ated because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC way .
he added that he wants the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house st@@ ables &quot; when the next time it starts a series of entertainment .
however , he refused to exclude the order from further rows of The Voice in the future , or to issue money from the fee counter for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones
experts believe that Black Friday stopped spending in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s major shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say that there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developing over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sale of the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is going on , and we may experience that the growth will be reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for the decreasing sales .
experts believe buyers will hold their purchases prior to this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers focused on their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites pl@@ ung@@ ed off .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the purch@@ as@@ ers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that from £ 5 spending a little more than £ 1 was spent online .
in some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than a third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of men bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online instead of the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 victims are borne by Muslims during the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia ow@@ es the breakdown to some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed as a crane crashed into Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ners filled , mostly dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ ist@@ em Cem@@ etery .
the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane was passed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell to the beds .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi king ruled over the construction company of the bin Laden family for the disaster , which left 3@@ 94 wounded , a san@@ ction .
the bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mo@@ sh@@ ee Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ lers will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands of people who continue to come to the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the crane &apos;s arm when it was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an Arabic version of the decree , published by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was banned from abroad .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a large mo@@ sch@@ ee inner courtyard , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the H@@ add@@ lers held later this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not release any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over major construction projects .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a retired son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the collapse of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
government representatives suggested that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other wounded receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q boss says that the time of cheap East European tra@@ des@@ men is over
British increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe has increased
this means that 200 other scre@@ w@@ fix shops targeting professional tra@@ des@@ people will be opened
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q sales points nationwide
Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , city chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes
if you can handle it skill@@ fully using a hammer or brush for painting walls , today you seem to belong to a minority .
because Brit@@ ons increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique aus@@ ry , the new CEO of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY store chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled crafts@@ man from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete .
this is why King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more scre@@ w@@ fix shops dedicated to professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to deal more women in B &amp; Q Shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more towards balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;

officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , at the Landes@@ gericht K@@ lagen@@ furt , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of government .
on this accus@@ ation , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the defend@@ ants used funds from club accounts in 2006 to 2011 , which they could disp@@ oni@@ ze in their functions for private purposes .
it damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact was eliminated by the Chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ats , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that the association did not come into existence at any time .
the sports officials were only charged with compens@@ ations and the sports club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; at that time , we were faced with the situation : do we continue or block the club ? , &quot; said one of the accused , in the bread @-@ making profession of the major audi@@ tor of the financial office .
he then decided to take over this task with his co @-@ worker and co @-@ defend@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in taking action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made .
furthermore , in case of financial success , compens@@ ations of compens@@ atory damages had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore one part of the allowance damages was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus was on the account .
for this reason , flat @-@ rate and non @-@ detailed bookings appeared , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and austerity books administered jointly the two defend@@ ants , said the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial statements , it was important only to have the freedom of the debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against the one official investigation of office abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
that had been set@@ backs , the defend@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to the statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent had no answer to this question for a long time .
then he finally said he had believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compensation agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claim compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer tells you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never bought a cent salary , he only calculated o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting .
he added 1.000 Euro per month to diets , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants could not provide accurate documentation for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an audit in which everything was considered correct , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to mil@@ eage .
all the deport@@ ations were made in cash , so that he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard performs another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts currently underway for three years , Compu@@ terri@@ ese will be able to disman@@ tle further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up .
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut off 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) were to be saved , the company shared on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the exploitation of 55@@ ,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed .
at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP still employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share sold 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto group , which has become a printing company , is currently spl@@ itting up : in this way , the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data stores for companies and other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers after its services replaced the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
as a result , revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive adjustments to the industry &apos;s change .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took part in the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and the water @-@ th@@ row@@ er against several hundred opened refugees .
Euron@@ ews @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border check@@ point .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the polic@@ emen there was a police line , and behind the polic@@ emen there was a water @-@ th@@ row@@ er ready .
between 40 and 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles after officials .
the officials first stopped using pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a little .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had breath@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Serbian police press spokes@@ persons also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
the Time of Dec@@ ision on Inter@@ est Rates for the US National Bank
the world is watching when the US National Bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade interest rates have been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view , the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and hold interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Chief of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances .
it warned the markets to adjust to an up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , but the signs point out that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death cont@@ ingent at Delta State University &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left behind exc@@ uses &quot; &quot; &quot;
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleague later on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could undo it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said he shot on someone and killed someone .
lamb said to the staff of the emergency headquarters that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a sweet dog is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb 45 , saying , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted to undo it .
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb ran 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he was not aware of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities told Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but were friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said Pr@@ enti@@ l was her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a Light@@ ning dog , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He won &apos;t go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb ran his car , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University , as his life @-@ law acknow@@ le@@ dges on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organisation .
with around 1,000 executives around the world , group conversion will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and upgrades the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the company &apos;s aim of real@@ ignment is to generate a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , and announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the board for passenger operations in the future .
the cheap flight line Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Executive Board of Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with its new position , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of collective bar@@ gaining with the pilot association Cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ marked strike on this Thursday .
this was the reason for the union .
the theme of the talks will be the retirement regulations for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d@@ ashboard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline has led to a number of strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilots , the background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , the airline stores routes to the Group &apos;s own cheap line of Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Manchester United Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brings the left outer def@@ enders to weeping and closing it for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg structure and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated on in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , has it very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not punished Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

with the European Championship in France , the UK def@@ enders have an additional incentive to recover until June next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very serious injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched it , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 5 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad doing it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it by heart .
unless you &apos;re David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to leave Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a news on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , shows instead a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this were not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly as follows : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ ficially and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father it seems unlikely that Cameron is so un@@ familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy sounds like the local environment is rav@@ aged by the cov@@ eted Lor@@ ax , a squ@@ at@@ y , me@@ ager nature , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokesperson said that the text was probably coming from Cameron &apos;s electoral office .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the Ka@@ der chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a one @-@ off victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Chess Page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Bat@@ ting setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is developing as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test plane , is an option for the attack .
on this news : Adam Ly@@ th separates from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze .
in its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , da - and I &apos;ve said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , you would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully beats further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even though he did not get such good performances , and that does not surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son ahead of him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first put Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales walks in , and he is a drummer , whom I highly in@@ timi@@ date .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he achieved 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this of course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to let mos@@ ques be hit by Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ punch and got four squ@@ e@@ aks , appeared , and I didn &apos;t do anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he immediately made three hundred r@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he was very impressed as a young man .
people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no great number of backup cran@@ ks that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh wind , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot was given a similar break to Australia and I did not have a problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .

in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it even if it end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who desires an outside @-@ looking Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long exp@@ atri@@ ates such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande is looking back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left .
it is difficult to imagine that they will be torn out of a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
that is why some such ministers may intentionally plan not to give useful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s refer@@ en@@ al campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing out of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were with all his cra@@ ft@@ iness .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone h@@ acking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ countries that most of our large newspapers have .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir even when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press never denied it .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ atter on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to waste me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it in a friendly way - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff Ten@@ dency and the wild desc@@ ents of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ismus will probably say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father made efforts on television to be il@@ loy@@ ally towards his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor was J@@ C told his comrades and parliam@@ ent@@ arians after all the reports on their convention on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron a free ticket to Europe allowing him to support Lab@@ ours &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the refer@@ en@@ al campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite accounting economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of a small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost @-@ cutting of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
statements by a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely wind@@ y basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) model in order to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting announced to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding that he was supposed to receive according to reports previously received by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for the selection of members of the board are not supplied , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes Champions , some of which also provide a sector funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the tobacco line was also attended by p@@ he .
the research work of the group is &quot; indic@@ ative &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; damage to most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well .
however none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have so far been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; served as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
p@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what does not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die from a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clari@@ fying up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ers , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for publicly prosec@@ uting programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent that are clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee as part of his investigation on BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the radio fee , which I think is not a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others don &apos;t do or put on order .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wi@@ dest possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is funding that could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ aire is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ law television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC in general .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series who managed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to back up long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will give back what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart teaching in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ erin should be sold .
Johnson said that the more publicly @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions to justify £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time frame in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testi@@ fied before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that little from BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in the public broad@@ cast@@ ed broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful were shown on television , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems , which can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through the power @-@ on of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
nem@@ ato@@ des usually do not respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells assigned to them , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultras@@ on@@ ically to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which has to be sent to the desired location in the brain by an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works for free with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the tru@@ ce - by a laying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic advertising slogan , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by bur@@ ring with bright colors and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the trade fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Am@@ nesty &apos;s Tom Davi@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture units are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors buy fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old I moved to a student residence , still in the faith of bur@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sni@@ ff : people tell where you come from , where you get sab@@ bath year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like unlike those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were ali@@ ght and those fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , movie night events and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people get dressed and put on their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t forget to start with a relationship at university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship sealing through baking .
since you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people is to introduce yourself to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
badly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people stop sleeping when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student resi@@ dences .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say they use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make a noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , whether it would make them something , drum &amp; bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse was accidentally moving into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be completely aw@@ k@@ ward if you are holding a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , going to them , separating themselves again and seeing them every day and perhaps witness how they all come up with all together friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot fellow @-@ inhabit@@ ant is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk a bit of reason to your abdom@@ en .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good punch is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water which you then put into the freezer - but stap@@ le your possessions on the blanket no more than twice .
travel houses for refugees , single mothers , low ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner relies on a central @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian corner house for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the single mother and the lesser ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build affordable and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being pushed to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes in knowing how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds a housing estate for refugees in a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
in view of the flow of refugees we also need enough housing in the coming decades .
a very tri@@ vial , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terra@@ ced house needs least space . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it makes integration easier .
this is different from sub@@ stit@@ uting people in blocks of housing .
each of the six homes that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building instructions complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have correctly extracted my project . &quot; &quot; &quot;

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it &apos;s ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , because they get an error message telling me that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to b@@ ypass the issue , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean dropping apps to make room - but Apple has made this impro@@ b@@ able by creating the update . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued , as the phone might switch mid @-@ way and this could result in break@@ downs .

bad Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who performed in Bad Kis@@ singen more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which was accepted by President Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players that cannot raise the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wants the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
lod@@ gings Office for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the centre of Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , one can also participate in courses there .
the social foundation desc@@ ends from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing information will receive information on questions such as nursing care or health care insurance .
for years we have established with our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ ef@@ ree family members are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ist and the citizen hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as prevention prevention , memory training or a physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the Senior Centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seen by both business leaders in demographic change .
this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
moreover , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also devoted itself to the standardi@@ zation of old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able gathering . &quot;
thus the social foundation makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturdays from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang died in 92 years
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus shared on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang the Künstler@@ haus will lose an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects in the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the field .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect , but has also worked as a teacher , writer and director .
from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Form@@ ing .
in the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the renovation of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .

Wiese then stor@@ med off the business , insul@@ ted the function@@ ary , and threw her the dist@@ ressing monetary penalty in front of her feet , as reported by the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper .
in the city of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but the consequences for the unusual incident have not yet been clari@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only then will it be decided whether a meadow will be displayed or not .

men beating up on 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now cried out to the young and hit the face with the fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al her@@ nia and bleeding strongly from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the thu@@ g , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to their home and passed there demonstr@@ atively several times .
when the vehicle was no longer seen , the injured one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
with the help of a head@@ stock , one beats on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue item description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and sign@@ ers to contact us at the telephone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over the rest of the field and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this .
doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lacking luck in many places in the country : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of field breaks on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at the side of his successor over the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase Müller opens the practice on October 12th , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the fel@@ lows met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completes their training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and wants to get into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to pursue our own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future was pleasing to the couple Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and guide families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
meanwhile , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller was also raised there , his medical studies in Hanover were followed by stations in several doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed head doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in a voluntary work in the DRC &apos;s prepar@@ edness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon employs Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stand@@ ausen as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( specialist ) has specialised in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as domestic doctors .
&quot; the endos@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the renovation , the rooms will look modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50@@ 000 euros will be given by the refuse holder within the framework of a funding programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ son &apos;s Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients arrive in the field of field breaks , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen .
if no successor would have found herself , she would have gone too .
by the way , those who visit Müll@@ ers consultations always look first and foremost in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their depar@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the doctors have practiced for 30 years there .
&quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ stand@@ ausen , smiling .
after a long time , they feel a bit of melanch@@ oly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband concludes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always pressed myself against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also being driven at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to apply for asylum is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that there is a need for clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , not even the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia has been denied &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously communicated that Slovenia also wanted to leave the incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also establish corri@@ dors for the refugees .
in this way , however , the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already highly controlled as the border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to bend its borders to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby maize fields .
according to local media , police vehicles constantly meet with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is predominantly about Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days his country will be counting about 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which until now had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the Belgrade Government denied that it was the people attacking certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border city S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually mean the predicted shift in the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west@@ erly direction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not refer to details , but he pointed out that Croatia , as a non @-@ Schengen member , had &quot; extensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country since 2007 , as regards the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday morning with a local evi@@ denti@@ ary in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advice migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps showing alternative routes through Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : there are still no cleared min@@ e@@ fields in parts of the border area 20 years after the end of the Croatia War .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a mine clearance team was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have listened to a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of providing insights into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the captured information , insi@@ der shops have been made on the financial markets .
in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SE@@ C announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 more accused continued to take place .
most of the accused come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted out in both the US and Eastern Europe .

the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid pointed out this action to its 20th anniversary and is confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the volunteer workers .
while a pedestrian interven@@ es spontaneously to the chal@@ k and adds &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; read , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; suffer not long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again on the br@@ ink of little discussion about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make it clear that some@@ day the end comes to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic plant Mannheim , which is co @-@ founder of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Foundation together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why this public action is good for the 20 year old .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tables , however , is understandable , after all it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , even though the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of the people .

F@@ ed@@ Ex earnings mixed , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered its profit prospects for a year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell more than 2.5 percent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the fiscal year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 .
the lower level of view comes in spite of the price increases , which are at an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4th , despite higher bo@@ d@@ les for heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted twelve of Z@@ ack Investment Research &apos;s analysts .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex posted a decline in international priority shipping over the past few years , bringing revenue in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in Pre@@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most awaited meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week round a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to lift the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening over them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ stor@@ eyed meeting hall , there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ person Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all the other things .
the Central Bank has a double mission from the Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by unprecedented incentives by the close @-@ to @-@ zero current interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the business data show that it grows solid , recent turbul@@ ences on the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to ampli@@ fy this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and even by a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they watch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do what makes the financial market uns@@ ett@@ ling itself .
about half of econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial average jump@@ ed by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy keeps the set up this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rates would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
still a month ago the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the proposition was expected .
although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets all over the world came together at the end of last month , after China had utilized its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
the market has recovered a little this month , whereby the Dow falls by almost 10 % below the May pole .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation of when interest should be increased .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US National Bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get better control of the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of Ben S. Bern@@ anke , then in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion triggered del@@ u@@ sions around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for the Asset Management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who is committed to increasing interest rates , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited disc@@ er@@ ni@@ ble effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lack@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market re@@ unification , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement at Bank of England .
the recent turbul@@ ences do not come near that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe für Flüchtlinge
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of countless volunteers .
there are also a number of people in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da who support non @-@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with her 74 L@@ ess@@ ons she still likes to teach .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seekers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is quite another lesson than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s Pedi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to sho@@ cking women to clarify how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with images of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build up a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research indicates that a higher intake of calories is not the only dietary adap@@ tion that mothers should perform .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atten@@ ed for the solar system .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited range of gymnas@@ tics on the Bern@@ ese sports grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent joint session , the revised construction application was unanim@@ ously sec@@ und@@ ated without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; before that , the Panel had , among other things , decided on an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was permission for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ existent first and roof over@@ stand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will result in a wonderfully large southern roof &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the roof inclin@@ ation , which for energy reasons - was dict@@ ated differently from the building plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan regarding the roof pitch does not permit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ ese com@@ mon@@ wealth usually drives more restric@@ tively in the case of a liberation motion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Turn@@ halle is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gym@@ nasi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 2.3 million Euros are calculated at the cost .
grants are expected from school and grass@@ roots sports promotion .
in the next stage of the process , the building application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall will be presented to the District Council for review .
the Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented then all the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the remaining In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change was initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this meant a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the field &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer and his team are expected to close both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which still has 35 beds , should finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing rehabilitation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital has been completed .
Land@@ lord J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shut it off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer via the Qu@@ asi parade to Le@@ ch , who was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has not been given a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again in the past decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are required tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) at Berg@@ ischer HC .
although the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season , the bad@@ ener found a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and made something good there .
j@@ agu@@ ars with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the aber@@ ration on a cor@@ n@@ field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police told them .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the Criminal Police Det@@ ects .
16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who have been missing since Saturday .
in Ver@@ hö@@ r , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the youths were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a canal in Rock@@ h@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ h@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police ha@@ sten@@ ed Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , arrested on Tuesday evening , is considered to be susp@@ ects who , according to the fact , with@@ drew the indication and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she hadn &apos;t come back home after a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee told the authorities in the police hearing that killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was supposed to be presented to the Haf@@ ner on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a dead load on him .
the further investigations are intended to shed light on the immediate circumstances of the action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees are looking for affordable housing .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the arriving refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association was commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this means that 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seekers during the first three months of their stay .
many stum@@ ble upon the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers have been living in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also made significant changes in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting down an apartment deficit , which gets bigger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , about 77@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metropol@@ itan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many professionals lived in large cities , penet@@ rated in WG rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults voluntarily stayed longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the noisy crowd on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction .
thus , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended for a limited period of time .
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary according to the alliance .
the support programme for refugees from the state bank Kf@@ W is already well in the case of cities and municipalities .
a good week after the launch , more than half of the currently available 300 million euros had already been retri@@ eved on Monday evening at EUR 18@@ 4 million .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia judge a corridor
there is practically no coming to Hungary , as more and more refugees are choosing the way to Croatia .
Zagreb announced to grant the transit through Slovenia to the North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to travel from there to Western Europe .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary closed its border for refugees on the previous day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day make it virtually unnecessary for decent asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this eventu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police took up the first refugees at the Serbian border with Croatia &apos;s neighbouring country .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to reach Croatia by foot .
at the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , the refugees do not come across border fence .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
according to Hungary , there are hardly any more refugees following the closure of the border .
on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 people .
just before the door closed on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws show the overcoming and damage of the border fence as a crime .
35 proceedings were therefore initiated in Sz@@ eg@@ ed &apos;s southern Hungary border town .
the convic@@ ted are threatened with prison sentences up to five years and the deportation out of the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications have been received on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; established on the border , almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically no one has a view to apply for asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to ti@@ dy up .
they gathered the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side over the past few weeks .
locking grids have been disman@@ tled and one of the recording studios in the border area has been rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express itself about the goal of this conversion .
only a few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
around the 20,000 migrants , according to government data , were still in the country .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities in the morning .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy with the clean up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was finished in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and drew the border together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border to the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we had to dress up the unexpected guests first , with snacks and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him take a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from one ICE to a regional train in direction to Passa@@ u , in order to get there after the announcement that the railway traffic was stopped after Germany , but still to try the border .
the regional train was shut down at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ alised , on the day before a two @-@ b@@ ump @-@ run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án , now sending tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the establishment of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor confirmed the position of the Hungarian government in the mist circuit of National Socialism .
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to realize that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the coming winter to make di@@ gni@@ fied conditions for people seeking protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quar@@ ant@@ ine
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad has to do all his hands with the provision of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up districts for thousands of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen Training Centre has already gotten a grip on Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a big fuss , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ stroke &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the Ministry of the Interior spoke about a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad counts with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quar@@ ts in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 units will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are expected to provide the Länder , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had conversations with the provincial govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ av@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to explain how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum @-@ coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier yesterday critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that neighbour@@ hoods have to keep a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the sky@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , is more successful in placing an accommodation , says Konrad with his experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say in the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood without further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not charge the Republic costs , as they declared themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees by three to four .
so far , the search for qu@@ arti@@ s has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
however , there are apparently problems with the permission .
Linz calls for better distribution
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design center for housing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the suffer@@ ers are currently unable to submit these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability .
critic@@ ising the chief of the city on the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , provincial governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ ded the further procedure in the refugee question .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic remains possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
however , the guards would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now also introducing controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger from the course of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group is moved into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Klein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup @-@ companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from S &amp; T € 1.7 million were invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second business in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
in fact , Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the pi@@ geon @-@ market ar@@ cade : after all , it has now gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , now everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;ve been thinking long if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been brid@@ led by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
for me most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women look into rap@@ ture when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with the last safety .
perhaps it &apos;s because a nice bag of every outfit is enhanced .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called en@@ co@@ ders .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for set @-@ off .
whether it expresses itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , broad@@ cast@@ ed journalists or revealing knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cut it off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fres@@ her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ row@@ er village on the wine route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabitants place are related to him over ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter made an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump and the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big mau@@ l &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in High German : the en@@ co@@ ders , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the en@@ co@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a local store for gold dig@@ gers .
first real estate sales in New York were the corner@@ stone of the real estate group .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home dur@@ ably failed at the Bavarian State , where the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not take Tr@@ ump because he was formerly chew@@ ed without permission , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , was declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican Immig@@ rants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote p@@ ump ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born dr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement regards the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ushing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pension land@@ lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally good .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing in the USA at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would have never arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 film go@@ ers , also in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian Community of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this down@@ side of the bure@@ au did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , since they achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 spectators at the five major cities , with Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today scored a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in recent months , the gap has closed to Sunrise .

at the beginning of the year , the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 .
up to now in September , sunrise has an average of 34@@ ,000 viewers to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ael Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half @-@ hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe economies , yiel@@ ded 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jump@@ ed to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly have who wins The Bachelor .
the woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was envel@@ oped in sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on fel@@ lows , before coming out of three , you might have inad@@ vert@@ ently gave a hint on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a game corrupt who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
je@@ av@@ on fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noted , I felt they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house made it clear last week that Wood &quot; could be the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now set to him un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked , whom Wood should choose , if not she , then she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls in equal measure - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on 10 on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ ka as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League @-@ conver@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne during his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers sports re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his sli@@ pped catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start which Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne dump@@ ed the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get worse in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land parliament fraction conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e .
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free Cho@@ ose Meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as it existed during the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the independent elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for filing for asylum : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W CEO critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would need national uniform standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria shifts , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the policy of Landes@@ poli@@ t in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt is not to fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing favourite is on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Medium @-@ level plus , &quot; in which an extension of the upper secondary school secondary school was tested for three to four years .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 has to be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want to .
free journey to the G@@ 9 wherever you want .
tough@@ er Wall Street helps Da@@ x on le@@ aps
the German stock market has closed down with profits after a long @-@ distance and nervous system of trading .
it was only in the afternoon that a fixed pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock markets ensured a clear direction that promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ Da@@ x increased by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
the euro@@ zone 50 as the leading index of the Eurozone decreased by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid gains were also boo@@ sted by trading stations in London and Paris .
in the US , the Dow Jones Index finally listed around 1 percent in sales .
many stock exchanges reck@@ on that until after the interest decision in the US and for a large decline on the fut@@ ures market , the markets will be replaced on this Friday .
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and left deep traces at E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German energy companies might be missing 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures cited in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
at the top of the roof , Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had a positive effect from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investment in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off .
auto @-@ values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were sold than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt .
the securities of Daimler and BMW increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen virtu@@ es increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
in the German pension market , the return on return on listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police poured rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ exten@@ i District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief District Apostle , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , which are known to be able to kill , are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent confron@@ tations since the age of 10 .
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been ruled centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature expe@@ di@@ ted the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft of Kathmandu this week , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the plot at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city currently prepares everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market a land of approximately 4000 square meters in close proximity to the Old Post Youth Centre .
preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no agreements have been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had already bought part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner of Great Street , just a few months ago and that the building can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement at the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor creates for the first time public plans for the project .
some An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the sale of their Freizei@@ tzentrum
for months it was negotiated behind closed doors , g@@ ag@@ ged , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement are located near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ de company &quot; System @-@ Bau , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ enbach went on the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours .
the project , which is about ten to twelve million euros , has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners who came to the meeting sum@@ mon@@ ed the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea bu@@ ds and board member of the advoc@@ acy group of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant ring that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like many other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole bus loads must come so that this pays off &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on the one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans were still variable .

Google La@@ un@@ ches Dup@@ lication Don@@ ations Campa@@ ign to collect $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ stepped the European nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to the announcement of the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark railway and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing help for refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million will be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has distributed more than 4 million people this year .
many flee from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya destroyed by the war .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial for the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c shr@@ ink@@ age - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabe@@ tic treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the type of diabetes was completely dissolved at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was in total only one percent , and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , &quot; said the leader researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compar@@ es average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the host rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.6 % ) and reported rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone of the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is becoming increasingly important in the literature : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently released novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ lers and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist Guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and pointed out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quad@@ ru@@ ple increase of intake of dis@@ infection products by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 , who swallow a highly alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant , thus Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , cases of in@@ comes of hand dis@@ infection in children under the age of 12 who report toxic control centres climbed from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children intentionally drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
YouTube videos show how teenagers drink dis@@ infection only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have supposedly mixed dis@@ infection products with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child doesn &apos;t think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very attractive for children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
only a few small children can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip around whis@@ ky , but people let these hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently taken four sp@@ lashes from straw@@ berry @-@ sc@@ rub@@ bing disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought to an emergency call for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally in@@ toxic@@ ated by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor treating them at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah all@@ u@@ ded her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of Hir@@ n trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had pushed his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ jah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended its parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths due to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed after hi@@ cc@@ ups of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suggest that the product contains meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which has been recorded as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade were planning to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wei@@ rd &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and banned them from their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; squ@@ ab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and gave disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in case of a rear @-@ end collision at the cross bar between Nordr@@ ing and Her@@ ero , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was injured in a rear @-@ end collision .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the round@@ about in the direction of the industrial area on the cross @-@ column and was too late to see that two forward @-@ looking vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the accident involved vehicles , material damage was caused by approximately 10,000 euros , shares the police with .
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Audi was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

D@@ ons increase lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Ro@@ om@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ season gave Aber@@ deen a brief victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ours about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader .
I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid @-@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch soccer fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic Games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of tension in Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic war has to fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ ings to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent ex@@ iting from the Champions League the defeat was followed by 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen , who are now at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it this way - but we have to go on .
we really need to really support Celtic because it makes the players better .
getting together now is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious on January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , pointing out that he made some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about signing new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ re .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic target person Mich@@ u with reference guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation , has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years and did not manage the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts set on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son comments
the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and lost 3 : 2 but the Red Card of the Defender was later abol@@ ished - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no question of integrity , I have not commented on performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ks
the incor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was re@@ proved after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ k@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Der Stür@@ mer and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ k@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the management team of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things down - but confess that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the guys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ coun@@ tants to see a seventh consecutive league match that brought them a lead of five points ahead of the Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ om@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues that haven &apos;t won games of this sort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is growing overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland has fallen by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drunk bo@@ thered the drain
as security guards could not bring peace , the employees called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody .

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation already took place for the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed .
as the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have phr@@ ased it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ porter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters you can contact for .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .
man after firing police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come out of the c@@ anning river
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist stayed dry when he talked to the man of the C@@ anning River .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called into Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of the C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end the race sport
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult circumstances when it was about the positive cobal@@ t @-@ t@@ amp@@ on test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it went on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had to leave the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this bring me to the opinion that it is going to be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and might make people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people are thinking out there that I am .
maybe they have to take my license and viol@@ ate me , and I have no doubt that what I say is letting them think about it now .
but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been based on the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; t@@ oss his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ folded master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been evening like that .
it could have been like yesterday the whole day , which was so .
but it was also the case on the racing day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes back against ri@@ vals for claims related to ring battles
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy declared critic of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees had allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring struggles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised remark to the Storm Team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he defended the T@@ ack@@ err@@ g of his team and said that they were concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team voice him confi@@ dently , as it means they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team .
&quot; that &apos;s always up to date - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring struggles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tical a real centre of gravity , and this has made the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this occurs repeatedly during this time of the year .
in 2010 , Bell@@ amy had attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a cra@@ p .
but now he has a team that can play and which we consider exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football to play - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play like these .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters earned a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks making and no points anything exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm Team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the Pre @-@ Final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
bier with 200,000 US $ security deposit
a man who could potentially suffer a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to get into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that there could have been a harmless reason in the café .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of a criminal act , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and is holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab pul@@ ls apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening a truck driver was seriously injured .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver found it too late and tried in vain to do@@ dge to the left at the last moment , as the police told them .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident bench broke completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely locked over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2.000 Euro .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to enti@@ ce pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ ophil@@ er used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping ho@@ g .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research , which used terms for finding non @-@ permanent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then Ho@@ gg insi@@ sted that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment to have included in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year on 25 January of this year and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg did not appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the judgement until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was taken up before the date of the judgment into the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
Schle@@ user switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken out of the border control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers made people increasingly close to smaller border cross@@ ings because of fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the river Inn river Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they had reached the German side by foot over bridges and artificial tur@@ rets .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
according to the Federal Police Head@@ quarters , more refugees came from Munich Main Station in comparison to the start of the week on Wednesday .
at 8 : 00 pm , some 700 people arrived in the state capital , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ners of the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn against storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air is currently streaming into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who in the past few days was drawn from the Bermuda Islands via the Atlantic .
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected most of all in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Con@@ stance with arches from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour can be expected .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the mass makes it : every two years the car makers show their innovations at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
in 2015 , it is above all to be seen in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
the compact class cars are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of the new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days September 17 to 27 ) .
this year , a number of new compact models will be presented between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres in the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the trade show .
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive either .
Opel is introducing a start @-@ up below the biggest competitor , VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16@@ 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen also offer other diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible on the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is running the fourth generation of its Astra competitor , Meri@@ da , into the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the trade fair , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mé@@ gan@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be seen as a five @-@ door model in a conventional and sporty GT @-@ version . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he comes to business in the beginning of next year , and then as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment .
in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti blends into the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp is also available .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions for 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .

Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A .
the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger placed the front part on the outside : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and for the first time integrated Apple Car@@ Play .
in addition , the compact class IA@@ A offers a range of over@@ work and new variants , such as the new Mercedes A @-@ Class , or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner to the prison sentence Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judge , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up within a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally absent .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on a free foot@@ ing , was transferred to a larger cell .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , his official position due to the un@@ di@@ gni@@ fied detention conditions against the State of Berlin has failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges took up the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
even if legal reasons for legal reasons were only a few days of detention for compensation , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a wor@@ rying about the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
so they only spoke in April of a det@@ ain@@ ee damage , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , un@@ worthy is also the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had agreed to an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff at that time was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours per day in a similar cell as in the Car@@ ls@@ bad case .
in recent weeks the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines because of lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore surrounded again and again for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness is increasing , even to but@@ chers it should have happened because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of young people , 19 are expected to fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what is coming to Germany ?
according to Deputy Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany , some 800 000 asylum seekers will be able to take up one million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is going on in Germany gives the following overview .
according to various forecasts , it is needed between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing , however , is dramatic , above all for affordable rental objects . 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing projects fall out of the rental price every year , and these particularly favorable dwell@@ ings will also apply for refugees .
for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 redund@@ ancies per year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
in agreement , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation critic@@ ises .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Ge@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , there was a political shift in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work .
whereas previously there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residence requirement imposed on asylum seekers is limited to one place of residence .
in society , also because of the shortage of skilled workers - mostly the view is enforced that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lacking knowledge of German .
to date , there is not yet a sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contact .
for this reason , the construction of networks is , according to the view of the accession of the Königs@@ weg , to the integration of labour .
the Berlin school administration found that only a few escaped parents put their children in the day@@ care centres , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; it is very important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ evo@@ king , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
in order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for teachers to rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes without a welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ afford from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal land prohibited asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception to date was Berlin , sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated by admission to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a residence permit or de@@ ple@@ tion do not receive any services according to the asylum application law more if they begin studying .
the latter basically don &apos;t get a ban as they do not fall under the circle of people entitled to death .
tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , this span shortened to 15 months from 1 January 2016 .
but this financing gap must also be closed , said Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively conc@@ ede to Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association which takes care of the newcom@@ ers .
the rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many areas and to grant certain control possibilities .
this also includes the willingness to take heed of religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , said on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will be a topic of the whole society in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will also change the majority society , reducing discrimination and racism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination point and a general equality law for a decade .
but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U mur@@ derer showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time , and why international agreements such as anti @-@ racism , must become reality in the coming years if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of everyone .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees previously expected , &quot; says Dr Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Man@@ - power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls on all the newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards right away .
provided services could later be attributed to the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to cast so many people with the limited range of services to see the asylum application law .
other than that , doctors mainly make language barriers .
so far , so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are getting po@@ orer informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ters need to be taken over , they demand .
many refugees were also helped by more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treated obstacles , and with the young people it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment .
with some other diseases , German doctors come from their training , but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the lack of doctors is concerned , the refugees may even be allevi@@ ated in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , some of them were even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams once more .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ically ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therap@@ ic Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
the refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU München proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp arrives trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and fears of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , strong trem@@ bling and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can apply for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ical workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract each age group to the fascination of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal thres@@ holds and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on the brick of bun@@ ni@@ es to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current Man@@ e@@ gen@@ esis .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the family &apos;s gift is in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their everyday boy@@ cot@@ t and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometre long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus &apos;s program convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to easily record it .
light@@ ness and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast ought to conquer female hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Prestige also fascin@@ ates with finger tip and artic@@ ulation .
to balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the position of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic among different animal protection organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks at it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are lovingly called , is read by the eyes as far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the top priority : good for the animals .
especially on their zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst looks proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether five or more 200 people , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his performances from 17 to 20 September every day at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is a family day , the prices are reduced at 17 : 00 .
in addition , the animals are open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds the wrong address in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the opposition &apos;s asser@@ tions that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month , they had ki@@ cked him off and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the Spe@@ aker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the affected parliament members that the immunity in Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers of politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and services business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad portfolio of businesses that support businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this sector , based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain .
the great shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd records 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al &apos;s 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , with most of the vulner@@ ability .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s circuit , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a long time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on coming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger imag@@ ines a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m trying to keep the balance and allow the players who need to get a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to advance by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale 3.@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and is driven away from the distant hope of leading the association to its first European cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show , which teaches us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a miserable life ) announced 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of questioning the culture that men are preventing help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that , if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if the isolation is dominant in reality .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the Beau@@ tiful at Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , shining through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching soccer in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to it in any case , even though they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
as an employee of telephone counsel@@ ing explained to me : ... &quot; my role for listening to people who feel de@@ pressed and at home is clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can cope with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that make sense to me when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status on the phone may help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend , with which to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed cou@@ l@@ isse , why don &apos;t take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French champion to the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani achieved a header in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ y@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it wasn &apos;t a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was replaced later in the game against his home team and against the club with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to create 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back at ease , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored another or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team in one of three changes , which last weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First league , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine wing stor@@ mer was referred to as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he entered the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti &apos;s pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense before he passed into Johan Wil@@ and passing nicely into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who stroke Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ cker with nine national players in the field and was a heavy enemy with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field .
but except a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed Kevin Tra@@ pp &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did not offer anything .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes got up , with some false pas@@ sports and bad degrees , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who in no less than five tries left alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a pass by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who turned Di Maria into a shooting , which was defle@@ cted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . in doing so , the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans achieved its sixth place of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had put a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi represented a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core Collec@@ ts $ 2.5 billion by stock sales
the Swiss @-@ based mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is affected by falling raw material prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by a stock sale as part of his huge debt collection plan .
the company Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about $ 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with declining commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn push@@ es demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the London Stock Exchange on the early Wednesday morning .
the share jump@@ ed by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core had announced last week the 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to wipe around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns over a long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms Xi J@@ in@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese president Xi J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and ob@@ serves President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a state dinner after the two leaders have conducted bilateral discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President X@@ is visit will provide the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to design areas of dis@@ agreement construc@@ tively &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; adds the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI , whose visit was initially announced in February , will probably meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and Xi will address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding the alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was apparently a few years ago just before the Com@@ mit@@ ment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four times champi@@ ons League winner , two times club world champion , twice European champion , twice champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already standing before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça was selling me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid at that time won everything we don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he re@@ counts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that also registered FC Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the crucial man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change , that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time in 2008 / 2009 would have gone with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , the reds switched off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated King &apos;s triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , with reference to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in line @-@ up of the film and not during the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow ! okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian began to soli@@ di@@ fy .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a ut@@ te , beaten by her white bree@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ W@@ ING that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tweet earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after teen@@ age Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement was nation@@ ally active and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured people .
in February , singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; albums still matter of matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent years , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News @-@ personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ins invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which concluded its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 foot @-@ long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 by American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deserved it more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so quite suddenly .. as I can not even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and changing life , he receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll get a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad it &apos;s Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
formerly they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb in one half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card room .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories will be fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Out .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained its early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two in@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 sessions and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first triple hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle marine on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ gie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh session , the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ h@@ ander Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the Wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ hand Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe had a double play
when Detroit added a Garden Run at the end of the ninth corner , wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the tiger &apos;s Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ hand @-@ man , however , made S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth S@@ ava .
Detroit benefited at the start of the game by an un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted from the vulner@@ ability list before the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ush gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runner in the sc@@ oring position .
third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers laid out in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit particularly well , but he got the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of an injury to the litter shoulder .
he is being investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries due to shoulder injuries , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is deleted from the vulner@@ ability list to start against T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip since August 20th .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to come to Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who are in it will then be housed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden told on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily be accommod@@ ated there .
they should then be distributed to other communities .
alone over the past ten days , there have been 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse after the presi@@ dency of the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium appointed for the first time .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have emergency shel@@ ters in sport halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the resol@@ ute reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective for@@ esi@@ ght &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington demanded a massive increase of international aid on the spot for refugees .
Austria controls Eastern and Eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there had already been talks about the General Manager for Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call specific numbers and pointed out to talks in Berlin on Wednesday .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers will take on a new start to a binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees on a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening following almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister of the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection complain that too .
but those who do not have a perspective of lead cannot stay in Germany either .
this view was clearly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of strength &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could be locked up with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from crossing over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
according to witnesses reported in Turkey , thousands of migrants headed the way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean oscill@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers conclude from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the moon is easily deceived by its orbit around the ring planet .
this pi@@ geon movement is only small , but nevertheless too big for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it was known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
already in 2006 Cass@@ ini discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called e @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama missing from Munich for several weeks
the 1860 @-@ year @-@ old Munich has to renoun@@ ce Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
an investigation showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury during the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association shared with .
at the beginning of the week , Ram@@ ah compla@@ ined about pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper , looking at the possible commitment of a law@@ less professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties first presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player is supposed to go into running training .

no Di@@ et Fruit - Man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , however , man@@ goes contain plenty of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
for those who eat fruits , they support vision , immune system , and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go , however , gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter flavour of some leaf salads like Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

the US parcel service U@@ PS covers up to 9@@ 5,000 subsidies for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday .
most of all , drivers are looking for .
last year , U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 assistance .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its rival F@@ ed@@ Ex meet earlier in the past year in order to be prepared for the Christmas business .

first fo@@ eh@@ ood , then striking cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alpine side of the F@@ öhn stops , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and at night to Thursday the F@@ öhn blows partly with storm strength through the herd si@@ re .
after fin@@ ishers on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front that brings heavy ra@@ ins , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the forefront of an extensive grav@@ ure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the mountain@@ side , on the night to Wednesday the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys with bends of 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adi@@ cally and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn winds its way up into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n ensures summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow at the slope of the Alps .
here rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , in the next 48 hours , more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be calculated in the south of the Alps , this after a large amount of rain has already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning the blow dryer goes off , in consequence a cold front is rolling with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and temperatures drop significantly .
the following days show up in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the weekend .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther course
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther course in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
at the Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o he is now recognised as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was applied for by the work group of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in secret .
the square is symbol@@ ised in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for several months in Rome .
at that time , he perceived the city as a sin@@ ful sin@@ ful ba@@ bel .
his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him according to historians in his later struggle against Rome .
at that time , Luther had initiated the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his theses against the apost@@ les@@ hip .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures .
at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 designs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , the respective topics are adapted , it can be quite dark .
Ot@@ mar Alt was working on his Bible project for about three years , for which he made a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross @-@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds , or fa@@ therhood .
he has been fascinated by several partners spontaneously : this is true for the Luther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler book with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical texts on the basis of painting .
he interpre@@ ts the Bibli@@ cal passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt thereby transl@@ ating into today &apos;s &quot; contexts . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist who , in this case , formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old thus allows a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; education has already happened with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up this , perhaps to get me back with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art back to more promin@@ ence in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of images is shaped by advertising today , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is sup@@ planted .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; fall in &quot; in the pictures , let them work on themselves , discover and sense what strength they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost said on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but rather chose the mysterious subjects for him .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here we are talking about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot; a picture Bible was created .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bibli@@ cal ) language of love and the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen photos - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway is approaching
plans were made , company mand@@ ated , earth moun@@ ts model@@ ed for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished .
failures in politics and administration ensured food , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new space wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will go down in October , the First Municip@@ ality of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been informed in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga was a clear sign at the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures its help in dealing with the problems facing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle that I can &apos;t do anything , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and would help .
however , the decisive turn@@ out must put forward the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has extended its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have ensured the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach explained at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will bear the im@@ print &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama of refugees passes every one , and no one can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use football , no , we need to use our jet power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Cup qualifying game against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach called for the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big common network of German football &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license societies had launched their own projects in their places was magnificent .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association will jointly present 300@@ ,000 Euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associations have already called for the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of the SAP executive board loses an eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost his left eye with a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a glass of water after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged him out on the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could go back to his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you have fallen away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback issued by Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League final broke .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar Thursday ( 7.@@ 00 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if R@@ eus will be back in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the B@@ V@@ B coach open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high burden on its professionals , Tu@@ k@@ kel will not only change its stem cells on the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change in the door position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of tribe @-@ keeper Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europa League games in the future , however , Tu@@ k@@ kel made it open .
with high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ ceful testimony of fellow player R@@ eus that the final campaign for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal is that mid@@ field players Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to grab the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ bot cars : government wants to lead a pioneering role in Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany will be a technological pioneer in the transformation of the car .
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday to adopt a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in expanding digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t talked to IA@@ A from a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new era of mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states which are also coming together with industry representatives at the IA@@ A .
the strategic paper of the ministry of transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broadband expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communication .
a test track on the 9 Autobahn in Bavaria is currently being tested for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to apply internationally for the fact that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite this , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly explained .
however , the Germans are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday on the AA commissioned by the investig@@ ative organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all in 20 years .
in France , 21 percent of the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es figure up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 per cent in the USA .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey conducted by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey across all roads .
at least 15 percent could be imagined on the motorway , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car to control under no circumstances .

the final decision shall be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bundestag runner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championships in Dus@@ sel@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l was at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the S@@ etz@@ kl@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo fled , and we have become European champi@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the World Ranking List . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he was hiding men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was ble@@ ak in the past , it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer changed his attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in the Canadian Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total art work , for which much effort was done : to fr@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was especially engaged .
the makers have car@@ elessly bar@@ red 14 tons of material according to the dict@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special delic@@ acy : a leder@@ h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashionable attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything but could keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as fashion niche
in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in a large quantity for customers , which they worked on for example in blankets and she@@ ers .
today , this no longer works , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a larger role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion that leans on past styles is an increasing order potential .
those who don &apos;t use niche in the textiles industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en , together with nine other companies , is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been cut off .
private shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach our customers on this path .
today mass @-@ produced goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports weak@@ en , currently to Russia and the US .
so there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
the industry association also seeks to score points through environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer , by the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been running a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
that is why an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball tip .
the machine is sti@@ cking little chi@@ cks in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the issue of P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and want to have a mem@@ ento of souvenirs .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still dar@@ ing a new movie of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is not about a re @-@ adaptation , but a kind of continuation , which takes 20 years after the first film with the magic children &apos;s girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; at the cinema .
XI is ur@@ ging to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
the economy needs to open up to the outside to promote growth , President Xi J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with steering the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi .
the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a legal business environment and making the market more open , &quot; said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also ease controls on the powers transferred to the company and make sure that companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es and to offer consumers a significantly higher dose of the ven@@ om .
the Consumer Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which has issued a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy will be passed on with full impact on pregnant women and small children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sh@@ midt , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish at the end of the food chain .
even today large predat@@ ory fish are so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that around 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the existing limit values .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be uns@@ al@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ le , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller grav@@ ey@@ ard fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the decrease in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction that only helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish through the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts of particularly in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury gets into the environment mainly because of burning coal .
according to a written statement by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants em@@ it more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total quantities issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and extensively exceeded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most common reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
