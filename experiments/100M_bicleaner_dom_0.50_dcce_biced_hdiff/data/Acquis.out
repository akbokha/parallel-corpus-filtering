each State applies to the Organization , including its assets , funds and assets , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials whose duties relate to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives and liber@@ ties of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Agency .
the security measures after this Convention are concluded with respect to core material when the community and the organisation establish that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that is no longer usable for a nuclear activity which is under the viewpoint of the security measures of Bel@@ ang , or has become practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
the community noti@@ fies the organization according to this Convention the transfer of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to the security measures under this Convention .
the security measures in accordance with this Convention shall be terminated with regard to core material as soon as the recipient state , as fores@@ een in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for it .
the organisation carries out documents from which any passing on and , if necessary , the re@@ application of the backup measures to the further core material .
if core material , which is subject to security measures under this Convention , is to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of alloys or ceramics , the community will agree with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures may be terminated following this Convention in relation to this material .
II ) that the candle material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the duration of the non @-@ application of the preventive measures in accordance with this Convention .
B ) The organization and the community shall ensure that the safegu@@ ards envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied as long as the core material is used in such activities .
the provision shall , as far as possible , determine how long and under what circumstances these safegu@@ ards cannot be applied .
in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity .
the organization is kept informed of the total quantity and composition of this material in the respective state or the respective states and about any transfer of such material from this state or these states on the current .
this explains its agreement as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a approval or a secret knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the carrying out of their respective obligations under this Convention .
if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their territorial control , but extraordinary expenses incurred as a result of a special request of the organization , the organisation will reimbur@@ se these costs , provided that it has clari@@ fied beforehand .
the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with their laws and other provisions , to the Organisation and its officials in the same way as to the nationals of the states .
any claim which the community or the state may asser@@ t against the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the community or a state for damages - except for damages arising from a nuclear incident that came into being out of the implementation of the security measures under this Convention , is regulated in accordance with international law .
after examining the relevant information submitted to him by the General Director , the Council shall establish that no core material , which must be subject to security measures under this Convention , shall be bil@@ led for nuclear weapons or other core explo@@ sives , and may also take the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the stat@@ ute and , if necessary , also take the other measures provided .
such steps take into account the Council , in which measures were obtained by the employed safety measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties involved is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security .
on request of the Organization , the Community or a State , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of that Convention .
the Community and States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council encourages the community and the affected state to participate in discussing such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes , an assessment of the Council after Article 19 or a procedure adopted by the Council shall be disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiating path or by another by the Organization , the Community and the States , at the request of a party to submit to an arbit@@ ral tribunal consisting of five arbitr@@ ators .
the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed appoint a fifth who leads the presi@@ dency .
if the Community and the States or the Organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days after the request for an arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may elect the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure shall apply if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within three thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned .
a ) This Agreement applies to non @-@ nuclear weapons states , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the community , in force , i ) when the relevant State of the Organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this agreement and

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure necessary in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I relating to securing measures .
the objective of the security measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of core material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such a degradation by the risk of early detection .
for the sub@@ stitution of the target defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the investigations by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the material quantity devi@@ ated for a certain period is specified , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified amounts .
in carrying out their ex@@ ams , the organization makes full use of the securing system of the Community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and controlling system of the Community for Core Materials pursuant to this Convention is based on a breakdown of material balance zones .
when applying its security measures , the Community will use de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how it is intended and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock quantities ;
( B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of uncertainty ;
( C ) procedures for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and recipients ;
( e ) Proced@@ ure for the evaluation of accumulation of not measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and changes of the stock for each material balance zone including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are performed correctly ;
h ) procedures for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures under this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , described under the letter c ) , divi@@ des the amount and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope accumulation , the plant or the process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced to the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , it is subject to the other measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . however , if the provisions stated in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to precau@@ tionary measures under this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable from resi@@ dues , the organization and the community consult each other on the application of suitable hed@@ ging measures .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
on the request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities pursuant to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to hed@@ ging measures under this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided the total amount of nuclear material released in states is no more than that of this article .
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of particular p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
( II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ stroke square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material , which is subject to the security measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions for the re@@ application of the security measures are taken on that material .
the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which are necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organisation pursuant to this Convention , in individual cases as to how the procedures established in the Convention apply .
the supplementary agreements may be extended or changed without amend@@ ment of the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention in force . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to enable these agreements to come into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
the organization , based on the initial report stated in Article 62 , establishes a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying this Convention despite its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its ex@@ ams .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sources of resources .
C ) The aim of the E@@ EC and the Member States is that all the contributions made by the Member States are bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do their best to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the Organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement .
the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the term &quot; special transaction account &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States shall contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this agreement ; this account is referred to by the Organization as Administrator ) , only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the fees are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest recei@@ v@@ ables of the Member State , which shall be paid upon request in the currency of the respective State on order of the Organization as administrator of the special transaction account and deposited at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) Payment shall be made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the Administrator at the appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other date agreed between the E@@ EC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into account the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every@@ one Member State may , upon request , make payments to the above @-@ mentioned dates .
the bai@@ li@@ ff takes in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization about proportional acts on the cash or the school j@@ ines to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
when granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC :
III ) the extent in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) The composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its other lending capacity to loan terms without discount ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ ir@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is independent of whether it is considered the loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices used for the funds funded by the organization , with the objective of the addition mentioned under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction account may not be used instead of ordinary funding from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or loan , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
in addition to Section 4 , special loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which apply to the development loan granted by the organization in general ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in ten years of release each in 50 years .
special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts for the payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that retains them .
a special loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular .
the revenue from each special transaction loan may be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator defined at the time of the loan granted , may be bene@@ fici@@ ary of a special loan .
re@@ payment of a special loan is made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred from the car@@ et@@ aker to the respective Member State as soon as possible .
the bai@@ li@@ ff will inform the E@@ EC of the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the examination by the directors in preparation and about the plans and programs approved by the directors .
during the time of re@@ payment of the special loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC will inform the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
the bai@@ li@@ ff transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organization , a detailed settlement of the special transaction account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this statement of account .
after full payment of the special loan , the Administrator of the E@@ EC sends a detailed report about the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts to be financed from the account recei@@ pts , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the bai@@ li@@ ff work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the bai@@ li@@ ff up to the full issue of the means of the special action account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programs financed by special action loans , and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date when the E@@ EC and the Organisation agree , the agreement and all obligations resulting from the parties shall fall due immediately .
if the total amount of the capital of all special loans taken by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement has been rep@@ aid and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations resulting from the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural rules of each party .
the governments of the Member States under@@ pin the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat shall forward these noti@@ fications with a Noti@@ fication on the Ord@@ inary Appro@@ val of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organization .

agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements
the BI@@ S could conclude Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make a corresponding request .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the fee paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism , within a total limit of $ 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds from member countries .
however , there are already listed below some conditions for which the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each Stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without being exceeded altogether five years .
in the event of the opening of the loans as well as in the extension of any extension the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws will not be made before the end of one month following the conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the end of the agreement at the disposal , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taken into account under consideration of the Bank &apos;s funds , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those employed by the BI@@ S at the time specified under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the required funds itself on the market , the interest rate used for the application could reach a maximum equivalent to the Li@@ bor which is increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I encourage the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties are agreed :
- Fresh or cooled chicken - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual crowd : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina agrees to ensure that the amount of annual rainf@@ all is not exceeding the agreed amount and is carried out according to the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , the two parties consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the common market has not been touched by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed amounts in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned .
the comm@@ union comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of articles written by this agreement to a rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
with the entry of new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount set by the Argent@@ inian trade to each new Member State under number 2 .
the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the regulations of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of value stated at number 5 .
the total amount stated in number 2 is set to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight with the day of the accession of Greece to the community .
the community under@@ takes all to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed amounts .
in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions so that the sale of frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the provisions of the Ord@@ in@@ ance on the Par@@ agra@@ ph of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community appro@@ ves that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of sheep and lamb as well as slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs takes place only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Articles XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement .
Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement in particular by granting export lic@@ ences specified in this Agreement for the products listed under number 1 .
in its turn , the community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products will be made dependent on the submission of an export license , designated by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government .
the details of the application of this system are stipul@@ ated in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the fra@@ me@@ works can be dispens@@ ed with .
in implementing provisions , it is further stipul@@ ated that the responsible Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the responsible body of the community sends the amounts in regular intervals , for which export licenses have been granted ; these data may , if applicable , be en@@ umer@@ ated in accordance with the country of destination .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
he regularly examines the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of the two parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are of importance to the target mentioned under number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this agreement shall not be affected by the fact that products from h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned tari@@ ff numbers according to the Community .
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising in the implementation of this agreement and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount stated at number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount that is valid from the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is determined in relation to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal nature of trade .
this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would share the consent of your government to this effect .
I honor to confirm the entrance of your present writing with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I encourage the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations the two parties are agreed as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina agrees to ensure that the amount of annual rainf@@ all is not exceeding the agreed amount and is carried out according to the conventional offer forms ( frozen or refriger@@ ated ) .
in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed amounts in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned .
the comm@@ union comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of articles written by this agreement to a rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
with the entry of new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount set by the Argent@@ inian trade to each new Member State under number 2 .
the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the regulations of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of value stated at number 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would share the consent of your government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I encourage you to express my government &apos;s consent with the content of your letter .
with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on traffi@@ cking of sheep , lamb and goat meat
I encourage myself to engage in the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a joint market organisation for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep farming and the export of sheep and lamb to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy are exist@@ ential and that the normal sales of New Zealand @-@ Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected by these markets , I honor to propose the following agreement :
the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled chicken - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this agreement , New Zealand will ensure access to the market of the community in the amount specified in the agreement for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Zealand receives the assurance that the normal he@@ el of its hammer and lamb will not be affected by the application of the regulation .
in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the amount of the annual amount actually performed does not exceed the prescribed amount .
the specified amounts are carried out in the conventional offer forms ( frozen or refriger@@ ated ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from developing new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the community market .
should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , the two parties consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the committee mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community takes the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement .
in the event that imported from New Zealand will not exceed stipul@@ ated quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country .
the comm@@ union comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of the products collected by this agreement to a rate of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
upon accession to new Member States , the community in consultation with New Zealand will am@@ end the amounts set in clause 2 according to the scope of trade in New Zealand with every new Member State .
the import burden for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the regulations of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account in the clause 5 above @-@ mentioned rate of exhaus@@ tion .
the total amount stated in clause 2 is set to 2@@ 45 500 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight with the day of the accession of Greece to the community .
the community under@@ takes all to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the normal sales of New Zealand h@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the common market within the agreed amounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions so that the sale of frozen meat is not under@@ mined due to the implementation of the regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the two parties are doing everything to promote the consumption of sheep in the community without risk for market stability .
taking into account the aims and provisions of this agreement , the Community appro@@ ves that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of sheep and lamb as well as slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs takes place only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products .
new Zealand ensures compliance with the amounts stated in clause 2 in particular because there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .

if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or symptoms may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured double in a suitable medium by repeatedly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is only calculated by volume of the flow of blood cells in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object carriers , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood type determination International Standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are drawn up at the time standards .
according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .

the exp@@ ir@@ ation date on the label for dry re@@ agents depends on the results of the re@@ tain@@ ability studies ; it must be approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ us @-@ pent@@ ane in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the conditions for specific@@ ity and efficacy .

the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to perform the effectiveness tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records on all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood type determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents that have been issued can be stored in the laboratory for a long time , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin only contain substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents may not contain any substances of human origin .
a black @-@ and @-@ white printed label can be attached to each individual container in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,

the transfer of goods linked to the goods traffic between the contracting parties is gro@@ unded by means of a uni@@ forms paper , for which pre @-@ prints are to be used for the samples in Anne@@ x I to this Convention .
depending on the case , the trac@@ ing paper is used as an application or paper for export , shipping or import .
- explicitly requested for the implementation of legal provisions in force in a contracting party whose application would not be guaranteed if the application has been used for the purpose ;
- must be requested by those involved in order for them to come to the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief .
( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved .
( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can in particular indicate that the concerned goods are not to be changed at a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be allowed .
in these cases , an application must subsequently be filed with the consent of the competent authorities for a periodi@@ c collective reservation , within the deadline stated by these authorities .
in the cases of paragraph 1 may be allowed to use instead of the single api@@ ary trading sp@@ api@@ ere .
if the Position Paper is used , the parties concerned can include the ple@@ dged lists in which the goods are described , with the consent of the competent authorities , instead of the supplementary sheets on the in@@ feed paper in the trade customary lists in which the goods are described .
- to mutually exclusive agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of form@@ alities for their entire goods traffic or for sub @-@ sectors ;
- upon consi@@ gn@@ ments that include several types of goods , to provide assistance in the shipping method of store lists instead of the supplementary sheets to a safety paper ;

- allow the competent authorities to request the input of the data required for the provision of the concerned form@@ alities in their data processing systems for the treatment of registr@@ ations , and , if necessary , without submitting a written application ;
- allow the competent authorities in the event of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of registr@@ ations that the export , delivery or import registration can be made either by the trac@@ ing paper created by this system or , if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing plant ;
- to apply facilities which were adopted by the Mi@@ xed Committee in the way of a resolution according to article 11 paragraph 3 .

( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
not@@ withstanding the special provisions relating to collective shipments , the competent authorities can , however , fores@@ ee that the form@@ alities for export and shipping methods are applied to one and the same pre@@ pressure by means of the copies intended for these form@@ alities .
in cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are in agreement as far as possible , that the information contained in the copies of the registration issued in the individual proced@@ ural sections coinci@@ des .
( 1 ) In order to ensure a smooth transport of goods between the parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or violations , the customs authorities of these countries ask each other for or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports )
