this document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package attachment ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ elessly think and speak , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a psych@@ ic illness , in which patients have different episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alternating with periods of normal atmosphere .
abili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for intake or melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole is thought to be a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , works to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents their re@@ occurrence .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms was studied in three studies for up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar illnesses that suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol for 12 weeks , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , compared to that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the symptoms of the patient &apos;s symptoms were investigated using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for taking in .
in the two trials with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients who received placebo .
in four of the five short @-@ term studies , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for taking ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled tick ) , ti@@ rem@@ or ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , bl@@ urred vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( increased sali@@ vation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety states .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mostly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and whose man@@ ic episodes were based on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients aged 65 years has not been proven .
a lower initial dose should be considered with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is set off from the combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in case of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no elevated risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down treatment .
when a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
there were however , in one of these studies , a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system is caution when Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ X remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ites .
taking into account the common administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefit should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ E , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with Abi@@ li@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate rise in Ari@@ pi@@ dic concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ ated ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy due to insufficient data situation for human safety and due to the concerns raised in animal reproductive studies , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was 15.@@ 1 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from o@@ lan@@ t@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,@@ 3 % in patients suffering from hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term endurance period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma cell binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ P recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease in binding of 11@@ C rac@@ co@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the put@@ ty .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the share of response patients , who maintained a response to the study medication , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ Rate Scale show significantly stronger improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l showed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo superior in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period for 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l presented himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , predominantly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ meth@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l , N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination season is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l in extensive metabol@@ ites of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study schiz@@ ophren@@ ia does not show gender dependent effects .
a specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans , so that they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ depend@@ ant adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10@@ x average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
moreover , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the G@@ alle of apes in the study for 39 weeks and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a daily maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing of Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can take the melting tablets alternatively to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the start or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in case of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
weight gain is generally observed in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment should be continued with the same dose to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l .

man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ P recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l were compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ x of the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
abili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by b@@ yp@@ assing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given according to the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for conservation or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with infectious and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ ery and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ ps , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to the one after all the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers were used intra@@ muscular ( 15 mg dosage ) as dispos@@ able intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and who received at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites , in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ E , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ d@@ se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that after all the administration of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l .
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side @-@ effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term endurance period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements in ag@@ gregation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms regarding ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
mean improvement of bas@@ eline scores on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ bra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe a@@ gi@@ bility , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the population population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the share of response patients , who maintained a response to the study medication , was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current readings from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate showed significantly stronger improvement than in hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l presented himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reg@@ ression , predominantly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C was 90 % greater than the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , average time to achieve maximum plasma levels was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration of systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were between 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies of reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans ; thus , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equ@@ als 3 to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
moreover , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ ti@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ times the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was investigated in a main study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
if only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between drug efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration in disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other metastatic breast cancer treatments showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who are nursing or before the treatment has low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given to other drugs to reduce side effects in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel supplements .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the Abra@@ x@@ ane company Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abram @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who failed to show first @-@ line metastatic disease and did not show a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy type 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until improvement is reached in degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see Section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been performed with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impaired ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel that could show considerably other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and symptom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in the patients no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not un@@ common , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case of nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients following the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive remedies .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable method of contrac@@ eption during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not give birth to a child for up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised against a sperm conservation before treatment since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane has the possibility of ir@@ reversible un@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) that can affect traffic and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ es@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pains , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inal tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscular sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in the skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , back pain , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in connection with a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ ul@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active agent that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the course of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ant receptor and because of the alb@@ um@@ bing protein aci@@ dic line in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation occurs in the tumor area .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ obstruc@@ ted trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a 3 @-@ week mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abram &apos;s 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and for adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression free survival and progression @-@ free survival for patients who receive first @-@ line therapy are shown below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity towards pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement in a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure exposure level ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Acc@@ ording to the intraven@@ ous administration of Abram &apos;s patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates extensive extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly distribution and / or exposure to pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study of patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with the intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute injection of 260 mg / m2 abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) following a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in people with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative loss of active substance was 4 % of the total total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , there are only a few data available about patients over the age of 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light protected for more than 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potential toxic substances , be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion fluid is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute ( 0.@@ 9 % ) .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the penetration bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the penetration bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and gently and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until a complete reset of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itations or sm@@ el@@ ting substances are visible , the penetration bottle has to be inver@@ ted gently once again in order to achieve a complete reset in front of the application .
the exact total dose of 5 mg / ml of suspension required for the patient is calculated and the appropriate amount of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

member states must ensure that the holder of the approval for the placing on the market provides the medical specialist in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials before market launch :
• Training brochure - summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing examples . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , cold boxes for transport through the patient are provided .
this means that ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also known as the &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood don@@ or is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his super@@ visor as long as they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron levels of all patients must be monitored prior to the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an@@ thro@@ po@@ ic deficiency , or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby dimin@@ ish the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was brought in , which enables them to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a V@@ ene in a main study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered an an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems compared to the reference drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein at least eight weeks before they either switched to ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were investigated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who have been converted to ab@@ le@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that according to the rules of the European Union Ab@@ se@@ amed showed that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that makes ab@@ se@@ amed is providing information packages for medical professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the placing of ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union .
treating an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of the trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion exists due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large blood volume substitute ( 4 or more units blood in women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
the reduction of foreign blood Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is to be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml can be applied which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except pedi@@ atric patients in which hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease by the physician is required .
a rise in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels may occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
considering this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be made to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest permitted dose , which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the clinical results suggest that patients with an initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with an initial low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ a@@ emia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease by the physician is required .
considering this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be made to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied at the lowest permitted dose , which is required for the control of an@@ emia .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has risen by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the optic disc number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline , the dose should be 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reprodu@@ ci@@ ble cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l have risen from bas@@ eline , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the optic disc number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has risen by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reprodu@@ ci@@ ble cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to bas@@ eline , response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery .
the iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available before the start of the ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg on 10 consecutive days before , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to ins@@ ure the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients suffering from the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin at an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive ab@@ se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) .
cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina ( ang@@ ina ) , increased risk of deep vein occ@@ lu@@ sion ( e.g. ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ lies ) .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or ca@@ vern@@ ous diseases : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of active effect , defined as a reduction in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the reprodu@@ ci@@ ble value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ flu@@ idi@@ zing ( ic@@ e- , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ mag@@ in@@ toxic@@ ation , infections or infections , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value is low ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit from epo@@ et@@ ines when ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically controlled coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumor patients under chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be considered for assessing the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ic @-@ related an@@ emia ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the start of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying car@@ dio @-@ vascular disease .
in addition , it is not possible to exclude that an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vas@@ cul@@ arity occurred in the treatment of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or to reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
when epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ em@@ ic , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , ar@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin therapy , as well as patients suffering from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin therapy , patients with cardiovascular disease can come to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetically obtained epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ated and , in terms of the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ em@@ ic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate compared to controls compared with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after a repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis ) is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be traced back to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 in animal studies with approximately 20@@ times the recommended weekly dose epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa resulted in reduced financial aid , to delay the os@@ ensi@@ fication and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports stem in vitro findings with cells originating from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

the owner of the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application is established and functional before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the medicine brought into circulation is applied .
the Data Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) outlined in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) outlined in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. and subsequent update of the Risk Management Plan pursuant to Article 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the Marketing Plan .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be filed : • In the event of receipt of new information , the impact on the current safety specifications ( safety specification ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures could have occurred • within 60 days of reaching an important milestone ( the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) Acc@@ ording to the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or intensified breast pain ) , there is a risk of coron@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis in the veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) , for example , if there has been such a coron@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , for example .
in severe blood circulation disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you have recently suffered a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , there can be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which can be rec@@ eded with further treatment .
your doctor may also perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solving of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 , or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before starting the therapy .
very rare was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ te after months to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin injection ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ con@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of hei@@ gh@@ tened or increasing levels of potassium , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values lie back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically apparent coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion mark by inadequate heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al failure ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your red blood dy@@ e values ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your ab@@ se@@ amed dose to minimize the risk of coron@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if there are already th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurring in the past ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are cancer patient , remember that ab@@ se@@ amed acts as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative effect on the tumour .
if you are planning to undergo a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the treatment begins .
if your blood values ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get ab@@ se@@ amed since there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have used / used other medicines or used them recently , even if they are not prescription drugs .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may also arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means of building up the immune system , for example for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you get regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equal @-@ sized inj@@ ections .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure ab@@ se@@ amed even under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vascular infections ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin therapy .
eye li@@ ds and lips ( quin@@ ce ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special Bew@@ are when using ab@@ se@@ amed is necessary &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can be - irrespective of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - to a drop of blood ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used for the treatment of the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic stress frac@@ ture like the H@@ inf@@ in ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days after the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Pa@@ get Mor@@ bus , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ ich@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a has been used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was studied for a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years ago , who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was studied for a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two trials in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with the Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % over bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of cycl@@ ine frac@@ tures in patients suffering from Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the placebo .
compared to all patients suffering from Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to cit@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other component .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion area and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( the death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides clari@@ fication material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications as to how the medicine is to be used , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should turn to the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited approval for the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic ac@@ etab@@ ular frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The package insert • Con@@ tract @-@ indication in pregnancy and in breast @-@ feeding women • Re@@ quired for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing aid
oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic ac@@ etab@@ ular frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic ac@@ etab@@ ular frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic ac@@ up@@ un@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by adding acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended since limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data on safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the fast sett@@ ling of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to have sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients need@@ ing dental interventions , no data is available if the inter@@ ruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for each patient &apos;s treatment plan and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol can be reduced by adding acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of adverse event reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which expressed itself as decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ atine Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and limited ren@@ al function were similar in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ ins within 10 days of application was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal range of patients ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received supplementary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent frac@@ ture frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study were reported via local reactions to the fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been controlled , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ o@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including cit@@ ric acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures .
7 trial involving 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area of a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in the case of an over@@ dose leading to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , the administration of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ ur dog ≤ 1.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric vor@@ tex frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures after a year ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduction in the risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta had a lasting effect over three years , which reduced the risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase of the lum@@ bar spine of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ oral neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es taken from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ comp@@ uted tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volumes and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture in patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type @-@ I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below bas@@ eline value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below bas@@ eline value for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below bas@@ eline value for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total dose was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at all times .
over a period of 24 months , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and 4.3 % on the fem@@ oral neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in untreated males compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ weekly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change of lum@@ bar @-@ lum@@ bar BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged more than 30 years with radi@@ ologically verified , mainly light to moderate morph@@ ine Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with the 2.7 to 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to taking 30@@ mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to the bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α -@@ 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long phase of elimination with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h irrespective of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely as chlor@@ ogen@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient populations ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the cit@@ ric acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance , and was in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 g / min ) .
the result is that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder until a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance down to 35 ml / min does not require any c@@ anned adaptation of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
since only limited data are available for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ current intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are six times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without any ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with IV application , the ren@@ al tolerance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was determined by intraven@@ ous doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure relative to AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions that exceed the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects were observed in other organs including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most frequent occurrence in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medic@@ aments , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is to be disclosed , which could affect the current information on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached . • At the request of the E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a class of substance known as bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens , made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by normal@@ ising the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forces the bone again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are being treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you take or apply other medicines , even if they are not prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , please be aware that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have enough liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
as Ac@@ la@@ sta does work for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood are not too low in the time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta can work more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , contact your doctor or hospital promptly to arrange a new appointment .
before you finish the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta if you are considering the termination of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next visit to the doctor and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions , however , less frequent .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscular or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
it is unclear at the moment whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms as you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around your mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported primarily in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects does adver@@ sely affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic ac@@ etab@@ ular frac@@ ture it is recommended to carry out the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
due to the fast sett@@ ling of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic @-@ running hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia can develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic ac@@ etab@@ ular frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise to treat adult patients who suffer from obesity ( body mass index @-@ BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and also one or more I
there were also four studies carried out in over 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used in comparison to placebo as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting smoking .
studies on setting up smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia on this application was difficult to estimate .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia that were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is recommended while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HIV infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight cuts
medicines used in patients who need it from health and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing information packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the AR@@ Z
it is an addition to diet and exercise to treat obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorder , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in an individual case out@@ weigh the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who - in addition to obesity - do not show any visible risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other close relatives must point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in treating patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke , etc . ) were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant less than 6 months ago .

let us examine overweight patients as well as patients with obesity and in addition to 3@@ 800 patients in further indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients treated for weight loss and associated metabolic diseases .
if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significantly higher than the corresponding placebo ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ desirable effects &lt; 1 % ) . NG When evaluating side effects , the following frequencies are summari@@ zed :
very common ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasional ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very good
only slight symptoms were observed in a case study in which a limited number of individuals were administered up to 300 mg .
patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hypertension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
n weight reduction after one year , for A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg . 6.5 kg , relative to bas@@ eline , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ comp@@ lia 20 mg and 1,2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.@@ 8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4.4 , -@@ 3.3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
after 2 years the difference in weight loss between A@@ comp@@ lia and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
9 weight reduction and other risk factors In studies in patients without diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with diabetes
under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average drop of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( initial value tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 %
in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo for both groups .
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference in mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
improving the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were caused by direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and approximately 50 % explained by weight reduction . n eim AR@@ Z
the steady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ MA@@ x = 196 ± 28@@ ,@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ U = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g.@@ h / ml ) .
influence of food : he subjects who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in in@@ timi@@ dating condition or after a fat @-@ rich meal , had a 67 % higher C@@ MA@@ x or 48 % increased NG AU@@ C in case of food supply .
patients with black skin color may have a reduction of up to 31 % lower C@@ MA@@ X and 43 % lower AL@@ C than patients of other ethnic populations .
n popul@@ ation@@ sp@@ ha@@ ine@@ tic analysis ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ MA@@ x and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old .
5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of these adverse events that were not observed in clinical trials , but those found in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area were considered to be potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some cases , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seems to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals .
as Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a long period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which permitted a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycle disturbances .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant resulted in uter@@ o and by lac@@ tation no changes in learning behaviour or memory .

summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine .
ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was investigated in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered when applying doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos on the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea was 0.@@ 94 % in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values , while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a lowering of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos also showed a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who received placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ology ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one mirrors - acid levels in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the marketing of Ac@@ tos across the European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , rounded and carry on one side the markings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficiently regulated with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bilities ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 18 no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. early cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserves .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased starting liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzymes must be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , the liver enzymes must be checked .
the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are presented .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can stem from fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of the mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients suffering from met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or as a two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ an , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an appearance or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescription physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological diagnosis should be considered .
in a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or occurs , the treatment can be cancelled ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one dimin@@ ishes the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated in this data ) .
these lead to a temporary modification of the tur@@ g@@ or and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed also in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T asc@@ ents sur@@ ged three times the upper limit of the normal range , as under placebo , but more rarely than in comparable groups of met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin .
in an outcome study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one res@@ ides .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure among pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups treated with comparative medication .
in the trial period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have activated the activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose classification in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for more than two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first six months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of the therapy a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin in spite of three months of optimization were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients suffering from pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients receiving insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 weeks study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L cholesterol level as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced overall plasma levels and free fatty acids as compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ ze and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to placebo no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while values declined under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid .
in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the in@@ timi@@ dating tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ fla@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both over an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride ad@@ sorption and also the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized in groups that received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral use , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma usually reach 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to its effectiveness is approximately three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ IV is minimal .
in interaction studies , it has shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after an oral use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the fur ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ elimination life of unchanged pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated dosing of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased rates of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) were induced by the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ thic samples led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study for two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zid were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the in@@ timi@@ dating tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ fla@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both over an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride ad@@ sorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which indicated that the blood sugar levels were similar to that of another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may have an effect on the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package attachment ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S an approval for the placement of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day when a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms can be changed and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding thickness , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required in case of a change to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change .
some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or otherwise than their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore consider possible interactions with the therapy and always ask his patients for other drugs taken from them .

diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juices . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving loss of consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an experienced hel@@ per or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum period is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire duration amounts to up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid resp@@ . delayed absorption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S an approval for the placement of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of quickly acting insulin must first be wound up , then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent greater surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ous Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id induced nor@@ mo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( glucose 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.@@ 6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum period is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the whole duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out k@@ not ( &quot; stones &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still higher than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months there may still be g@@ out attacks , so it is recommended that patients receive additional medicines for preventing g@@ out attacks at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine to treat hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood was below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who received 120 mg once a day , received a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to plaque formation ( including one from the medical history known or currently available g@@ out no@@ des and / or arthritis ) .
if the acid levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function impairment ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents , since there is no experience in children and adolescents , is not recommended to use F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ ts , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ acid @-@ burning medicines , acute g@@ out attacks can occur during the treatment process , because the reduction in serum levels of serum can initially be used to mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. with malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far increases that it comes to a deposit in the urine tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical studies showed slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function before the start of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and in the subsequent course depending on clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was did not conduct any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine levels ( an inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg 2 times a day with an increase in f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis ( C@@ MA@@ X 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid , which contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a reduction in C@@ MA@@ X by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy Data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not cause side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistical significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be found .
the risk factors identified in these patients were ar@@ teri@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic and / or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects , which could appear in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical studies no severe rash or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term extension studies have been treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years , and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in the Phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients years ) , according to the data occasionally .

the effective mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and arises in the context of the reaction cas@@ cade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin - ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is an effective , non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) inhibit@@ or with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro @-@ escap@@ ement lying below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical trial results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at beginning of study &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

serum pole serum levels of &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and kept permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with reduced kidney function The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum levels in patients regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum levels ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( A@@ PE@@ X and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum di@@ ure@@ tic acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data of Phase 3 open extension study showed that prolonged reduction in serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ utter node , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the g@@ out no@@ des until month 24 .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ W / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to dosing simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dos@@ e- proportion@@ ate increase .
after ing@@ es@@ tion of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum levels was observed , provided that this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein connection of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration @-@ width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ cos@@ ms , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as un@@ altered f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion through the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ altered f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cos@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups of kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ y ⋅ yr @-@ ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g ⋅ yr @-@ ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not change significantly in comparison to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impairment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly d@@ osed treated group , with about 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4 @-@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions that were about 4,@@ 3 times and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not produce ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical studies no severe rash or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
in the open long @-@ term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years , and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that indicates that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system , such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge ( blo@@ ated stomach ) , and aci@@ dic up@@ take .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be used .
it must not be used in the case of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us diseases , in patients with hypo@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 the European Commission granted the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. a permit for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white until broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of in@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after getting up the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cus , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , be given under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ov@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by malign@@ ant stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the physician should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malign@@ ant reactions , and patients should be advised to consult the drug in case of symptoms of an op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious adverse side effects seems to be elevated in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue to use it after symptoms that indicate a nasty irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cers , including some serious and complications , were reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment arms contain predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available that provide clu@@ es as to whether bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment in patients requiring a lower jaw surgery reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the treating physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken together in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without any clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis diagnos@@ es were also reported .
nevertheless , the serum levels of serum levels up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were similar in both treatment groups .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence of oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ thy@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ mia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .
the therapeutic equi@@ valence of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , BM@@ D &apos;s moderate asc@@ ents with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate were 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % at the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ al and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
compared to the placebo group , the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at decreased by 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % versus placebo 6,@@ 2 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D has continued to retain the BM@@ D of the spine and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate &apos;s daily administration reduced the appearance of at least one new cycl@@ one correction by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15,@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to any clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly circul@@ ated into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
after IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ eces .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and systemic clearance not exceeded 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs by these transport systems .
resor@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) , according to the administration of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before eating a meal , the average surface area below the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( excluding endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) .
the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ X ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an@@ age until the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) was 12 hours .
in the liver , vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy in the liver and met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D@@ 3 , the bi@@ ologically active form .
secre@@ tion In the administration of radioactive @-@ marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects , the average elimination of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the f@@ eces after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted by kidney or liver in order to prevent the transplan@@ ted organ from being rejected by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereas the use of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in whom the transplan@@ t was rejected after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter follow @-@ up studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t have been carried out and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is taken up in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious if other ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken with Adv@@ agra@@ f at the same time as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should associate this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ dose induced immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dose ; Modification of the formulation or regime should only be performed under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
Adv@@ agra@@ f dosage should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus chapter levels should be checked prior to the change@@ over and over two weeks after change@@ over .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both vene@@ er and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night ran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the condition of the patient does not allow oral dosage in the first postoperative period , the intraven@@ ous Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate can be initiated to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application For the suppression of gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further c@@ anned adaptation may be required later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - When converting Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules should be converted to one once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , this change has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
after a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection must commen@@ ce .
heart transplan@@ ts In adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning .
although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and bow@@ el transplan@@ ted patients , Pro@@ gra@@ f was administered in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day in patients with transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
c@@ anned adaptation in special patient populations patients with restricted liver function To maintain blood tal@@ lies in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular assessment of the serum cre@@ atine level , a calculation of the level of the cre@@ atine and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advised caution ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of tal@@ low in whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases using full @-@ blood @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ king @-@ Levels .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ talk levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be checked after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while using substances which might change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may need several days until the steady state has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of blood levels in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the blood cells of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in the case of cardi@@ oid and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which may occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under or over exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dose ; Modification of the formulation or regime should only be made under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and gra@@ ft recipients in childhood , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea there is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , pro@@ gra@@ f was referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy called v@@ entri@@ cular or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infection , over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , lac@@ tose , special care is required for patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ lac@@ tose @-@ mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ E can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( blood levels ) with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain consistent levels ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with anti@@ fung@@ al drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ po@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the elevated oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with medicines , which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ E , whose metabolism impacts .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the exposure to hormon@@ al exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious in decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life time .
the results of a low number of transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effects profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants can often be determined not exactly because of the patient &apos;s disease and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
the following side effects are listed according to their incidence in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases such as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus which frequently increase suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ k@@ otic , proto@@ zo@@ ale ) .
cases of the BK @-@ Virus associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , including treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors related to the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were reported .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed .
effective mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On a molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus could be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection within the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymp@@ ho@@ id genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has evolved into a recognised primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ tations .
175 patients undergoing transplan@@ t surgery in 4@@ 75 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases were used as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large studies where Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in in 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
in the first year after the transplan@@ t , chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was less common ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in contrast to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) , patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % of ob@@ liter@@ ans .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
Pank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was conducted to 205 patients , who simultaneously underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation , which were random@@ ised using Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( by protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired level of seb@@ um from 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following intestinal transplan@@ tations showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the dis@@ connected group of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of the metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ t .
this indicates that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before the ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the elimination is mainly done via the bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley level during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infection , over@@ load and ede@@ ma .

Adv@@ ise is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital heart defect caused by the deficiency of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ise is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ a is similar to another drug approved in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges and surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ant@@ ages in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic iso@@ des was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ise ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ates must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG an approval for the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the Factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impairment are removed .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment course , an appropriate determination of factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
in response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients may differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ life times .
3 Pre@@ vention for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures need to be considered .
the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) versus Factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II . Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk of the first 20 ex@@ positions is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , re@@ occurring ( low @-@ grade ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s in the majority of patients were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ der occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15 postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE on 145 children and adults 2 with more difficult to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 expos@@ ures with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE .
in addition , a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was found in none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and a diagnosis of severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) following previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated patients with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE treated inhibit@@ ors versus Factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated protein was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for the activated factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were performed on previously treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited was officially announced to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for authorisation for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissue ( tissue that connects and supports other structures within the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus which has been genetically engineered to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce any copies of itself and therefore does not cause any infection in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumour and thus allow cancer cells to re@@ generate normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene that is not broken in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and for killing the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer in the lower abdom@@ en , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
in the opinion of the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
moreover , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( blocked nose ) , are cleared .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the trial , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when considering all kinds of hay fever symptoms , besides con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
when only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients demonstrated an allevi@@ ation of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , mouth dry , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to per@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under 12 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine may decrease with time during long @-@ term use .
after swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy as needed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
as the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after such treatment .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ oline , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ g@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tives which can be used per@@ oral or nas@@ ally as ab@@ err@@ atic Rhin@@ ologi@@ cs ( phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ haz@@ oline etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data are not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are insufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment must be reduced in case of hypertension or a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache ) .
• Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise inhi@@ bit positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to scale .
in the course of clinical trials with dis@@ co@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not block in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate is nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to frequency in the normal population .
as reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , a@@ ero should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness that can result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings .
headache , anxiety , difficult Mik@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ dial pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is especially likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - dil@@ ator , skin ery@@ thema , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ im@@ etic effects , such as increasing blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years of age took part with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , whereas 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , significantly higher than under mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by means of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city affili@@ ation .
as part of an individual dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can be detected within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow @-@ equilibrium of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were poor in metabolism .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance System described in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application is well established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergies rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases under the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • hypertension • Cardi@@ ac disease , pal@@ pit@@ ations • Cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • nausea and headache , or a strengthening of existing headaches .
if you take Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
when used in the recommended dosage , it is not expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze results in di@@ zz@@ iness or decreases attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in good time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will neg@@ atively affect you or you will notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulties , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscular pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children aged six to 11 years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergies rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by determining the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the th@@ under , sleeping and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe .
in case of an allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us showed an average decrease in the symptom score ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria the decline in symptoms was after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n , or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of an allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and can be terminated following the end of the symptoms and resum@@ ed in their re@@ occurrence .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be advised that in very rare cases it may result in di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily , compared to those treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most frequent side effect was headache , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) .
this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesi@@ on molecule P @-@ Selec@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was reported as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be classified into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown from the total score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as representative for other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of the eti@@ ology of the different forms , is similar and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited .
since the hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in addition to the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of d@@ ots at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ co@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced sleep and wak@@ efulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following daily use of per@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out completely .
in @-@ vi@@ vo non @-@ C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7,5 mg , meals ( fatty , high @-@ cal@@ orie breakfasts ) did not affect the availability of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a comparable degree to the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support treatment of an infectious Rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to exclusion from upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher substance load ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze limited , is identical to that in children that metabol@@ ise normally .
this drug contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ lac@@ tose @-@ absorption or a su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in the course of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup Group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us compared to those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years of age , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , received an average daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo noted .
at a single daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets performed in adults and adolescents in clinical trials to no impairment of psych@@ om@@ otor functions .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither increased alcohol @-@ induced impairment nor increased drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown from the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of d@@ ots at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited @-@ metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant compound cum@@ ulation after daily use of disinf@@ chlor@@ ate adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In several individual dose studies , the C@@ MA@@ X and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup is offered in type III Bra@@ ung@@ la@@ bottles with a child @-@ safe polypropylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in the course of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily , compared to those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
in two separate dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was reported as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used for 14 days a day for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. daily , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a 17 individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray is removed without damaging them .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was equal and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets turned out to be bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at for the im@@ pregn@@ ation formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was similar to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients aged 2 to 11 ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent in single dose crossover trials of A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , in conjunction with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of per@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are limited to met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing , is identical to that of children that are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of a fru@@ c@@ tos@@ e- intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ lac@@ tose @-@ absorption or a su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in infants aged between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) , and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg dis@@ co@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
the recommended doses were similar to the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) in the Children &apos;s and Ad@@ ult Population .

Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced to the CH@@ MP Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company will withdraw its application for the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that is to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from human to human because humans have not built up immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after the vaccine is passed , the immune system recognis@@ es the part of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this stem .
subsequently the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) , was puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years who are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to take in , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ gener@@ ase should only be decre@@ ed if the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus being addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between the ages of four and twelve , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
as@@ gener@@ ase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood when used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
aids cannot cure AIDS , but can delay damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which was reinforced with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to use prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load changes after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few responded to treatment by the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the study of adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r had a stronger viral load after four weeks than in patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase should also not be used in patients who use St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are degra@@ ded just like as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other drugs against HIV there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected individuals and children treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors out@@ weigh the risks over four years .
as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefit of am@@ using in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally authorised under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unusual circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited to appro@@ ve a@@ generations in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
A@@ gener@@ ase should usually be given to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters combined with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram is not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the increased addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ ase should not be given concur@@ r@@ ently with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates in the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be reminded that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generally , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre@@ existing restricted liver function , including chronic hepatitis , show an increased frequency of h@@ ep@@ atic dys@@ functions under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects including C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of am@@ using with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients who use these drugs at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is also given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r at the same time , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ pi@@ ate , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other illnesses associated with the treatment of medications associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug depend@@ ant factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) may develop inflammatory reactions to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) were reported .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given concur@@ r@@ ently with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates in the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are predominantly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , un@@ desirable effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
when a patient already uses Johannis@@ kraut , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % degra@@ ded when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , close mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the attached component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and available limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may lower the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is advisable because Del@@ a@@ virus might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
if these medicines are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ phy@@ tic , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic trials with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole at 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma led to 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after 200@@ mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole .
other medicines listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may also interact with as@@ gener@@ ase if they are used together with as@@ gener@@ ase .
the patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with a@@ eri@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advised that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it may result in resor@@ ption disrup@@ tions .
simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enz@@ ym@@ atic duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , an@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of am@@ using with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels while ad@@ minist@@ ering a@@ generations are expected .
since plasma level increases in these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors lead to my@@ opathy , including rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it is recommended more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ ising the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while the addition of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase should not be used along with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate possible increase in Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma level by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ pi@@ ate , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adjust the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ phy@@ tic , enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International Standard ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in conjunction with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to human breast milk .
a reproductive study involving gravi@@ d rats , which was administered from the ni@@ p@@ ples in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of offspring , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not impaired by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on the mother &apos;s animal .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ generations was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to the treatment break .
many of these events have not clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other drug used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ DE@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ DE@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) evaluated by investig@@ ators as associated with the study medication and which occurred in more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and fa@@ ec@@ al sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervical fat accumulation .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not treated subjects treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / ci@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( strokes ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study Pro@@ AB 300@@ 6 , in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients at In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moder@@ ately distinct , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ cu@@ le nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually disappeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) may develop inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients treated with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient can observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures must be initiated .

the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients not previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those found in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred more than 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 5@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data and it is recommended to always draw up current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that market diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data about cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients , in which a F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus @-@ containing schema failed ( one of these showed resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment and another against animal @-@ bla@@ z@@ avi@@ r ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , sauna quin@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early termination of a se@@ eding therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the trial PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which pre@@ treated adults received either A@@ gener@@ ase ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ bor@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ d@@ osed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the Study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis noted the non @-@ sub@@ ordination of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ submission threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of whom 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , the A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day , 20 mg / kg twice a day and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no d@@ osed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s that were administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ generations should be considered in therapy optimisation in children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the medium duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was imp@@ acted by the intake of food , although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be locked into the tissue by means of a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood stream .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , is likely to remain unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ E or form a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are simultaneously given with fer@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily ammon@@ ia exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained twice daily after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r without simultaneous rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administration .
long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats occurred in male animals using ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages that spoke to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of the human exposure , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the orig@@ ination of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular Aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests , mice lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations tests on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
so far no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of a@@ generations nor by the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated with age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , were observed , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus spru@@ ce and minor skel@@ etal changes that indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the increased addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with weak or mild liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug depend@@ ant factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of ri@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily .
dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , close mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these medicines are used together , caution is advised ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ phy@@ tic , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , an@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ am@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of test subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ phy@@ tic , enhanced control of the IN@@ R ( International Standard ised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or more .
this drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproductive study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the ni@@ p@@ ples in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ generations was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient can observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures must be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ ming concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ generations should be considered in therapy optimisation in children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .

toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated with age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results indicate that in juven@@ ile the metabolism methods are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking in is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion was not proven either in patients treated with PI or with PI previously treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram is not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution for taking the capsules ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking into patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
concur@@ rent administration may lead to competitive blocking of the drug &apos;s metabolism and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be reminded that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of trans@@ mitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
as@@ gener@@ ase should be set for duration if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r leading to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ X when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with a@@ eri@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and lead to associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , vision disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on the data on 54 different C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking in may not be used during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ co@@ l ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to human breast milk .
a reproductive study involving gravi@@ d rats , which was administered from the con@@ no@@ p@@ ation into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of a@@ generations was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other drug used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early termination of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ generations should be considered in therapy optimisation in children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be locked into the tissue by a large Vet@@ ant@@ aneous volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood stream .

the application frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • Al@@ dar@@ a can be applied five times a week for a maximum of 16 weeks . • With small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied five times a week for six weeks .
before bed@@ time , the cream can be applied dil@@ uted to the affected areas of the skin so that it stays on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed away .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the agent ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo had to be carried out either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
• In all trials , al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete cure rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in the placebo @-@ treated patients showed a complete cure rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p of immuno@@ competent adults if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or accept@@ ability of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream will continue for a long time until all visible pa@@ edi@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the treated les@@ ions were cured only in@@ completely after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient must apply the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then proceed with the usual treatment plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and puri@@ fied in the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case with a stri@@ k@@ texture leading to circumc@@ ision was observed .
an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , serious local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed in rare cases , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have caused temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the discharge of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
prior to the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous administered agents for the treatment of external ti@@ lt in the genital and peri@@ anal@@ ges@@ ic area , no clinical experience has yet occurred .
although data is limited to an increased rate of pa@@ edi@@ atric conduc@@ tion in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown less efficacy in this group of patients concerning the elimination of the crop .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm to the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or the hair@@ line has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions develop after completion of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary because of the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin around 12 weeks after the treatment is finished .
as there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be considered in super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tumours .
data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7,@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower likel@@ ihood of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lips .
there are only very limited data on the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical spots outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support effectiveness in this application , so such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial shows that patients with more than 8 les@@ ions showed a lower total cure rate than in patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Creme should be applied with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies do not cause direct or indirect detri@@ mental effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth , or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable level of serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) quanti@@ fied after several topical application , no recommendation can be given during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects in trials involving three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in relation to side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study reported side @-@ effects listed below .
the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream in relation to side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects indicated by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis are listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs proposed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cr@@ ème it was frequently applied to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / fla@@ king ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs proposed according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cr@@ ème it was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe formation and tasting ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials to investigate the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was observed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most severe side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been detected based on the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the war@@ ts in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior .
patients who had been treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od healed completely at 60 % of all patients who had been treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ; this was the case at 20 % of the patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five mal@@ treatment per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data obtained from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a coherent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % for patients with clinical settlement after one or two treatment periods ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications of external ti@@ lt , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week treatment for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when used in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the estimated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od resor@@ ption after topical application to MC @-@ ill skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months for the der@@ mal application showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not show tumours in the application area .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption out of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tumours appeared in the group of mice treated with the substance @-@ free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people even if these have the same symptoms as you do . − If any of the listed side effects you neg@@ atively affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

if your skin responds too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
a lower number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infection ; it can cause you to create a blue stain sooner or result in a better result .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will neg@@ atively affect you or you will notice side effects that are not indicated in this information .
in addition , you can experience it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
usually these are lighter skin reactions , which end up within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment begins .
occasionally some patients notice changes in the location of the application ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ring , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements complic@@ ate , decreased lung capacity , heart and eye disease .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with recovery equipment , and patients may require appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study examined the safety of the drug , but its efficacy was measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma lowered the concentrations of G@@ AG in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged more than five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion place .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be known and update this summary if necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma manufactures patients who receive al@@ ert@@ az@@ y@@ ma with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ on cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma is indicated for long @-@ term enz@@ ym@@ atic treatment in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in single steps .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side @-@ effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting , in which recovery facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
as a result of the phase III clinical trial , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected to form normally within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions have to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer period of inter@@ ruption , caution must be taken care of due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the in@@ fusion begins with medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ ren@@ ka ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the pre@@ operative response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , which include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
as there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to the larv@@ ae of the mother &apos;s milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma .
adverse events in clinical studies were mostly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase III study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 and up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it occurred within 3 months from the onset of the treatment to a serum version , with a more severe follow @-@ up in patients aged less than 5 years ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until early retirement from the study ) , no det@@ ectable antibodies were present in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients who had never come to the server version .
patients with a low antibody level showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG level in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ des a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine could be determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for enzyme replacement therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and taken up by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement in lung function and c@@ ess@@ ability presented in the following table .
the open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further proportion@@ ately to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ atine ) was observed , which remained constant up to the end of the study .
as a result of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( an expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute range , range of motion of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe follow @-@ up form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe exp@@ ir@@ ation there were limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule of 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ off administration , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any particular hazard to humans .
since no toler@@ ability studies were performed , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except the ones listed below 6.@@ 6 .

the holder of the approval for the placing on the market has completed the following programme of studies within the given time , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which cle@@ aves certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount , or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion stage ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you take medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription medicines .
instructions for handling - th@@ inning and application The concentrate for the preparation of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors or medical staff ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory still@@ ness and facial ede@@ ma .
very common ( occurrence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • skin rash • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • increased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine for cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given to c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an anti @-@ em@@ etic drug may be added before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood type changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , stopped or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form occurs more easily in canc@@ erous cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine for cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared with doc@@ et@@ axel compared with 7.@@ 9 months .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells showed longer survival times when using A@@ lim@@ ta compared with the comparative medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. .
each diar@@ rhe@@ a bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the required volume of the necessary dose is taken from the tube and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma , except in cases of epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancer , except in the majority of epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed application as well as on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the duration of treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood @-@ image should be created before each application including differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose @-@ examination must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking into consideration the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood pattern or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients have to be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria comply with the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ F@@ 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value prior to treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ tions@@ . 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at age 65 years or above , there is an increased side @-@ risk risk compared to patients aged 65 years old .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ by limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically examined in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone @-@ level immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ rop@@ hic capacity has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ uter@@ ine toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees of 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia were added when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients who have been treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed have to be instructed to apply fol@@ ate and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measures to reduce toxic toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) need to avoid simultaneous in@@ gest@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ va cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g a day ) for at least 2 days before the treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days prior to therapy , day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , in patients with a clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion will be considered before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 severe cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials involving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasional when administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic compound .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since there is the possibility of ir@@ reversible deterioration of reproductive capacity by means of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the procedure of treatment to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) can result in reduced ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is therefore recommended if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy calls for an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Bre@@ ast R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy , unless necessary and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since there is the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity by means of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects of the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the incidence and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and which were random@@ ised to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , which were random@@ ized to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fung@@ al that ex@@ erts its effect by breaking important metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti@@ torture with multiple attack points by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ yn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ at@@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis by thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .

primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received test medication in the arm of treatment ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ ea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) versus the single c@@ is@@ plac@@ er arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted in improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a decrease in lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open Phase III study with doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy achieved medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separate random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ sub@@ ordination of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination towards gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Total population a statistical significant for non @-@ sub@@ ordination , with an overall confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ submission limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , patients selected the administration of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.2 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as a mono@@ therapeu@@ tics were investigated in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ ones over a period of 10 minutes .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is mainly left unchanged in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found within 24 hours of use unchanged in the urine .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 L / min and the half @-@ life time in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 100 mg powder for the preparation of a concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg powder for the production of a concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion solution
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients without previous chemotherapy used to treat the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural am@@ o@@ theli@@ oma ( malign@@ ant melan@@ oma of the ri@@ b ) in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of cancers .
if you have kidney disease or had one earlier , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital pharmacy , since you may not be allowed to obtain A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
you will be carried out before any in@@ fusion blood tests ; it checks if your kidney and liver function is sufficient and if you have enough blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may change the dose or stop the treatment as long as it requires your general condition and if your blood levels are too low .
if you also get c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you receive the necessary medicines to prevent vom@@ iting before and after the c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
if you have a liquid collection around your lungs , your doctor can decide to remove this liquid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
if you wish to give birth to a child during the treatment or in the first 6 months after the treatment , please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
drug interactions Tell your doctor if you are taking medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) , such as those that are called &quot; non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ cians &quot; ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) , including medicines that are not prescription ( like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) .
depending on the planned da@@ - tum of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your ren@@ al function , your doctor will tell you which other drugs you can take , and when .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescribed for prescription drugs .
a hospital pharmacy , nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with sterile 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you .
your doctor will prescri@@ be you cor@@ tis@@ one tablets ( equivalent to 4 m@@ g. of dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ son twice a day ) , which you need to take the day before , during and day after the application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
your doctor will admini@@ ster fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) for taking or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain fo@@ lic acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) , which you must take while using A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA a daily .
in the week before application of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and approximately every 9 weeks ( according to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) you will also receive an injection of vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this means that it has been reported of at least 1 of 10 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this means that it reports from at least 1 of 100 patients , but less than 1 of 10 patients have been reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a side effect is described as &quot; occasionally , &quot; this indicates that it has been reported from at least 1 of 1,000 but less than 1 of 100 patients . if a side effect is described as &quot; rare , &quot; this means that it has been reported from at least 1 of 10,000 but less than 1 of 1,000 patients .
fever or infection ( frequent ) : if you have a body temperature of 38 ° C or about it , swe@@ ating or have other signs of infection ( because you may then have fewer white blood cells than normal , which is very common ) .
if you feel tired or weak , get into short@@ ness of breath or look pale ( because you might have less hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in than normal , which is very common ) .
if you notice a bleeding of the g@@ ums , nose or mouth or any other bleeding that does not come to a stand@@ still , or have a red@@ dish or pink urine or unexpected bru@@ ising ( because you might have less blood plat@@ el@@ ets than normal , which is very common ) .

dissolve the contents of 100 mg / ml of sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) of sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , which results in a resolution of approximately 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .

the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ation ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who are taking All@@ i and are unable to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the diet , causing about a quarter of the fats being supplied with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients receiving All@@ i 60 mg achieved an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stool duct , stu@@ d@@ berry rang , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , departure o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( barrels ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term malaria absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or on ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women and breast@@ feeding mothers .
the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited in July 2007 for the placing of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight loss of adults with overweight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ isches , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
as or@@ list@@ at is resor@@ bed only minimal , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for older patients and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.6 ) • Chol@@ est@@ ase • Pre@@ gn@@ ancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ as ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or a fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic may need to be adjusted .
patients taking al@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ related measures in order to prevent the possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international standard ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at up to 4 full years in clinical trials , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , it should be recommended to use a complementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see Section 4.4 ) .
following the administration of a one @-@ time dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect detri@@ mental effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the incidence of known adverse events reported after the roll@@ out of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 m@@ g. three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal overweight and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
most of the reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing reported either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid return of any systemic effects caused by the non @-@ inhibit@@ ing properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bon@@ dage to the active Ser@@ in @-@ remainder of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ ati@@ cal lips .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight loss was observed in both studies over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
mean change in L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not measured 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and detected in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study of obes@@ e patients , with a minimum dose of systemic resor@@ ption , two major metabol@@ ites , i.e. M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ Form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans .

all@@ i is used for weight loss and is used for overweight adults aged 18 and over with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
BM@@ I helps you determine if you have a normal weight or overweight in relation to your height .
even if these diseases do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should still ask your doctor for a follow @-@ up examination .
for each 2 kg body weight , which you lose as part of a diet , you can lose an additional kil@@ ogram by means of all@@ i .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used for organ transplan@@ ts , in severe rheumatoid arthritis and severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines which have a blood @-@ th@@ inning effect .
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of or@@ ally @-@ increasing means of contrac@@ eption ( pill ) may be weakened or repe@@ aled when you have strong diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) .
before taking all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one for the treatment of heart rhythm disorders .
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and • if you take medicines for high blood pressure , as possibly the dosage needs to be adjusted .
to find out how to set your cal@@ orie and fet@@ al boundaries , see More helpful information on the blue pages in section 6 .
if you om@@ it a meal or do not contain a meal , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you are taking the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional accompanying symptoms ( see Section 4 ) .
to get used to the new eating habits , start before taking first capsules with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ reduced diet .
food di@@ aries are effective because you can understand what you eat , how much you eat and will likely be easier to change your eating habits .
to safely reach your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• P@@ ick gre@@ asy to reduce the likel@@ ihood of nutritional con@@ com@@ it@@ ant symptoms ( see Section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor beforehand if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active while taking and after ending the intake of all@@ i .
• all@@ i may not be taken more than 6 months . • If you cannot determine any reduction of your weight after twelve weeks of use of all@@ i , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
• You may need to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not about changing the diet just in the short term and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , do not take a capsule .
flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without o@@ ily ex@@ iting , sudden or increased stu@@ ds and soft fa@@ eces are due to the mode of action ( see Section 1 ) .

effects on blood tests It is not known how often these effects occur . • In@@ cre@@ ase certain liver enzymes - effects on blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients who use war@@ far@@ in or other anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory ( anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory ) drugs .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will neg@@ atively affect you or you will notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after treatment commen@@ ce , as you may have not yet consistently reduced the fat percentage in the diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ise nutritional accompanying symptoms : • Begin a few days , or better a week , before taking the capsules with a reduced fat diet . • L@@ earn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you to exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial counter@@ top as you may have done in other programs for weight loss . • Most people in which these con@@ com@@ it@@ ant phenomena occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store it in@@ accessible for children . • Do not store all@@ i after the exp@@ iry date specified on the cart@@ on . • Ke@@ ep tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • Bot@@ tle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
• Do not swallow it in any case . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) that is attached to this package .

Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional administration of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since there is not enough information on the effects in this age group .
this means that the active agent inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi had no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting showed 81 % of the patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 out of 18@@ 9 ) , 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 out of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
al@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severely em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in exc@@ essively em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids received before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ estic obstruc@@ tions or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to a further chem@@ o@@ therapeutic application Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used either for prevention or for nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity directed against tumours of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics studied ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ex concentration of or@@ als met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience of using pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events ( 6@@ 33 patients ) were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least be related to Alo@@ xi , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ st@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
the group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of adverse events as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ drug interactions .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective treatment with a al@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that was given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m ² c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were compared with patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron per day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and repression and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of I.@@ V. administered pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After IV administration following an initial decrease of plasma concentrations there is a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous injection of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular carcin@@ oma was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that the total score ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to that measured after a one @-@ off intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the single dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the is@@ o@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ gram / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt injection in healthy subjects , the total body &apos;s office was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only by ex@@ positions that are considered sufficient above the maximum human@@ oid exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies there are indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .
the holder of this approval for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for placing the drug approved within the framework of this decision .

June 2006 a negative report approved by the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) in which the approval of approval for the use of the Al@@ ph@@ e@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ e@@ ans should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug @-@ like ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also known as the &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ e@@ ans should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue has damages , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ neur@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally are increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) is brought in to stimulate the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ ead presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ e@@ ans was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug in 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided by CH@@ MP to announce the approval for placing on the market ?
in addition , concerns have been given to the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ ead and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical trials .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ e@@ ans , the disease was more common in more patients than with the reference drug ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ ead had more side effects .
in addition to this , the test used in the study investig@@ ates the question of the extent to which the medicine triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanying with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ mary ( cra@@ cking or cutting wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to be used for the treatment of infections , which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lins @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because it may not affect these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients less than 18 years , the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking bacterial det@@ oxi@@ fication ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the treatment ended .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected house @-@ dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in house @-@ wound , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it has been established that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( protein filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissues ) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the surface of the surface .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , infected small inc@@ iner@@ ations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment must be carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection may be begun .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to be used for the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of retin@@ ob@@ in@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical use on abra@@ ded skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ imp@@ ed skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients Dos@@ is@@ adjustments are not considered necessary if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding implications for the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported adverse drug induced fertility was at the administration point of approximately 1 % of patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the bacter@@ i@@ ally ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal creation of active 50s @-@ ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should experts seek advice on the basis of the local pre@@ valence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some forms of infection , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to respond to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied on a daily basis under occ@@ lu@@ sion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion on humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ imp@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the retina in@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP .
metabol@@ isms The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ isation of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ cos@@ ms was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , below low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo @-@ investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats show signs of restricted fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in an exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ated skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats , ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development sto@@ cking ( reduced body weight of fo@@ etus and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity have been determined .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose @-@ existing vacc@@ ination plan , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be completed .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contributing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vacc@@ ination that has been approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination that has been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , adults and tw@@ o@@ ys are given children as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination schedule .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain adult identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ul@@ ts were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix ran between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month gap between inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the European Commission in August 2002 .
the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ming with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses , the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a boo@@ ster vacc@@ ination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combined vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels are based on the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent persons , who have responded to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination , need a re@@ fres@@ her vacc@@ ination as protection , since they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , in the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the injection of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the norm@@ alization scheme with the combined vaccine is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA elements of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody level after pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required .
since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal immune defect , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting as it may result in ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in these cases .
Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time combined with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it has to be assumed that there is no adequate immune response .
in a clinical trial which was carried out with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ omer and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s compatibility was compared with the combination of 3 cans .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fu@@ tility on a calculation basis for each vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
after the administration of Ambi@@ rix , pain was observed in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects following the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ doses @-@ combination @-@ vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had received the Ambi@@ rix were suffering pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ernity was comparable to pro @-@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ cans combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was similar to that observed with the 3 @-@ cans @-@ combination @-@ vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per tape , was reported .
the share of vacc@@ ines reported about serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis B and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted for vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was valuable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with a combined vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were at the time of pri@@ ming between 12 and 15 years , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccine scheme .
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to those found following vacc@@ ination of 3 cans with a combination @-@ vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA elements of form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study aged 12 to including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 month vaccine scheme compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 month vaccine scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the boo@@ ster of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us flu vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current wor@@ ding in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ - and ser@@ o- conversion rates similar to the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
pursuant to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the stat@@ ute of state charge is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other means such as bathing in polluted waters .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 cans .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the two vacc@@ ines have been administered ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to have quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ alin @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection before the vacc@@ ination series ends .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected into people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child undergo a ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis / sub@@ tract .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child take more medicine ( including those that you can get without prescri@@ bing ) or if you / your child has recently been vacc@@ inated / has been given / has been given or this is planned in the near future .
however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if a different vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be ino@@ cul@@ ated in separate areas and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix is not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is urgently required that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ often ( more than 1 case per 10 sp@@ lic@@ ed cans ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the inser@@ tion point or redness • Mat@@ ching • Rei@@ ten@@ ability • headaches • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 sp@@ lic@@ ed cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Di@@ zz@@ iness • Di@@ ges@@ tive gastro@@ intestinal ail@@ ments
other side effects that have been reported very rarely , days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 eaten doses ) are reported :
these include loc@@ alized or extended precip@@ itation which can be it@@ ching or blo@@ ated , swelling of the eye contours and the face , t@@ res@@ ome breath or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure loss and un@@ consciousness .

23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child adver@@ sely affects or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which have been known since the initial approval for the placing on the market , CH@@ MP assumed that the benefits @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic only in one Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre @-@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - split into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ sis ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do drug , i.e. without active substance ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or flavor release , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with ure@@ a cycle interfer@@ es with high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ al values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unusual circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine was present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use if there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ yn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency should receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing as there is a risk of the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cers if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure and associated with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat are done through the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve les@@ ions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate medication , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose case occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an un@@ inten@@ tional single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound which con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; therefore phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with ure@@ a cycle disorders can be assumed to be produced for each gram of mon@@ oso@@ dium glut@@ amine between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g. of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ est , and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or their sti@@ cking @-@ free analo@@ gues .
through ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nit@@ rous ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first months of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is known to be oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis following item and repeated discharge of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were measured 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate can be detected in the plasma in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disturbances or hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single cans ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts .
secre@@ tion The drug is secre@@ ted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
after the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no adverse effects in rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot yet swallow tablets , or have patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ sis or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins within the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , les@@ ions were found in the pyramid cells of the brain cor@@ tex .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate medication , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; therefore phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is suitable as an alternative carrier to ex@@ crete waste
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is produced for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g. of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral sol@@ itary dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were measured 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
during the duration of the shelf life the patient can keep the finished product un@@ matched for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring sco@@ op is 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins .
if carried out with laboratory tests , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during breast@@ feeding , as the medicine may pass into breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headaches , fla@@ vor@@ ing disorders , reduction of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency reception of your hospital in order to initiate a corresponding treatment .
if you miss the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood pattern ( red blood cells , white blood cells , plat@@ el@@ ets ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention ( swelling ) , taste disturbances , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant odo@@ urs , weight gain and abnormal lab results .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will neg@@ atively affect you or you will notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the box and the container &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usable up to &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
30 If laboratory tests are carried out with you , tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on the same single doses or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ulate out of the container . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon equ@@ als a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of measuring spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate out of the container .
Angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for instance in case of unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stem @-@ lift &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if Angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that undergo a PCI exam , a higher dose is given and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with all@@ u@@ vial administration or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
the PCI often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube which stays in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ ritu@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , Angi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year .
in patients undergoing a PCI , Angi@@ ox was just as effective in terms of all indicators as he@@ par@@ in , except in severe bleeding , where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
Angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components .
it must also not be used in patients who have recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a cardiac infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox in the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the Company , The Medic@@ ines Company , UK Ltd , for the placing of angi@@ ox@@ ins in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST attack inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous stu@@ b of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if the patient is subsequently PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dosage of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours .
just before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous stu@@ b of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a sole bol@@ us @-@ administration of Angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI interference is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is reduced to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt will be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT levels , re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the stu@@ b dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT atta@@ ches to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al impairment ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine against AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , a second take dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al damage which were included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which was admitted for approval , the ACT atta@@ ches 5 minutes after the application of the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
treatment with Angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular lifting .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • Active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible co@@ agulation disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of blood tests on ar@@ teri@@ al pun@@ cture points occur in PCI patients among Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may in principle have bleeding disorders throughout the treatment .
in patients treated with war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine again reaches the level existing prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored .
the experimental investigations are insufficient in terms of impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth , or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ validation group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding , such as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY serious hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point compartment , which requires radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding post , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI study .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparative groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are group@@ ed according to system organ@@ classes in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosage , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately broken down and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ography contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bi inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to both the cataly@@ tic center and the ani@@ on@@ lin@@ n region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ine , and hence its effect , is reversible since Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ine .
moreover , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din was not able to indu@@ ce a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy volunteers and patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
in the case of a PCI study , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST raising inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or on the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography in 72 hours , were equally distributed over the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in table 10 .
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ally ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or unable to process insulin .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from acting insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes in adults with Type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin void .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after 6 months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal wall .
because of the reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with reduced liver function .
any change in the effect of the action , the brand ( producer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in the insulin requirement .
3 A insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion of treatment , especially in patients with an insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing a patient to a different type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia treatment depends on the effective profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , disc@@ opath@@ ies , fi@@ br@@ ates , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation can be allevi@@ ated or absent from the effect of li@@ poly@@ ure@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ dine , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine .
there were no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin inj@@ ures into human breast milk , but generally insulin does not enter the breast milk nor is resor@@ bed to oral treatment .
listed below are listed , sorted by system organ@@ classes and ordered according to declining frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated ) .
cold @-@ wel@@ d@@ iness , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive stress , headaches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is neglected to continually change the injection site within the injection area , and may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a correspon@@ d@@ ingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glucose to be treated by a physician .
after a risk of agon@@ izing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the active time is shorter than with normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 , insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dose of proportion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ a @-@ lowering effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant metering range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 e / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and gains the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a similar post @-@ pran@@ ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with a human insulin acting insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin was taken in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ fla@@ gr@@ ated check was achieved than with the normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control like in the normal insulin acting 2 Mi@@ - gro@@ oves in front of the meal is achieved ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at application 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to the normal insulin which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to the normal insulin acting 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at application 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal in comparison to the normal insulin analog , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
