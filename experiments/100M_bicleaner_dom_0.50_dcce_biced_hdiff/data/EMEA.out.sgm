<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report (EPAR) in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the package attachment (also part of the EPAR) or consult your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirelessly think and speak, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disorder, a psychic illness, in which patients have different episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternating with periods of normal atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for fast control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for intake or melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other drugs at the same time as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters," "" "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripibrazole is thought to be a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripitizol such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters, works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripitizol helps to normalize the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents their reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar illnesses that suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol for 12 weeks, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased restlessness, compared to that of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the symptoms of the patient's symptoms were investigated using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for taking in.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In four of the five short-term studies, Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also reduced more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled tick), tiremor (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (increased salivation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety states.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disruption as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke mostly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes of treatment with Aripiprazole were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and whose manic episodes were based on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness of doses above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients aged 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">A lower initial dose should be considered with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 is set off from the combination therapy, the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in case of treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no elevated risk of suicide with Aripitizol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripitizol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break down treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">When a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripitizol should be used with caution in patients with seizures in anamnesis or at states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripitizol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripitizol had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There were however, in one of these studies, a study of fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events with Aripitizol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical anti-psychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydips, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in patients with schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">The primary effect of Aripitizol on the central nervous system is caution when Aripitizol is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripibrazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripitizol by 107% while the CMAX remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripibrazole compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">Taking into account the common administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefit should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3E, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before starting the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate rise in Aripidic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripitizol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextromethylated).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripitizol.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used during pregnancy due to insufficient data situation for human safety and due to the concerns raised in animal reproductive studies, unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripitizol has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripitizol a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripitizol treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study for 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was 15.1% in patients treated with Aripitizol and 15.1% in patients suffering from olantine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients suffering from Aripibrazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients suffering from haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripitizol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term endurance period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripibrazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripitizol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripitizol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events related to an anti-psychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripitizol alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripitizol, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripitizol has a high plasma cell binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripipezol in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HTP receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripitizol showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease in binding of 11C raccod, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and at the putty.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripitizol showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the share of response patients, who maintained a response to the study medication, was similar in both groups (Aripitizol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery-DepressionsRate Scale show significantly stronger improvement than in haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripitizol showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripitizol showed a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripipezol showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripitizol showed a placebo superior in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripitizol also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania like lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum, the adjuvant therapy with Aripitizol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period for 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripitizol during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripitizol presented himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar regression, predominantly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxymethylation of Aripitizol, N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination season is approximately 75 hours for Aripitizol in extensive metabolites of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as in a pharmacokinetic study schizophrenia does not show gender dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences regarding ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetic of Aripibrazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">Pharmacokinetic properties of Aripibrazole and Dehydro-Aripitizol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripibozole and Dehydro-Aripitizol, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety macology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure in humans, so that they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependant adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10x average steady state exposure (AUC) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">Moreover, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripitizol in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81x of the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of Hydroxy- Aripitizol found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the Galle of apes in the study for 39 weeks and lie far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the 3- and 11x of the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by bypassing adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given according to the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for conservation or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripitizol, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripitizol injection solution in patients with infectious and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripitizol injection solution, patients should be observed with extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripitizol injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripitizol should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celery and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports about dyskinesia occurring during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydips, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in relation to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to the one after all the administration of Aripitizol, in a study in which healthy volunteers were used intramuscular (15 mg dosage) as disposable intramuscularly and who received at the same time Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripibrazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites, in comparison to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolites, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripibrazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3E, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before starting the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedsedation was greater compared to that after all the administration of Aripitizol.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripitizol injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side-effects (*) in clinical trials (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripibrazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripibrazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term endurance period over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripitizol treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripitizol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes of the routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphhokinase), generally transient and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripitizol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events related to an anti-psychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders were the Aripitizol injection solution with statistically significantly greater improvements in aggregation / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggregation and behavioural disorders, the Aripitizol injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding aggregation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">Mean improvement of baseline scores on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripibrazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agibility, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the population population, but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripitizol (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the share of response patients, who maintained a response to the study medication, was similar in both groups (Aripitizol 77% (oral) and haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current readings from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate showed significantly stronger improvement than in haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripitizol (oral) showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripibozol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapine-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients achieved a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study about 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum, the adjuvant therapy with Aripitizol showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripitizol during a stabilisation phase before randomisation, Aripitizol presented himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar regression, predominantly in the prevention of a return to the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripitizol AUC was 90% greater than the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, average time to achieve maximum plasma levels was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripitizol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration of systemic exposure (AUC), which were between 15- and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies of reproductive toxicity following intravenous application there were no safety-relevant concerns after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripitizol (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure of humans; thus, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (Lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equals 3 to 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Moreover, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulfate-conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripitizol in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of the 3 and 11-times the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was investigated in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other drugs to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to treatment compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If only the patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time, there was no difference between drug efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration in disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other metastatic breast cancer treatments showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who are nursing or before the treatment has low neutrophils in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) noted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel and that it does not have to be given to other drugs to reduce side effects in contrast to other paclitaxel supplements.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted authorisation to the Abraxane company Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abram-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who failed to show first-line metastatic disease and did not show a standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane treatment, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy type 3, treatment is to be interrupted until improvement is reached in degrees 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles, the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see Section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies have been performed with patients with impaired renal function and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impaired renal function (see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel that could show considerably other pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the patients no new Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neutrophils rose again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the platelet number rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunction (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">Whereas a clearly associated cardiotoxicity was not proven in connection with Abraxane, cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not uncommon, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In case of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients following the application of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constiptive remedies.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable method of contraception during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not give birth to a child for up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised against a sperm conservation before treatment since the treatment with Abraxane has the possibility of irreversible unfertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (frequent) that can affect traffic and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated in pivotal phase III trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported at 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); very rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10); very rare (≥ 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatinine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, painful gums, loose stool, oessophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pains, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinal tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of musculature, neck pain, groin pain, muscular spasms, pain in the skeletal musculature, back pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in connection with a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal relationship with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimulotubules active agent that promotes the accumulation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the course of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuminant receptor and because of the albumbing protein acidic line in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the tumor area.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unobstructed trials and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given an infusion for 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, which received a 3-week monotherapy with paclitaxel in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abram's 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without pre-medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and for adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression free survival and progression-free survival for patients who receive first-line therapy are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity towards paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement in a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy to decay on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute fusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure exposure level (AUC) increased linear from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml, analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 According to the intravenous administration of Abram's patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates extensive extravascularly distribution and / or exposure to paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study of patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared with the intravenous 30-minute injection of 260 mg / m2 abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) following a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in people with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative loss of active substance was 4% of the total total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, there are only a few data available about patients over the age of 75, since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light light protected for more than 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="327">After complete encore of the solution, the penetration bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the penetration bottle should be swivelled slowly and gently and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes until a complete reset of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitations or smelting substances are visible, the penetration bottle has to be inverted gently once again in order to achieve a complete reset in front of the application.</seg>

<seg id="357">Member states must ensure that the holder of the approval for the placing on the market provides the medical specialist in dialysis centres and retail pharmacies with the following information and materials before market launch:</seg>
<seg id="358">• Training brochure - summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labeling and packing examples. • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product, cold boxes for transport through the patient are provided.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that abseamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same ingredient (also known as the "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood transfusion, if a blood donor is not possible before the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, abseamed is to be injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervisor as long as they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin levels should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron levels of all patients must be monitored prior to the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists, and iron supplements should be given during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by anthropoic deficiency, or that the body does not respond adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby diminish the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was brought in, which enables them to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to a Vene in a main study with 479 patients who suffered an anaemia caused by kidney problems compared to the reference drug.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein at least eight weeks before they either switched to abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in haemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of abseamed under the skin were investigated with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems, haemoglobin values of patients who have been converted to ableamed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that according to the rules of the European Union Abseamed showed that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that makes abseamed is providing information packages for medical professionals across all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co. kg for the placing of abseamed throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treating anaemia and reduction of the transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion exists due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia in the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8.1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or inadequate, in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large blood volume substitute (4 or more units blood in women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">The reduction of foreign blood Abseamed can be applied before a large elective orthopaedic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml can be applied which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l) except pediatric patients in which hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and total disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease by the physician is required.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in hemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin levels may occasionally be observed in a patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Considering this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be made to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest permitted dose, which is required for the control of anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with an initial low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with an initial low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which the initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anaemia and subsequent symptoms may vary depending on age, gender and total disease burden; therefore, the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease by the physician is required.</seg>
<seg id="396">Considering this haemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be made to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is applied at the lowest permitted dose, which is required for the control of anemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the haemoglobin value has risen by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the optic disc number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to baseline, the dose should be 150 I.U. / kg three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reproducible cyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl have risen from baseline, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value is ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the optic disc number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value has risen by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reproducible cyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to baseline, response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematokrit 33 - 39%), in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, abseamed in a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should be started as early as possible - for example, a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available before the start of the abseamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg on 10 consecutive days before, on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection at the end of dialysis can be given via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to insure the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from the treatment with any erythropoietin at an erythroblastoenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive abseamed or other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Cardiac infarction or stroke within a month before treatment, unstable angina (angina), increased risk of deep vein occlusion (e.g. venous thromboembolilies).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, escort or cavernous diseases: severe coronary artery disease, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular accident.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenia (PRCA) Very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an anti-body mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of active effect, defined as a reduction in haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reproducible value should be determined and the usual causes for non-fluidizing (ice-, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminimagintoxication, infections or infections, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value is low (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk for an anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anaemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical studies, increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given a haemoglobin target concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit from epoetines when haemoglobin concentration is increased over the concentration required for control of anaemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically controlled coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">For tumor patients under chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa and erythropoietin response should be considered for assessing the therapy efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapic-related anemia).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, before the start of epoetin-alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardio-vascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it is not possible to exclude that an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascularity occurred in the treatment of epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia, or to reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">When epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adjusted to increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues there is no indication of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF concerning hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemic, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis), arterial thrombosis, arthromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients suffering from erythropoetin therapy, as well as patients suffering from epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoietin therapy, patients with cardiovascular disease can come to thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.</seg>

<seg id="579">In the study of men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to citric acid or other bisphosphonate or any other component.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion area and osteoarthritis (the death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides clarification material for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains indications as to how the medicine is to be used, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and indicated when they should turn to the doctor.</seg>

<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic acetabular fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment by the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently developed low-traumatic acupuncture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by adding acetamol or ibuprofen after the application of acetamol.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinine clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Aclasta is not recommended since limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) since only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Preexisting hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the fast settling of the effect of zoledron acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, occasionally symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to have sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, according to twice a day at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before applying bisphosphonates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients needing dental interventions, no data is available if the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for each patient's treatment plan and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>

<seg id="607">The incidence of adverse event reported cases of atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51%) (51 of 3.862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3.852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder Zoledronic acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which expressed itself as decrease of the kidney function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatine Clearance (measured annually before administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure and limited renal function were similar in a clinical study for osteoporosis over three years compared to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatins within 10 days of application was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels, which were below the normal range of patients (less than 2.10 mmol / l), were 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received supplementary sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures after hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recent fracture fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of zoledronic acid in a large clinical study were reported via local reactions to the fusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteoecrosis in the jaw area has been controlled, especially in cancer patients, via osteoecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including citric acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 trial involving 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area of a patient treated with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of an overdose leading to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, the administration of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 females aged between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) T-Score for the femur dog ≤ 1.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric vortex fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new spinal fractures after a year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduction in the risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta had a lasting effect over three years, which reduced the risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the lumbar spine of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6.0%, the femoral neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies taken from the pelvic ridge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputed tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in trabecular bone volumes and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type-I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1.246 patients in periods of study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was held at 28% below baseline value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline value after 12 months and was held at 52% below baseline value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55% below baseline value for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50.000 to 125.000 I.U. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total dose was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased BMD compared to placebo treatment at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">Over a period of 24 months, the Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% in total and 4.3% on the femoral neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in untreated males compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once-weekly administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the percentage change of lumbar-lumbar BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment in the Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged more than 30 years with radiologically verified, mainly light to moderate morphine Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with the 2.7 to 3.0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronic acid in comparison to taking 30mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence compared to the baseline for Aclasta and Risedronat after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study (responded to therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with Risedronate in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response in 141 of the patients treated with Risedron could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of coledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearing from the large cycle with half-life t ½ α -0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours, followed by a long phase of elimination with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h irrespective of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of metabolized substances by cytochrome P450 enzymes is unlikely as chlorogenic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient populations (see Section 4.2) The renal clearance of the citric acid correlated with the creatinine clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, and was in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 g / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">The result is that a light (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function disorder until a creatinine clearance down to 35 ml / min does not require any canned adaptation of the zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since only limited data are available for severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-current intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC are six times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without any renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with IV application, the renal tolerance of zoledron acid in rats was determined by intravenous doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose which corresponds to the 7x of human-therapeutic exposure relative to AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions that exceed the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects were observed in other organs including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in trials with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such a skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Assessment Report (EPAR) in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations concerning the application of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonylurea and insulin can be maintained with the onset of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of sulfonylurea and insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's own insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, which makes type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos was investigated in tripletherapy; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered when applying doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos on the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylurea was 0.94% in lowering the HbA1c values, while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a lowering of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients receiving Actos also showed a lowering of HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months compared with 0.14% in patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypothesiology (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, congestive heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone mirrors - acid levels in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients in which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited a permit for the marketing of Actos across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, rounded and carry on one side the markings "15" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficiently regulated with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or incompatibilities (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of pioglitazone in patients under the age of 18 no data is available, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g. early cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserves.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased starting liver enzymes (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzymes must be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, upper stomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark harn, the liver enzymes must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision as to whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazone should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are presented.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can stem from fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients suffering from metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4% and hematokrits by 3.1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive Pioglitazone as oral dual or triple combination therapy with a sulfonylurea or as a two-fold combination therapy with insulin, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a decrease in visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thiazoldindian, including pioglitazone, an appearance or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescription physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological diagnosis should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or occurs, the treatment can be cancelled (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC by Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone diminishes the hyperinsulinemia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated in this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary modification of the turgor and the refractive index of the lens, as observed also in other hypoglycaemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone ALT ascents surged three times the upper limit of the normal range, as under placebo, but more rarely than in comparable groups of metformin or sulfonyl resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with preexisting advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than placebo when pioglitazone resides.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported about congestive heart failure among pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with congestive heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in the treated groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the trial period of 3.5 years, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day for seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone seems to have activated the activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) activation of specific nuclear receptors (PPAR-γ)), which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduced glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose classification in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has been continued for more than two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first six months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the onset of the therapy a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin in spite of three months of optimization were randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients suffering from pioglitazone the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients receiving insulin; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18 weeks study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and a rise in HDL cholesterol level as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced overall plasma levels and free fatty acids as compared to placebo, metformin or gliclaze and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone, while values declined under Metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the intimidating triglycerides, but also improved the post-fladial increased triglyceride levels, this both over an effect on triglyceride adsorption and also the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and preexisting advanced macrovascular disease were randomized in groups that received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral use, Pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in the plasma usually reach 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to its effectiveness is approximately three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-IV is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it has shown that Pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 Inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After an oral use of radioactive pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the fur (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-elimination life of unchanged pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated dosing of plasma volume magnification with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal, reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased rates of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) were induced by the urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolithic samples led to an increased frequency of colon tumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study for two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with each pioglitazone or Gliclazid were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinin quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the intimidating triglycerides, but also improved the postfladial increased triglyceride level, this both over an effect on tryglyceride adsorption as well as the hepatic tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target with regard to its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortal, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazone does not involve cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actrophane was studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to effectively use insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actrophane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror which indicated that the blood sugar levels were similar to that of another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actrophane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actrophane may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may have an effect on the blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package attachment).</seg>

<seg id="1184">Organ transplant recipients Since there are no experiences with organ transplants, the use of Febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease In patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated cardiac insufficiency, treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other harnacid-burning medicines, acute gout attacks can occur during the treatment process, because the reduction in serum levels of serum can initially be used to mobilize uric acid deposits in the tissue.</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical studies showed slight abnormalities of liver function values in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function before the start of the febuxostasis and in the subsequent course depending on clinical findings (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwas did not conduct any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition can lead to a rise in theophylline levels (an inhibiting of theophylline metabolism was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen was 250 mg 2 times a day with an increase in febuxostasis (CMAX 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient required at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects, 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x had an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a antacid, which contains magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delayed absorption of Febuxostat (around 1 hour) and a reduction in CMAX by 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy Data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies may not cause side effects of febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall febuxostats in pivotal study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistical significant differences were found and no causal relationship with Febuxostat could be found.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were arteriosclerotic and / or myocardial infarction or a decompensated cardiac insufficiency in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) and rare (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects, which could appear in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of febuxostat and which were reported more than once in all Febuxostat treatment groups, are listed below.</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data of Phase 3 open extension study showed that prolonged reduction in serum levels of &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed a decrease in the incidence of gout attacks (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gutter node, which in 54% of patients had a complete disappearance of the gout nodes until month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH values (&gt; 5.5 µW / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) increased from Febuxostat to dosing simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is larger than the dose- proportionate increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After ingestion of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the CMAx amounts to about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5,0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change in the percentage of serum levels was observed, provided that this was checked (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>

<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found as unaltered febuxostat (30%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion through the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found as unaltered febuxostat (12%), Acylglucosonid of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups of kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased by approximately the 1.8-fold of 7.5 μ y ⋅ yr-ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ g ⋅ yr-ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines approved in the European Union, the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D was lower (11%) compared to those treated with ADROVANCE (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that indicates that the Alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE is exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system, such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), constipation, diarrhea (flatulence), ulceration (ulcera), oesophage (bloated stomach), and acidic uptake.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components ADROVANCE must not be used.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, ovophageal ulcera and ösophageal erosions, rarely followed by malignant striktures, were reported in patients taking alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The physician should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malignant reactions, and patients should be advised to consult the drug in case of symptoms of an ophageal irritation like dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious adverse side effects seems to be elevated in patients who do not use the medicine correctly and / or continue to use it after symptoms that indicate a nasty irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcers, including some serious and complications, were reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment arms contain predominantly intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available that provide clues as to whether bisphosphonate treatment in patients requiring a lower jaw surgery reduces the risk of osteoarthritis in the jaw.</seg>

<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of alendronate if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking alendronate, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, alendronate was taken together in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without any clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not used during pregnancy or by breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate leave no indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoarthritis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bisphosphonates; most reports stem from cancer patients, but osteoporosis diagnoses were also reported.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The therapeutic equivalence of alendronate once a week 70 mg (n = 519) and alendronate 10 mg daily (n = 370) was demonstrated in a one-year multicenter study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="1318">The effects of alendronate on bone mass and fracture in postmenopausal women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) and the fracture intervention trial (FIT: n = 6.459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In phase III studies, BMD's moderate ascents with alendronate were 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8% at the spine, 5.9% at Femurhal and 7.8% at the Trochanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">Compared to the placebo group, the group treated with Alendronat decreased by 48% (Alendronate 3.2% versus placebo 6,2%) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more vertebral fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the BMD has continued to retain the BMD of the spine and the Trochanter; also the BMD of the femur and the entire body was maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit consisted of two placebo-controlled trials, in which alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, Alendronate's daily administration reduced the appearance of at least one new cyclone correction by 47% (Alendronate 7.9% versus placebo 15,0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption to an intravenous reference dose was the mean oral bioavailability of alendronate in women 0.64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after nightly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability decreased accordingly to approximately 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronate was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis, alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy volunteers, the administration of oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day over five days) did not lead to any clinically meaningful change in the oral bioavailability of alendronate (increase in average of 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 distribution studies in rats have shown that alendronate is distributed in soft tissue after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly circulated into the bone or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">After IV administration of a single dose of 14C-Alendronate, about 50% of the radioactive substance was excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the feces.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of alendronate was 71 ml / min and systemic clearance not exceeded 200 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="1331">In rats, alendronate is not excreted via the acid or alkaline transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the excretion of other drugs by these transport systems.</seg>

<seg id="1335">Secretion In the administration of radioactive-marked vitamin D3 in healthy subjects, the average elimination of radioactivity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4%, in the feces after 4 days 4.9%.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Characteristics in patients with preclinical studies have shown that the proportion of alendronate, which is not stored in the bone, is quickly excreted via the urine.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Although no clinical data is available, the renal elimination of alendronate as well as in animal tests can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study were presented to 668 patients with kidney transplant, whereas the use of Advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in whom the transplant was rejected after a treatment duration of one year (for example, by examining how often a new organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter follow-up studies of 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplant have been carried out and examined how Advagraf is taken up in comparison with Prograf / Prograft from the body.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should associate this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this may lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overdose induced immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and daily dose; Modification of the formulation or regime should only be performed under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug control and appropriate dose adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Advagraf dosage should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood levels (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus chapter levels should be checked prior to the changeover and over two weeks after changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both veneer and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus valley mirrors are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night ransplantation phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because Tacrolimus is a low-Clearance substance, an adjustment of the Advagraf-Dosisschemas can take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application For the suppression of graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further canned adaptation may be required later as the pharmacokinetic of Tacrolimus can change in the course of the stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - When converting Prograf to Advagraf, a transplant receiver of twice daily dose of Prograf capsules should be converted to one once daily intake of Advagraf, this change has to take place in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After a change from other immunosuppressants to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the prophylaxis of graft rejection must commence.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplants In adult patients, which are converted to Advagraph, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken daily in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pancreatic and bowel transplanted patients, Prograf was administered in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day in patients with transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Canned adaptation in special patient populations patients with restricted liver function To maintain blood tallies in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetic of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular assessment of the serum creatine level, a calculation of the level of the creatine and a monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy is advised caution (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the level of tallow in whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases using full-blood-Tacrolimus-Talking-Levels.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus valley level during the first two weeks after transplant, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-talk levels of Tacrolimus should also be checked after switching from Prograf to Advagraf, dose adjustment, changes of immunosuppressive therapy or while using substances which might change the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments to the dose may need several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level of blood levels in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the blood cells of Tacrolimus in full blood usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in the case of cardioid and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects which may occur in a result of Tacrolimus under or over exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and daily dose; Modification of the formulation or regime should only be made under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplants and graft recipients in childhood, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies during a treatment with Advagraf (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea there is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, prograf was referred to as cardiomyopathy called ventricular or septum hypertrophy, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease, treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infection, overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of maligner skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus, symptoms of PRES such as headache, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and vision disturbances, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3E can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and consequently increase or decrease the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus (blood levels) with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose to maintain consistent levels (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly distinctive interaction was associated with antifungal drugs such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, istraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macropolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the elevated oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of Tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous application of Tacrolimus can be metabolized with medicines, which are metabolized by CYP3E, whose metabolism impacts.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase the exposure to hormonal exposure, it is particularly cautious in decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a low number of transplant patients do not indicate that in tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP based on the ADVATE safety profile, which necessitates a filing of PSURs every 6 months, has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited was officially announced to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company will withdraw its application for authorisation for the transfer of Advexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni's cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissue (tissue that connects and supports other structures within the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus which has been genetically engineered to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is an" "" "Adenovirus" "" "that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce any copies of itself and therefore does not cause any infection in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumour and thus allow cancer cells to regenerate normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the p53 gene that is not broken in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and for killing the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">With Li-Fraumeni's cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient with Li-Fraumeni's cancer in the lower abdomen, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers of the company to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">In the opinion of the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP about whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by an allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (blocked nose), are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the trial, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">When considering all kinds of hay fever symptoms, besides constipation of the nose, patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">When only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients demonstrated an alleviation of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, mouth dry, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to perloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be used in patients suffering from a narrow angle glaucoma, hyperthyrosis (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyrosis), hyperthyrosis (cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of haemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it can be swallowed whole (i.e. without biting, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used for children under 12 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, since the activity of pseudoephedrine may decrease with time during long-term use.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy as needed with Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As the aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergoline, ergotamine, Dihydrogotamine or other deongestives which can be used peroral or nasally as aberratic Rhinologics (phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, Naphazoline etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data are not sufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are insufficient to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment must be reduced in case of hypertension or a tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache).</seg>
<seg id="1677">• Patients with hypertonia • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with hypertonia • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder obstruction or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to be deprecated at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests as antihistamines can otherwise inhibit positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce them to scale.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with discoatadin in which erythromycin or ketoconazol were additionally administered, no clinically relevant interactions or alterations of the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with Desloratadin and the placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not block in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 is not inhibiting and neither a substrate is nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerinaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans, and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aero should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a dizziness that can result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental alertness, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letterings.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult Miktion, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, cardiac arrhythmias, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precordial pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is especially likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil rigidity and - dilator, skin erythema, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-seltin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. daily, there was no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in recommended dosage can cause further sympaimetic effects, such as increasing blood pressure, tachycardia or manifestation of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years of age took part with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereas 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerosaze tablets was significantly higher compared to the overall score for the symptoms (except nasal mucosa swelling), significantly higher than under monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerosaze tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by means of the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerosaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender, age or ethnicity affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of an individual dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin can be detected within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the flow-equilibrium of Desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were poor in metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine is bioequivalent to exposure to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional safety harmacology studies, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the Pharmacovigilance System described in module 1.8.1 of the application is well established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergies rhinitis (hay fever) such as sneezing, running or itching nose and tearing or itching eyes while constipating the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Tell your doctor if you experience or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases under the application of Aerinaze: • hypertension • Cardiac disease, palpitations • Cardiac arrhythmias • nausea and headache, or a strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">If you take Aeropaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When used in the recommended dosage, it is not expected that aerinaze results in dizziness or decreases attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take Aerinaze if you forgot to take a dose in good time, get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will negatively affect you or you will notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin it was rarely reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (breathing difficulties, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">Cases of palpitations, heart chasing, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscular pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisat, 2.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to 11 years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies in seasonal allergies rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by determining the symptoms (itching, number and size of the thunder, sleeping and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution for intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of an allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius showed an average decrease in the symptom score (symptom score) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urticaria the decline in symptoms was after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, lauatadin, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit for the placing of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of an allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and can be terminated following the end of the symptoms and resumed in their reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persisting allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be advised that in very rare cases it may result in dizziness, which can lead to impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius daily, compared to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue (1,2%), mouth dry (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most frequent side effect was headache, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with Desloratadin and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study involving up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecule P-Selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was reported as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study of adults, Desloratadin 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement variables of flight performance including amplification of subjective sleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively also be classified into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown from the total score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated as representative for other forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of the etiology of the different forms, is similar and chronic patients can be easily prospectively recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine release is a causative factor in all urticarial diseases, it is expected that in addition to the chronic idiopathic urticaria, it is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of dots at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronically idiopathic urticaria the majority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with discoatadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation following daily use of perloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out completely.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In-vivo non-CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that CYP2D6 does not inhibit CYP2D6 and neither a medium nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7,5 mg, meals (fatty, high-calorie breakfasts) did not affect the availability of loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies carried out with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin in a comparable degree to the toxicity profile of Desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support treatment of an infectious Rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to exclusion from upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise Desloratadin and experience a higher substance load (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which metabolize limited, is identical to that in children that metabolise normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains saccharose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-lactose-absorption or a sucrose isomaltase- insufficiency of this drug should not be taken.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in the course of clinical trials with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazol were additionally given (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius tablets and alcohol, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased (see section 5.1).</seg>

<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years of age, who were eligible for an antihistamine treatment, received an average daily dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronically idiopathic urticaria and the profile of Desloratadin are similar in adults and children, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in which desloratadin was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study of adults and adolescents in which desloratadin was used in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days in adults, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>

<seg id="1782">As shown from the total score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of pruritus and the reduction of size and number of dots at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited-metabolising phenotype was similar in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater in blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multiple-dose study with syrup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are limited metabolized.</seg>

<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that is to protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from human to human because humans have not built up immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After the vaccine is passed, the immune system recognises the part of the flu virus in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to produce antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus of this stem.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognizes as a foreign body), was purified and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>

<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to take in, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgenerase should only be decreed if the doctor has checked what antiviral drugs the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus being addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between the ages of four and twelve, and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Asgenerase decreases the amount of HIV in the blood when used in combination with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids cannot cure AIDS, but can delay damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Asgenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral drugs, but without ritonavir, in two main studies involving 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase, which was reinforced with low doses of Ritonavir, was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used to use protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the viral load changes after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few responded to treatment by the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study of adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the medicine Agenerase increased the viral load after 16 weeks treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase together with Ritonavir had a stronger viral load after four weeks than in patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase should also not be used in patients who use St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines, which are degraded just like asgenerase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other drugs against HIV there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected individuals and children treated with protease inhibitors outweigh the risks over four years.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Asgenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee noted that the benefit of amusing in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally authorised under" "" "unusual circumstances" "" "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted Glaxo Group Limited to the company Glaxo Group Limited to approve agenerations in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Agenerase should usually be given to amprenavir pharmacokinetic boosters combined with low doses of Ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should be carried out considering the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% lower than of amprenavir as capsule; hence, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram is not exchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of rionavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are used without the increased addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenerase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Asgenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetical data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenerase should not be given concurrently with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates in the cytochrome P450-isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be reminded that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agenerase does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generally, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with preexisting restricted liver function, including chronic hepatitis, show an increased frequency of hepatic dysfunctions under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects including Cushing and suppression of adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an simultaneous administration of amusing with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of Myopathies including rhubdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who use these drugs at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is also given with amprenavir at the same time, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of oppiate, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Asgenerase should be reduced to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses associated with the treatment of medications associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug dependant factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, there are reports of an increase in haemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemorrhages.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, antiretroviral therapy (ART) may develop inflammatory reactions to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is assumed (including use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase should not be given concurrently with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates in the cytochrome P450-isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir must not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are predominantly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in the AUC of amprenavir leading to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, undesirable effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be degraded by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">When a patient already uses Johanniskraut, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased by 30% for CMAX when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies, dosages of 600 mg of amprenavir were used twice a day and ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, proving the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% degraded when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of rionavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin-values of amprenavir in the plasma, which were achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of rionavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, close meshed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study on the use of Agenerase in combination with didanosine, but due to the attached component of didanosine it is recommended that the revenues of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and available limited data suggest that Nevirapin may lower the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is advisable because Delavirus might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are used together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with asphytic, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic trials with erythromycin in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole at 200 mg ketoconazole in plasma led to 2.69fold compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir after 200mg ketoconazole.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may also interact with asgenerase if they are used together with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with aeriase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advised that antacids are not taken at the same time as Agenerase, as it may result in resorption disruptions.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzymatic ductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma level of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, anodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous ingesting with Agenerase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase associated side effects including hypotension, vision disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of amusing with kritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">For HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels while administering agenerations are expected.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma level increases in these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lead to myopathy, including rhubdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amprenavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilising the mirror, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while the addition of amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, asgenerase should not be used along with orally taken Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while using Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam caution is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate possible increase in Midazolam plasma level by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of oppiate, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to adjust the amprenavirus dose if amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asphytic, enhanced control of the INR (International Standard ised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example, Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in conjunction with Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may be used during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactating rats, amprenavir related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether amprenavir is transferred to human breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study involving gravid rats, which was administered from the nipples in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not impaired by the administration of amprenavir on the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of agenerations was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to the treatment break.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not clarified whether they are associated with the use of Agenerase or any other drug used at the same time, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PRODE3001, PRODE3006), in which patients treated with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4) evaluated by investigators as associated with the study medication and which occurred in more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment (degree 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and faecal subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral not treated subjects treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / cidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (strokes) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study ProAB 3006, in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under amprenavir were 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 patients (11%) in 241 patients at Indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderately distinct, erythematous or makulocule nature, with or without itching and usually disappeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, antiretroviral therapy (ART) may develop inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In patients treated with PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice a day together with low-dose kritavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosing, the patient can observe signs of intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supportive measures must be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gene and gag-pol- polyproteinvortices with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro versus HIV-1 IIIB was studied in both acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of amprenavir lies in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not previously treated patients with currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir-based treatment schemas with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen out of 434 antiretroviral patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients not previously treated with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those found in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) with protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred more than 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance than the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I5V and L90M in conjunction with increased phenotypic resistance to fosamprenavir with ritonavir as well as a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data and it is recommended to always draw up current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that market diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistance against Ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data about cross resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral not previously treated patients, in which a Fosamprenavirus-containing schema failed (one of these showed resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir at the beginning of treatment and another against animal-blazavir), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), sauna quinavir / ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir / ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amprenavir retains its activity against some other protease inhibitors-resistant isolates; obtaining this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early termination of a seeding therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the trial PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which pretreated adults received either Agenerase (600 mg twice daily) and nucleobordanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosed Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threescore (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the Study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis noted the non-subordination of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1-RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1-RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-submission threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbiased asgenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of whom 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, the Agenerase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice a day, 20 mg / kg twice a day and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no dosed Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs that were administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the benefits of" "" "unbiased" "" "agenerations should be considered in therapy optimisation in children treated with PI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the medium duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased for CMAX by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was impacted by the intake of food, although the simultaneous food intake influenced the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be locked into the tissue by means of a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the blood stream.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, is likely to remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component during dosing intervals varies depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state over the range of CMAx, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3E or form a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are simultaneously given with ferase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The administration of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily ammonia exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; hence, Agenerase solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained twice daily after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir without simultaneous ritonavir administration.</seg>
<seg id="2055">Long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats occurred in male animals using benign hepatocellular Adenomas in dosages that spoke to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8-fold (rat) of the human exposure, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the origination of hepatocellular Adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests, mice lymphom test, microkernel test of rats and chromosomal aberrations tests on human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase activity.</seg>
<seg id="2060">So far no significant liver toxicity has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of agenerations nor by the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies in young animals treated with age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly lower (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure to humans, were observed, however, a number of minor changes including thymus spruce and minor skeletal changes that indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are used without the increased addition of ritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir that should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be taken with caution in patients with weak or mild liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2070">508% increased by 30% for CMAX when ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin-values of amprenavir in the plasma, which were achieved with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of rionavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir is administered twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, close meshed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these medicines are used together, caution is advised; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be undertaken as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with asphytic, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, anodipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nipampin and Verapamil can be increased by amprenavir, which may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of test subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asphytic, enhanced control of the INR (International Standard ised Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin by amprenavir by 22% or more.</seg>

<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experiences in patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, therefore the application is not recommended for pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that in large tumors (&gt; 7,25 cm2) there is a lower likelihood of response to Imiquimodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod has not been studied for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lips.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the use of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical spots outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the forearms and hands does not support effectiveness in this application, so such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually decrease in intensity during therapy or go back after treatment with Imiquimodine cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong, the treatment may be exposed for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical trial shows that patients with more than 8 lesions showed a lower total cure rate than in patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to immune-stimulating properties, Imiquimod Creme should be applied with care in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies do not cause direct or indirect detrimental effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth, or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although no quantifiable level of serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) quantified after several topical application, no recommendation can be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine cream related side effects in trials involving three-week treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of cowards (33.7% of patients treated with Imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the Imiquimodine cream in relation to side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Basalioma patients treated with Imiquimodine cream from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical study reported side-effects listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly with the application of the Imiquimodine cream in relation to side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application location (22% of patients treated with Imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects indicated by 252 in placebo-controlled phase III clinical studies with Imiquimodine-cream treated patients with actinic keratosis are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs proposed according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimod-Crème it was frequently applied to local skin reactions including Erythem (61%), excreation / flaking (23%) and edema (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs proposed according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimod-Crème it was very common to severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and to severe formation and tasting (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials to investigate the application of Imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratose, alopecia was observed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral absorption of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most severe side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted of hypotonia which normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic investigation, increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines have been detected based on the topical application of Imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the warts in an Imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Patients who had been treated with Imiquimod healed completely at 60% of all patients who had been treated with Imiquimod; this was the case at 20% of the patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with Imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five maltreatment per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary supernatural basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data obtained from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod during three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic ac- lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 treatment area on the unhairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% for patients with clinical settlement after one or two treatment periods (35 / 128 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external tilt, actinic keratose and supernatural basal cell carcinoma usually do not appear in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Creme was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimodine cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three-week treatment for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when used in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The estimated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-time after subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that Imiquimod resorption after topical application to MC-ill skin of patients aged 6-12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or supernatural basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg of CG lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for four months for the dermal application showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two year study on carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not show tumours in the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a small systemic absorption out of the human skin and is not mutagen, there is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumours appeared in the group of mice treated with the substance-free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study examined the safety of the drug, but its efficacy was measured (by examining its effect on reducing GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyma lowered the concentrations of GAG in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged more than five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion place.</seg>

<seg id="2286">Aldurazyma is indicated for long-term enzymatic treatment in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyma should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes in single steps.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side-effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyma should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting, in which recovery facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">As a result of the phase III clinical trial, nearly all patients with IgG antibodies against Laronidase are expected to form normally within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reactions have to be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As there is little experience regarding the resumption of treatment after a longer period of interruption, caution must be taken care of due to the theoretically elevated risk of hypersensitivity after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the infusion begins with medicines (antihistamines and / or antipyrenka), to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of mild or moderate infusion, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe infusion-related reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>

<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the preoperative response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyma should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular absorption of larvonidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, which include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">As there are no data on newborns exposed to the larvae of the mother's milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during the treatment with Aldurazyma.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical studies were mostly classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase III study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyma, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 and up to 4 years, are listed in the following table following the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, respiratory failure and facial edema (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects associated with Aldurazyma, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe expiration and treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it occurred within 3 months from the onset of the treatment to a serum version, with a more severe follow-up in patients aged less than 5 years (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until early retirement from the study), no detectable antibodies were present in 13 / 45 patients, including 3 patients who had never come to the server version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with a low antibody level showed a robust reduction in the GAG level in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody tides a variable reduction of GAG in the urine could be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal or low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic larvonidase activity in vitro that did not affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for enzyme replacement therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of accumulated substrats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and taken up by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose 6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were examined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyme each week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement in lung function and cessability presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as follows from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased further proportionately to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment, 22 (85%) reached normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease in the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg of creatine) was observed, which remained constant up to the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">As a result of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (an expected percentage of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute range, range of motion of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening of 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe follow-up form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were observed for this age group The younger patients with the severe follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe expiration there were limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosing regimens were performed on the GAG mirror in urine, liver volume and 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule of 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may represent an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another medicine for cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not previously been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is given to cisplatin together with cisplatin, an anti-emetic drug may be added before or after the application of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood type changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, stopped or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of pemetremixed into its active form occurs more easily in cancerous cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural mesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy, with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine for cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine for cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months at the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared with docetaxel compared with 7.9 months.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous cell cells showed longer survival times when using Alimta compared with the comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval for the transport of Alimta in the entire European Union to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V..</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each diarrhea bottle must be dissolved with 4.2ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The required volume of the necessary dose is taken from the tube and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma, except in cases of epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, except in the majority of epithelial histology (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the pemetrexed application as well as on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the duration of treatment as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week before the first pemetrexed dose and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive pemetrexed, a complete blood-image should be created before each application including differentiation of the leukocytes and a thrombocyte count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">A dose-examination must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking into consideration the Nadirs of the blood pattern or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients have to be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria comply with the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degrees 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop haematological toxicity ≥ F3 (except neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient receives the value prior to treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity of 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reductions. 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at age 65 years or above, there is an increased side-risk risk compared to patients aged 65 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinin-clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Biliruby limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold of the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically examined in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone-level immunosuppression and Pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophrophic capacity has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute number of neutrophils, thrombocyte count and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 haematological and non-uterine toxicity, such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees of 3 / 4 neutropenia were added when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients who have been treated with pemetrexed have to be instructed to apply folate and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measures to reduce toxic toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) need to avoid simultaneous ingestoidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsaliva cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g a day) for at least 2 days before the treatment with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with pemetrexed treatment have to avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life time for at least 5 days prior to therapy, day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with a clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space, a drainage of the effusion will be considered before the pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials involving pemetrexed occasional when administered in combination with another cytotoxic compound.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated life vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since there is the possibility of irreversible deterioration of reproductive capacity by means of pemetrexed, men should be advised before the procedure of treatment to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g a day) can result in reduced phemetremixed excretion with the consequence of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is therefore recommended if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data with regard to the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with pemetrexed for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy calls for an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Breast Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed should not be used during pregnancy, unless necessary and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since there is the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity by means of pemetrexed, men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects of the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antifungal that exerts its effect by breaking important metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetrexed acts as an antitorture with multiple attack points by blocking the thymidylatynthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and Glycinamidribonucleotide myltransferase (GARFT), which are folatdependent key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis by thymidine and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, easy-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus chemonaiven patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma, showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had clinically significant advantage of survival compared to those patients who were treated with cisplatin only.</seg>

<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) may increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich meal or a fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine for diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a treatment with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic may need to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients taking ali as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-related measures in order to prevent the possible failure of the oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (international standard ised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat up to 4 full years in clinical trials, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, it should be recommended to use a complementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">Following the administration of a one-time dose Amiodarone, a marginal decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect detrimental effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on the available data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known adverse events reported after the rollout of orlistat is unknown, as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg. three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to normal overweight and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Most of the reported cases of orlistat overdosing reported either side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a rapid return of any systemic effects caused by the non-inhibiting properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect sets in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bondage to the active Serin-remainder of the gastric and pankreatical lips.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies in adults with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fat-reduced nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in the body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as percentage of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight loss was observed in both studies over 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (baseline value 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline: 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">Mean change in LDL cholesterol was with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (output value 3.30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (output value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (output value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolised orlistat were not measured 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, not metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be sporadically and detected in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study of obese patients, with a minimum dose of systemic resorption, two major metabolites, i.e. M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after splitting the N-Formyl-leucine group), were identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will negatively affect you or you will notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules, resulting in increased fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after treatment commence, as you may have not yet consistently reduced the fat percentage in the diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimise nutritional accompanying symptoms: • Begin a few days, or better a week, before taking the capsules with a reduced fat diet. • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood of you to exceed your fat limit decreases. • Share your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal, not to take it in the form of a fat-rich main dish or a substantial countertop as you may have done in other programs for weight loss. • Most people in which these concomitant phenomena occur, learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies that are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by the additional administration of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended since there is not enough information on the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-Hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies at 1 842 adults who received chemotherapies which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the case of chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi had no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">Chemotherapies that are moderate for nausea and vomiting showed 81% of the patients treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (153 out of 189), 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 out of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the placing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alxi is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in severely emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in excessively emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids received before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with anamnestic obstructions or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapeutic application Aloxi is not intended to be used either for prevention or for nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies Palonosetron did not block the activity directed against tumours of the five chemotherapeutics studied (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a steady-stex concentration of orals metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 Inhibitors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (ammiodarone, chlorpromaine, fluoxetine, haloperidol, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience of using palonosetron in human pregnancies does not occur, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events (633 patients) were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which could at least be related to Aloxi, headache (9%) and obstpation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration of the administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">The group with the highest dosage showed similar frequencies of adverse events as in other dosage groups; there were no dose-drug interactions.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably no effective treatment with a alxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 of dolasetron (half-life time 7.3 hours) were given that was given intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m ² cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin, as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, were compared with patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron per day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate-etogenic chemotherapy and the study of heavily emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Following clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular degeneration and repression and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy subjects was the assessment of the ECG effects of I.V. administered palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration following an initial decrease of plasma concentrations there is a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportional in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous injection of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase of the Palonosetron plasma concentration measured in 11 testicular carcinoma was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations indicate that the total score (AUC0- ∞) achieved at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron was comparable to that measured after a one-off intravenous administration of 0.75 mg. however, the CMAx was higher after the single dose of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the isoenzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 microgram / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unchanged substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolt injection in healthy subjects, the total body's office was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only by expositions that are considered sufficient above the maximum humanoid exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies there are indications that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular degeneration and repolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times the therapeutic exposure of humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined in humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006 a negative report approved by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in which the approval of approval for the use of the Alphe6 million IE / ml injection solution provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheans should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug-like ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also known as the "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheans should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue has damages, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminneurotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) is brought in to stimulate the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alphead presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheans was compared to the efficacy of the reference drug in 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non business purposes only provided by CHMP to announce the approval for placing on the market?</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been given to the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alphead and Roferon-A was similar in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheans, the disease was more common in more patients than with the reference drug; in addition, Alphead had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition to this, the test used in the study investigates the question of the extent to which the medicine triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug), not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection accompanying with crust formation) and small infected infirmary (cracking or cutting wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not intended to be used for the treatment of infections, which have been proven or probably caused by methicillins-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because it may not affect these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients less than 18 years, the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking bacterial detoxification (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the treatment ended.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected house-dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together in house-wound, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it has been established that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (protein filled cavities in the body tissues) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the surface of the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo outweigh the risks of short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, infected small incinerations, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007 the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy can be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation due to the use of Retapamulin ointment, the treatment is broken off, the ointment must be carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy for the infection may be begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not intended to be used for the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinobinulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical use on abraded skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazol, the mean Retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx increased by 81% after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on skimped skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients Dosisadjustments are not considered necessary if topical Retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding implications for the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the treatment with Altargo continues / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied altargo, the most commonly reported adverse drug induced fertility was at the administration point of approximately 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of retapamulin is based on selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterially ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and located in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptidyltransferase centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, block partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal creation of active 50s-ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should experts seek advice on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the use of retapamulin at least some forms of infection, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to respond to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin ointment was applied on a daily basis under occlusion on intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin ointment twice daily for 5 days for the topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion on humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 of skimped skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the retina inulin IC50 for PGP.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolisms The in vitro oxidative metabolisation of retapamulin in human liver microcosms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, below low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rat microkernel test for in-vivo-investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats show signs of restricted fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in an exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skated skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats, ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ≥ 3-times the estimated human exposure (see above), development stocking (reduced body weight of foetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity have been determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the approval for the placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and used as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the approval for the placing on the market commits itself to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional RMP updates agreed with CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use," the updated RMP is also to be submitted with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area should end the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if you were not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment turns into any of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gauze cover unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose-existing vaccination plan, whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix should only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by" "" "contributing" "" "to the immune system (the natural defences of the body)" "" "as it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and produces antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccination that has been approved since 1996 and the vaccination that has been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, adults and twoys are given children as part of a three-dose vaccination schedule.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix contain adult identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix Adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix ran between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children one month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to a six-month gap between injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">The European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the European Commission in August 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for priming with Ambirix is made up of two doses, the first dose is given at the time of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster vaccination is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combined vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibody levels are based on the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons, who have responded to hepatitis C vaccination, need a refresher vaccination as protection, since they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, in the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the injection of the vaccine, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the normalization scheme with the combined vaccine is recommended, which contains 360 ELISA elements of formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no adequate anti-HAV- and Anti-HBs antibody level after priming, so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraocular injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal immune defect, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneously with thrombocytopenia or blood clotting as it may result in haemorrhage in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Ambirix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time combined with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and haemophilus type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it has to be assumed that there is no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial which was carried out with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was similar to the frequency observed in earlier thiomer and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies 2029 vaccines Ambirix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15, Ambirix's compatibility was compared with the combination of 3 cans.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and futility on a calculation basis for each vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">After the administration of Ambirix, pain was observed in 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects following the administration of a dose of the 3-doses-combination-vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had received the Ambirix were suffering pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maternity was comparable to pro-band (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects receiving Ambirix, compared with 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-cans combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maturation was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1- to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgruppe was similar to that observed with the 3-cans-combination-vaccine with 360 ELISA-units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per tape, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccines reported about serious side effects during the 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccination scheme with 360 ELISA- units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis B and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted for vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the serum conversions for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The conversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 received the standard combined vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was valuable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) against Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccines received either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccination scheme with a combined vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were at the time of priming between 12 and 15 years, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6-month vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to those found following vaccination of 3 cans with a combination-vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA elements of formalin-inactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study aged 12 to including 15-year-old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 month vaccine scheme compared to that in the 0-12 month vaccine scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the booster of a combined diphtheria, Tetanus-, azellular Pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 haemophilus flu vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current wording in adults showed similar seroprotect- and sero- conversion rates similar to the previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resuspening of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You may feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not completely protect against an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 cans.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the two vaccines have been administered (although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those following hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to a previous vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually scheduled administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of an inoculation with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vaccine dose (360 ELISA units of a formalin-inactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection before the vaccination series ends.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix is injected into people who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not injected into the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your body's defense, or if you / your child undergo a haemodialysis / subtract.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which have been known since the initial approval for the placing on the market, CHMP assumed that the benefits-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was placed in traffic only in one Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in pre-history.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonia is - split into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomiessis (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study because Ammonaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a pseudo drug, i.e. without active substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps may also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or flavor release, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonaps in patients with urea cycle interferes with high ammoniacal values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "unusual circumstances" "" "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine was present." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with a complete enzyme shortage already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests itself after the first month of life) there is an indication for use if there is a hyperammonia encephalopathy in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatynthetase deficiency should receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with difficulty swallowing as there is a risk of the formation of esophagus ulcers if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure and associated with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">As metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat are done through the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">Subcutaneous injection of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) resulted in a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve lesions in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted by humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during breastfeeding is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate medication, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">An overdose case occurred in a 5 month old infant with an unintentional single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound which conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); therefore phenylacetylglutamine is suitable as an alternative carrier to the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with urea cycle disorders can be assumed to be produced for each gram of monosodium glutamine between 0.12 and 0.15 g. of phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infest, and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or their sticking-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through haemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrous excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (however within the first months of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients it occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency), which were recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and then treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylacetate is known to be oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and with liver cirrhosis following item and repeated discharge of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients following intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were measured 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">According to different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), phenylacetate can be detected in the plasma in the majority of patients with urea-cycle disturbances or hemoglobinopathies.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis treated repeatedly with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day orally in three single cans), the average phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Secretion The drug is secreted by the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat had no adverse effects in rats treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who cannot yet swallow tablets, or have patients with difficulty swallowing) or a gastrostomiessis or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins within the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithine transcarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granules contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat) before birth, lesions were found in the pyramid cells of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactate medication, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); therefore phenylacetylglutamine is suitable as an alternative carrier to excrete waste</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that sodium phenylbutyrat is produced for each gram between 0.12 and 0.15 g. of phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral solitary dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were measured 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life the patient can keep the finished product unmatched for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the middle measuring scoop is 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If carried out with laboratory tests, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS because sodium phenylbutyrate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you take AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">You may not use AMMONAPS during breastfeeding, as the medicine may pass into breast milk and damage your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headaches, flavoring disorders, reduction of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and deterioration of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency reception of your hospital in order to initiate a corresponding treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used for the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for instance in case of unstable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stem-lift" (an anomalous measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients that undergo a PCI exam, a higher dose is given and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14,000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angioxin was compared with alluvial administration or in conjunction with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">The PCI often used a stent (a short tube which stays in the artery to prevent a closure) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abcirituximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was just as effective in terms of all indicators as heparin, except in severe bleeding, where it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must also not be used in patients who have recently had bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a cardiac infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted authorisation to the Company, The Medicines Company, UK Ltd, for the placing of angioxins in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST attack infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended dose of angioxin in patients with ACS is an intravenous stub of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If the patient is subsequently PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dosage of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Just before the procedure, a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angioxin in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous stub of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and an intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a sole bolus-administration of Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI interference is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is reduced to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt will be 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT levels, reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed before application and the stub dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT attaches to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered properly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate renal impairment (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, a second take dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal damage which were included in the III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which was admitted for approval, the ACT attaches 5 minutes after the application of the bivalirudin-Bolus without dosage adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular lifting.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against hirudine • Active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to malfunctioning of the hemostatic system and / or irreversible coagulation disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of blood tests on arterial puncture points occur in PCI patients among Bivalirudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may in principle have bleeding disorders throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients treated with warfarin and treated with bivalirudine, a monitoring of the INR-value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bivalirudine again reaches the level existing prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregators), it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudine with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental investigations are insufficient in terms of impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth, or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Bivalidation group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding, such as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among bivalirudin than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY serious hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point compartment, which requires radiological or surgical intervention, reduction of hemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding post, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed blood localizations, which occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with Bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI study.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparative groups treated with Heparin, it was more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently among bivalirudin than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after extensive use in practice and are grouped according to system organclasses in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosage, the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately broken down and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiography contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thrombi inhibitor, which binds to both the catalytic center and the anionlinn region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thromboin is bound in liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of Bivalirudin to thromboine, and hence its effect, is reversible since Thrombin regenerates the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, which regenerates the function of the active centre of thromboine.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Moreover, Bivalirudin was not able to induce a thrombocytopenia / heparininduced Thrombocytopenia / heparininduced Thrombocytopenia / heparininduced Thrombocytopenia / heparininduced Thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is evidenced by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">In the case of a PCI study, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivalirudin should be given and infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary artery (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST raising infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor before angiography (at the time of randomisation) or on the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography in 72 hours, were equally distributed over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and approximately 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Primary analysis and results from ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1- year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 An ACUITY severe bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: intraocular, retroperito-Neale, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the area of puncture, reduction of hemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding post, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are presented in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angioxin in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that bivalirudine as peptide inhibits catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent reuse of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metaphor resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4-binding of the N-terminale sequence by Thrombin is not effective because of the loss of his affinity with the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination is carried out in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a terminally half-life time of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks with exposure to 10 times the clinical steady-state plasma concentration) limited to superimposed pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Adverse events due to long-term physiological strain as a reaction to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure comparable to those in clinical use, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutanally (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or unable to process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisin differs very slightly from acting insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has shorter duration than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body is not able to work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type 1 diabetes in adults with Type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin void.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after 6 months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin-lulisin or any of the other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">Doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or subcutaneous through continuous infusion into the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of the reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with reduced liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the effect of the action, the brand (producer), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can undergo a change in the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or abortion of treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to a different type of insulin or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of hypoglycemia treatment depends on the effective profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, discopathies, fibrates, fluoroxetine, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic counter-regulation can be alleviated or absent from the effect of lipolyuretics such as beta-blockers, Clonidine, Guanethidin and reserpine.</seg>
<seg id="2985">There were no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin injures into human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter the breast milk nor is resorbed to oral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed, sorted by system organclasses and ordered according to declining frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (frequency based on the available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold-weldiness, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, dizziness, excessive stress, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is neglected to continually change the injection site within the injection area, and may result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous glucose to be treated by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a risk of agonizing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the active time is shorter than with normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50, insulin-lulisin showed a dose of proportionate glucosa-lowering effect in the therapeutically relevant metering range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 e / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a double as fast effect as normal human insulin and gains the full glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that in an application of insulin-lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a similar post-pranic glycaemic control is achieved as with a human insulin acting insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin was taken in 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-flagrated check was achieved than with the normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned into 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a similar glycaemic control like in the normal insulin acting 2 Mi- grooves in front of the meal is achieved (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin-lulisin at application 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal in comparison to the normal insulin which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to the normal insulin acting 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-lulisin at application 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal in comparison to the normal insulin analog, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
